What is Conversion API tracking?
Conversion API tracking is essentially a smarter way for businesses to keep an eye on how well their ads are doing. Instead of using old methods that miss key details because of browser or privacy issues, this method sends data directly from your company's server to the ad platform's server. This gives you a better view of what's happening, like sales or sign-ups, because of your ads. It avoids the usual online problems and privacy worries, giving you a clear picture of how well your ads are doing.
How does conversion API tracking work?
Conversion API tracking operates through an S2S communication channel, a more reliable and privacy-compliant method compared to traditional client-side tracking mechanisms like cookies.

Imagine someone clicks on your advertisement and then does something important on your site, like buying something or signing up for your newsletter. This action sets off what's known as a conversion event within your website's system. Instead of counting on a pixel on the web browser to catch this event - which might not work if someone is using an ad blocker or if the browser has tough privacy settings - your server picks up on this activity directly.

Next, your server puts this event information into a neat package, often using a format called JSON, and sends it over to the ad platform's server with something called an HTTP POST request. This step is carried out using the ad platform's Conversion API, a special tool built for handling these kinds of data transfers from one server to another.


Conversion API tracking alternatives
To appreciate the innovation behind Conversion API tracking, it's essential to understand its predecessors:

 	Pixel Tracking: Relies on a small piece of code (the pixel) embedded on a webpage, which signals a server when a page is loaded. While effective, its reliance on browsers makes it vulnerable to cookie restrictions and ad blockers, leading to data loss and inaccuracies.
 	Postback Tracking &amp; S2S Tracking: These methods facilitate data exchange between servers after a specific action is completed. They offer improved data security and accuracy but need more direct integration and comprehensive data capture of Conversion API.

See our post on Tracking Pixel and S2S Postback URL tracking.

With the advent of Conversion API tracking, marketers now have a solution that combines the best of both worlds: the comprehensive data collection of pixel tracking and the reliability and privacy compliance of server-based methods.


Benefits of Conversion API Tracking
When you look closer, the benefits of this approach are even more evident:

 	Privacy First: With laws like GDPR in Europe impacting over half a billion internet users and CCPA in California, the server-side method of the Conversion API prioritizes user privacy in data tracking.
 	Bypass Ad Blockers: With 42.7% of internet users worldwide using ad blockers, traditional data collection is often compromised. The Conversion API sidesteps these issues, offering a complete picture of user activities.
 	Unified Customer Journey Tracking: As users frequently switch among an average of 3.6 devices, keeping track of their journey can be challenging with old methods. The Conversion API connects these dots, offering a cohesive view across devices and platforms.
 	Instant Data Insights: The Conversion API enables real-time data sharing, allowing advertisers to adapt to trends and adjust campaigns for optimal performance quickly.
 	Tailored Tracking: This approach lets advertisers customize and monitor various actions specific to their objectives, such as online purchases or lead captures, ensuring the data is precisely what they need.
 	Secure Data Transfer: Direct server-to-server data transmission reduces the chances of interception, keeping sensitive customer information safe and secure.

Drawbacks of conversion API tracking
While Conversion API tracking offers numerous advantages, it's not without its challenges. Technical complexity and integration issues can pose significant hurdles. However, by leveraging documentation provided by ad platforms and possibly partnering with technology providers like RedTrack, advertisers can navigate these challenges successfully.
