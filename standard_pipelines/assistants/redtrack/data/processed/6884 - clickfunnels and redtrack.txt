var parts = value.split("; " + name + "=");
if (parts.length == 2) return parts.pop().split(";").shift();
}
var rtCookie = getCookie('rtkclickid-store')
//create request with its properties (you can add to the postback &amp;type=transaction &amp;status= &amp;event= &amp;sum= like in custom image postback)
var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
request.open("GET", `https://tracking.domain/postback?clickid=${rtCookie}&amp;type=ViewContent`)
//optional - to read our response code :create callback for success containing the response
request.success = function(response) {
console.log(response);
};
//optional - to read our response code : and a fail callback containing the error
request.fail = function(error) {
console.log(error);
};
