3. Activate the “Conversion Event Name”&nbsp;in Outbrain and add it to the S2S postback link



This is required for sending conversions back to Outbrain. To do that:

4. Create a Campaign&nbsp;in RedTrack with Outbran as your traffic channel

for Advertisers




4.2 In Campaign settings scroll down to&nbsp;S2S Postback for Outbrain → press&nbsp;Add → check if the parameters are in place → press&nbsp;Save:











Important!▸ If you changed the Postback URL in the Traffic channel (added/removed some parameters to it), remember to manually update the link in Campaign settings as well, as it won’t be generated correctly automatically.▸ Some Traffic channels require you to edit the Postback with specific parameters for each Campaign (e.g., the goal for Exoclick or ap_key for Go2Mobi). If the field remains blank or something like “REPLACE” is stated, that means you need to define the Postback conditions manually.



4.3 Once you’ve saved the Campaign, a&nbsp;click URL&nbsp;(your tracking link) is automatically generated and can be copied from the Tracking links and parameters section:
