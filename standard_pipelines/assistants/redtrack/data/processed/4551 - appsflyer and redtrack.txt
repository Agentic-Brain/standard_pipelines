# AppsFlyer and RedTrack






AppsFlyer is a mobile advertising attribution solution that helps marketers pinpoint their targeting, optimize their ad spend, and boost ROI. AppsFlyer helps you keep track of all app-related events that are generated by clients. 



When working with AppsFlyer you should know that this tool:




requires you to submit your app and install their SDK in your app. This piece of code will ping AppsFlyer and send data. There are two types of events recognized by AppsFlyer: app install and in-app events. The first one occurs when a visitor downloads and installs an app. The second event type occurs on occasions defined in the SDK, such as reaching a certain level in a game or making an in-app purchase.



supports various media sources, such as Self-Reporting Networks (SRNs) (e.g. Google or Facebook), Owned media, and Attribution links.

When AppsFlyer sends RT install it's not possible to attach the mapped to partner event to it so Appsflyer sends it without it and RT receives it as default conversion. In order to avoid getting the Install events as simply Conversions on the RT side, Install type should be add in RT to the "Default” conversion type field (just like in the screenshot).
