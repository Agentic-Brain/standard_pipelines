# WooCommerce and RedTrack










WooCommerce (WooCom)&nbsp;is a flexible, open-source commerce solution built on WordPress. WooCommerce empowers small and medium businesses to build exactly the store they want and sell online.



Integrations steps





Make sure to have the added сustom tracking domain.



RedTrack supports plugins for Subscription tracking such as YITH WooCommerce Subscription and official WooCom subscriptions. As for the upsells, RedTrack supports WooFunnels Funnel Builder Pro. For more details on WooCom subscription info click here.





1. Create custom conversion events.



1.1 Before you add the events for WooCom in RedTrack study these 2 categories of WooCom events which can be tracked with RedTrack:





1st category includes standard events which will be tracked once these events are&nbsp;added to RT&nbsp;and the WooCom &lt;-&gt; RT integration is done as per this guide. These events are:




ViewContent



AddToCart



InitiateCheckout



Purchase






2nd category of events are custom ones. They are:




Subscription



Upsell



Downsell



OrderBump




In order to track the events of the 2nd category, in addition to the WooCom plugin you also need to get WordPress (WP) plugins aka funnel builders. These plugins/funnel builders are:&nbsp;One Click Upsell,&nbsp;WooFunnels, and Upsell Order Bump.



Check out which events can be tracked with each additionally added plugin/funnel builder for WooCom:

Pay special attention to the following:☛ Although such events as “Subscription” and “Upsell” are tracked 100 % with such additional plugins as “One click upsell”, “WooFunnels” or “YITH WooCommerce Subscription”, in theory, they can also be tracked with any other plugins. That being said, the decision to test other plugins (except for “One click upsell”, “WooFunnels” or “YITH WooCommerce Subscription”) for tracking these events can be a bit risky due to this workflow not being entirely tested and verified.☛ For the “Purchase” event to be tracked in RedTrack, the order must have the status Completed / event marked payment_complete in WooCom.☛There is a difference between Upsell and Downsell:Upsells are products that you recommend instead of the currently viewed product.Downsell offer is the one that you make to your customer after they’ve turned down your initial upsell offer. So if the customer didn’t accept your upsell offer, you can still increase their AOV by offering a downsell:☛ Purchase vs Subscription:If a customer sells subscriptions, his purchases = subscriptions.If the customer sells goods or services, his purchases = purchases.





1.2 To add the events in RedTrack go to Tools → Conversion tracking →&nbsp;Conversion types → set the events for WooCommerce. Use this guide to help you with conversion events in RedTrack.



2. Create a custom&nbsp;Brand.



Brands → New from scratch → use this guide to help you add your Brand



The specified title of the shop will correspond to the Brand name. The newly created Brand will serve as a placeholder for the tracking parameters.



3. To send the PII data for better attribution go to the added Brand settings →&nbsp;Additional parameters&nbsp;→ add the following parameters with the corresponding roles:

4. Add your&nbsp;Website.



Websites → New → use this guide to help you add your website



Once you’ve added your Website, you already have the universal tracking script generated for you automatically. To get it, in your Website form → Scripts → choose WooCommerce from the E-com integrations drop-down → copy the script:



5. Create a paid traffic campaign.



The campaign for the unattributed (organic) traffic is already in place. Now you need to create the one for the paid traffic. To do that:




Add the&nbsp;Traffic channel. Most of them have a preset template in RedTrack.



Launch a campaign&nbsp;for the paid traffic channel. Your website/shop will be the main link added to the traffic channel.
