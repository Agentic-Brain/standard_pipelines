# RedTrack Referral Program


Referral Program in a nutshell



Referral program is the gateway for you as a customer to spread the word about RedTrack to your colleagues, friends, and acquaintances in exchange for some pleasant bonuses. With this program, you can generate high pay-outs for every friend you refer, and invite as many friends as you want.



- RedTrack Referral Program does not work for your colleagues in multi-use access (shared account status).- RedTrack Referral Program is available only for active RedTrack users (hence, our community). This offer is not available for influencers, partners, and other businesses looking to get affiliate commissions.Please study our RedTrack Referral Program terms and conditions document to be aware of the liabilities from both sides: you and RedTrack.



Benefits for Referrers and Referees



Once you, as a customer, decide to participate in the Referral Program, you become a Referrer, while the person you’re recommending RedTrack to becomes your Referee.




As a Referrer, you get a 10% lifetime commission from your referee's payments.



Your Referee gets a free trial with RedTrack.
