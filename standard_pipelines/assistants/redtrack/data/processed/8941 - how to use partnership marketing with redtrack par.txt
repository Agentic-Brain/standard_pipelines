Let‚Äôs investigate together how Partnership Portal by RedTrack is able to support your marketing whether you choose to partner up with affiliates, referrals, or influencers.¬†
What is partnership marketing?¬†
Partnership Marketing is a way to collaborate with other businesses or simply partners in order to achieve the marketing (and therefore, financial) goals of all the partners. 
Partnership marketing can take many forms: from cross-promos of 2 businesses to affiliate links. But the core of the method is simple: to use the power of another person, business, or brand to promote your own.¬†
Different types of partnership marketing¬†
Today we are going to talk about 3 ways to collaborate through partnership marketing: affiliate program, referral program, and influencer marketing using RedTrack‚Äôs Partnership Portal.¬†
How to start an affiliate program with Partnership Portal by RedTrack
Affiliate program ‚Äî is a special type of marketing when you introduce affiliate marketers as advertisers for your business.

How to track affiliates' performance with Partnership Portal
Once your affiliates are signed up, they get access to the Portal with all the conditions of the affiliate program you run. You can set custom conditions for each campaign you run, or even customize it depending on the affiliate.

This is the list of rules and conditions you can set for your affiliate program:

 	type of payout (RevShare, CPA, etc.)
 	amount of payout (whether it's a percentage or fixed sum)
 	allowed OS for traffic
 	allowed devices for traffic
 	allowed locations for advertisement
 	you can also add creatives that affiliates can use for campaigns

Once you fully describe the future campaign (on the admin side), your affiliate will see the campaign description in the Portal, as well instantly receive different types of tracking links to control the performance.

Affiliates can use direct and redirect tracking links, also allowing them to track impressions (if the channel supports it). Affiliates also can see their performance in the main dashboard and control how many clicks and conversions they are bringing to your business.

As an affiliate program owner, you can control the performance of the affiliates through a separate affiliate report, as well as look at it in the main Dashboard (that combines all of your advertising channels).
Just like that, you are able to compare the results from affiliates' campaigns with the rest of marketing channels you are using.

If you don't want to bother yourself with creating an affiliate program, you can always go with referral marketing. It can be simpler in the process setup, but still very fruitful.

You can easily share referral links and enjoy the results of people spreading the word about you, while rewarding them with a small commission.
How to use Multilevel marketing (MLM) with RedTrack
Another way to advance your referral marketing is using Multilevel marketing.
Multilevel marketing (MLM) is a practice of promotion where you reward each level of referral marketers accordingly. That means that all marketers can recruit other members of the network that can work on your promotion.
In order to use MLM in digital marketing, you need special software like RedTrack that allows to reward each level of recruited referral marketers according to their performance automatically.

In the Partnership Portal, you can set the amount of the commission, how "deep" the referral program can go (aka how many levels it can have), and finally what's the decrement for each level (meaning how much less each level of referrals will get). Once you set your requirements, the rest of the process will be performed automatically by RedTrack.
