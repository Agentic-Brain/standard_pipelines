3. Integrate CJ Affiliate with RedTrack.

3.1 Get your Account ID and Token from your CJ Affiliate account ( consult your Account Manager if you're not sure).



3.2 Get back to your RedTrack account → Tools → Integrations → Offer sources → scroll down to the section CJ Affiliate → insert the copied Account ID and Token&nbsp;to the corresponding fields → Save:
