# Landing page before e-com shop


The most common funnel or e-commerce is driving the traffic directly to the shop, either to the main page or to some product. But sometimes, you might need to use a landing page in between, an additional step to increase the conversion rate, for example. If this is your case, then this article will help you to set it up in a proper way so as not to lose the click information on the way.



Within this type of setup, there are 2 different scenarios possible:1. Your landing page has the same domain as the e-com store2. The domains are different.



Follow the steps below, depending on your case:





For example, your landing page domain is landing.example.com, and your e-com store is placed on the same domain shop.example.com.



1. Take the universal tracking script you created for your e-commerce shop (with a cookie domain equal to your root domain: example.com in our example).



2. Place the universal tracking script on your landing page code.



To all the pages if there are a couple of different variants of the landing page on this domain.



3. Proceed with the shop integration if you haven't set up one.





Example: your landing page domain is landing.com, but your e-com shop's domain is shop.com



1. Integrate RedTrack with the shop.



2. Create one more default campaign for this landing page. 



Name it somewhat like "Default Campaign for LP"  to distinguish it from other Campaigns and use it in step 3 below.



3. Create a dedicated universal tracking script for this landing page where:




Choose this option in the Script type field:



The cookie domain will be landing.com (the root domain of your landing page);



The Default Campaign will be the one created within step 2 above (i.e. Default Campaign for LP)




4. Place this universal script into your landing page code.



5. Set the condition for your landing page to lead to your e-commerce shop store. It is done via GTM with the help of the special script created for that purpose:



Set the trigger to be fired on all clicks.



&lt;script type="text/javascript">
 (function() {
    function getCookie(name) {
    var value = "; " + document.cookie;
    var parts = value.split("; " + name + "=");
    if (parts.length == 2) return parts.pop().split(";").shift();
    }
 var utmInheritingDomain = "https://outbounddomain.com", links = document.getElementsByTagName("a");
    var rtClkId = getCookie('rtkclickid-store')
 for (var index = 0; index &lt; links.length; index += 1) {
   var tempLink = links[index].href,tempParts;
   if (tempLink.indexOf(utmInheritingDomain) > -1) { 
     tempParts = tempLink.split("#");
     console.log(tempLink)
     if (tempParts[0].indexOf("?") &lt; 0 ) { tempParts[0] += "?" + 'rtkcid=' + rtClkId  } else { tempParts[0] += "&amp;" + 'rtkcid=' + rtClkId }
     tempLink = tempParts.join("#");
   }
   links[index].href = tempLink;  
 }
}());
&lt;/script>



In the script you need to change the "change.me" part to your e-com shop domain.Example: mywebsite.shopify.shop



It is crucially important that this special script triggers out AFTER the universal tracking script. This can be done with the help of GTM trigger settings.
