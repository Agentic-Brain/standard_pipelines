# [Updated] RedTrack.io Webinar -- What's New in June

Taking into account the influx of members arriving on RedTrack, and the pace it evolves and grows with new features; our team has once reflected on the format of presenting our tracking solution to its existing and new users.
That’s how the idea of monthly webinars was born. During these webinars we will offer a comprehensive insight into RedTrack, guide you through all the features and updates released over a coming month, and answer all your questions regarding our affiliate &amp; performance campaign tracker.
Join us for our first webinar on June 27 at 3 PM (London/ Lisbon time), and learn more about our tracking solution.
