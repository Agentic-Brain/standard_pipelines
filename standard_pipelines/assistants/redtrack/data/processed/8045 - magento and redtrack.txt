# Magento and RedTrack






Magento&nbsp;is a powerful, open-source eCommerce platform that allows businesses to easily build and manage online stores. 



Integration steps





1. Add custom tracking domain.



2. Add conversion events:



Go to Tools → Conversion tracking → Conversion type → use&nbsp;this guide&nbsp;to help you add the needed events.



The full list of Conversion types used for successful Magento integration includes:- ViewContent- AddToCart- InitiateCheckout- Purchase



3. Add Magento as a Brand in RedTrack



3.1 Brands → New from scratch → use this guide to help you fill in the rest of the fields.







The specified title of the shop will correspond to the Brand’s name. The newly created Brand will serve as a placeholder for the tracking parameters.



3.2 To send the PII data for better attribution go to the added Brand settings →&nbsp;Additional parameters&nbsp;→ add the following parameters with the corresponding roles:

4. Add your Website:



Websites → New → use&nbsp;this guide&nbsp;to help you add the website (your offer).



 Once you’ve added your Website, the universal tracking script is generated automatically. To get it go to the added Website form → Scripts → scroll down to the field Universal tracking script and copy it (as you will need it later to insert in Magento):



5. Create a paid traffic campaign:



The campaign for the unattributed (organic) traffic is already in place. Now you need to create the one for the paid traffic. To do that act as follows:




Add the&nbsp;Traffic channel. Most of them have a preset template in RedTrack: API-integrated traffic channels/ Non-API integrated traffic channels.



Launch a campaign&nbsp;for the paid Traffic channel. Your website/shop will be the main link added to the traffic channel.
