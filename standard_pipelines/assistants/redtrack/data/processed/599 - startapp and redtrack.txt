3.&nbsp;Set up the tracking on the StartApp side.



Go to the advertiser dashboard → Campaigns → Create Campaign → fill out the required fields → choose the creative type and submit a name → add your RedTrack Campaign Click URL (copied in step 2) here:







When creating your campaign you insert the final Offer link (or a landing page) in this field, do not use the Campaign URL generated by RedTrack here:



4. Set up the postback URL in RedTrack.



Go to Campaign settings (created within step 2) → scroll down to&nbsp;S2S Postback for StartApp → Add → check if all the needed values for parameters are in place → Save changes to the campaign:











Important!▸ If you changed the Postback URL in the Traffic channel (added/removed some parameters to it), remember to manually update the link in Campaign settings as well, as it won’t be generated correctly automatically.▸ Some Traffic channels require you to edit the Postback with specific parameters for each Campaign (e.g., the goal for Exoclick or ap_key for Go2Mobi). If the field remains blank or something like “REPLACE” is stated, that means you need to define the Postback conditions manually.
