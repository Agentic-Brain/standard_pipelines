Here's Why Keyword Research Matters for PPC affiliates
Anyone who wants to make a decent living with pay-per-click affiliate programs needs to do it on a massive scale. But that's possible only by keeping your keywords relevant. Unless you update them consistently, to only use the most competitive ones, your rival companies might win the upper hand by embedding more popular keywords into their content.

However, keep in mind that it's not enough to get lots of visitors to your affiliate sites. If you want to make money and drive sales, you also need to target the prospects. And there's no better way to do that than using long-tail keywords. Why's that? Because whoever finds you via a search intent expressed using multiple words or even a sentence knows already what they want. They have a clear interest in products and services similar to yours.' You only need to do the last bit of convincing to get the prospect to buy from you.
How to Find Your Niche
Profitable PPC affiliates know that covering too many niches results in the superficial treatment of topics. And that doesn't attract visitors to the content. But picking only one theme enables a marketer to go into details and provide the audience with lots of valuable advice. That way, it's possible for affiliates to grow authority in time, which drives an increasing amount of leads to their websites.

But keep in mind that some niches are more profitable than others. So while it's true that it will be easier for you to produce content when picking topics you're passionate about, you should also consider the popularity of your themes. Here's how to find a niche that interests you and others also:

 	Examine your and your friends' pastime activities. What hobbies are you/they passionate about? Whether it's collecting something, repairing cars, or fishing, you and your friends are probably willing to spend a good amount of cash on supplies and gear.
 	Consider promoting accessories. For example, there's always a demand for supplement gear for specialty goods (cars, photo cameras).
 	Take a look at Google Trends. It's a free source of inspiration that shows you all the niches that people care about at the moment.

How to Use Keyword Research Tools
Did you manage to pick your niche? Then it's time to get to the keyword research. And luckily, thanks to the availability of many different keyword software, the process of finding search terms your audience uses has never been more simple. All you need to do in most programs is to integrate your account on Google Ads PPC and enter your industry and location.
