Ads Manager tab in RedTrack provides information about where your traffic originates based on RT_roles that you can set up for all your tracking links.

RT_roles should be configured in the traffic channel template (in most templates the roles are already in place):

Ads Manager is available for all traffic channels, but only several of them are eligible for automation at the moment:- Meta (Facebook): manage objects with ID (campaign, adset, ad) and manage daily budget.- TikTok: manage objects with ID (campaign, adset, ad).
