What is an attribution report and why it is so useful?



Attribution report shows you the paths customers go through to convert and also provides insights on how your different sources of traffic work together and separately to create conversions for you. This gives you a better sense of your potential customers' conversion paths and can help to optimize even better.



Attribution report is a pro-tool designed for RedTrack clients for a better analysis.
