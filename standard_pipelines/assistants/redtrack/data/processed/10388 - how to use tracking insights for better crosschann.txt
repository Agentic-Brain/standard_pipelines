# How to use tracking insights for better cross-channel marketing

The foundation of solid marketing is understanding what makes your audience tick. 

But if you’re not tracking your efforts, you’re just making educated guesses. 

In this article, we’ll break down how tracking insights can help you see what’s really happening behind the scenes, spot trends, and focus your efforts where they matter most. 

This way, you’re not just reaching your audience - you’re actually connecting with them and growing your impact. Ready? 

Right this way… 
Why cross-channel marketing is crucial
Cross-channel marketing involves reaching and engaging your audience on multiple platforms, such as social media, email, search engines, and more. Each platform serves a specific purpose and provides different opportunities to connect with your audience. For example, your audience might discover your brand on Instagram, search for you on Google, and then decide to make a purchase after receiving an email campaign. 

Today's customer journey is not linear. A potential buyer may interact with your brand in several ways before converting - seeing an Instagram ad, researching on Google, then finally clicking through an email to make a purchase. 

Cross-channel marketing ensures you're consistently present throughout this journey, but keeping track of each touchpoint can be challenging without the right tools. That's where tracking insights come in: they provide a clear, data-driven view of how your audience moves between channels, helping you allocate resources effectively.

One of the biggest challenges in cross-channel marketing is managing multiple touchpoints. Each channel plays a different role in driving conversions, making it hard to know where to focus your efforts. 

Tracking insights address this by showing you which channels are performing best, which ones need improvement, and how they work together to influence your audience's decisions. With this information, you can optimize campaigns for maximum impact.
What are tracking insights?
Tracking insights refer to the data that reveals how customers engage with your brand across various marketing channels. This includes clicks, views, conversions, and more — essentially all the metrics that give you a full picture of customer interactions. 

These insights are crucial for understanding which channels and campaigns are most effective, allowing you to make data-backed decisions.
How do they help?
The value of tracking insights lies in their ability to break down complex data into actionable pieces. You can see at a glance which channels are driving conversions, where you’re losing customers, and how each platform contributes to your overall marketing goals.

 	AI-powered attribution modeling for precise ROI calculation;
 	Efficient integration with multiple marketing channels and platforms;

How to use tracking insights to improve performance 
With tracking data, you can easily identify which channels are performing best. RedTrack’s attribution tools, for example, help you see whether social media, email, or search ads are driving the most conversions. 

Let’s say your tracking insights show that Instagram ads consistently outperform Google Ads in terms of conversion rate. This knowledge allows you to double down on Instagram while refining or reallocating your Google ad spend.

Once you've identified your top-performing channels, you can shift your budget to maximize ROI. If your data shows that Instagram is driving more conversions at a lower cost than Google, it’s clear where more of your budget should go. This approach ensures that you’re spending money where it counts, optimizing your marketing investment.

Different channels call for different strategies, and tracking insights can show you exactly what messaging resonates on each platform. 

For instance, the language that works in a Facebook ad might not perform well in an email campaign. By analyzing the data, you can adjust your content to align with each platform’s strengths, leading to more effective messaging across the board.


Keep your messaging consistent across channels
While it’s important to customize messaging for each channel, you also need to maintain a consistent brand voice. Your audience should recognize your brand and message whether they’re interacting with you on social media, via email, or through a display ad. 

Tracking insights help you achieve this consistency by showing how each campaign is performing in real-time. If one message performs particularly well across several platforms, you can replicate that success elsewhere.

Tracking data allows you to align your overall marketing strategy, ensuring that your messaging is cohesive across all touchpoints. 

For example, if your email campaign emphasizes a promotion that’s also being advertised on social media, tracking insights help you monitor whether these messages are aligned and effective. This creates a hassle-free experience for your audience, no matter where they encounter your brand.
Use attribution models
Attribution models help you understand which channels and touchpoints deserve credit for driving conversions. Different models offer different insights; first-click attribution credits the first interaction a customer has with your brand, while last-click attribution credits the final touchpoint before the purchase. 

Understanding these models is crucial to getting a full view of your customer journey and knowing which channels contribute most to your success. RedTrack takes attribution modeling to the next level by providing:

 	Data-driven attribution modeling;
 	Cross-channel tracking and analysis;
 	Customizable attribution workflows;
 	Real-time reporting and analytics;

Best practices for cross-channel marketing using tracking insights
Clicks are great, but they only tell part of the story. To run successful marketing campaigns, you need to understand how users interact with your content. Here's how to do it.
Use click ID for accurate attribution


Click IDs play a crucial role in tracking user interactions across multiple channels. Each user interaction generates a unique ID, allowing you to track their entire journey across different marketing channels (website, ads, social media). 

This lets you see exactly which channels are leading to conversions, giving you a clear picture of what's working and what needs tweaking.
Leverage 3rd-party data for deeper insights


Combining click ID data with external sources yields valuable insights into user behaviour. 

Imagine knowing if a user clicking your ad has previously interacted with your brand on Facebook; you can by integrating data sources like Facebook IDs, you gain a richer understanding of user behavior. This allows for more personalized marketing and more accurate tracking of your campaigns' effectiveness.
Utilize device and location information for optimization


It's important to understand that not everyone interacts with your content the same way. When you utilize data on user devices and location, you can refine your targeting. 

This means showing ads to the right people on the platforms they use most. You can also tailor your content based on where your audience is located, making your marketing more relevant and impactful.

In a nutshell, click IDs, 3rd-party data, and device/location information work together to give you a complete picture of your audience.
