# Bing Ads and RedTrack










&nbsp;



Bing Ads helps you reach a new group of high-quality customers and increase your return on advertising spend (ROAS). In addition, clients with Bing Ads campaigns often have lower cost-per-click (CPC) and costs-per-acquisition (CPA) than with comparable Google AdWords campaigns.



RedTrack has an API integration with Bing Ads, which gives you the following benefits:




Pause: campaign, creative



Create automated rules



Auto-update cost data



Receive conversion data automatically in your BingAds account.




Integration





Before you proceed with the integration, make sure to have the already added:




Custom tracking domain



Offer source and Offer (if you're an Affiliate)/ Brand and Website (if you're an Advertiser)






1.&nbsp;Add Bing as a&nbsp;traffic channel&nbsp;to RedTrack.



1.1&nbsp;Traffic channels →&nbsp;&nbsp;New from template → find&nbsp;Bing&nbsp;template and press Add:







1.2&nbsp;All the essential parameters are already filled in, so no need to change anything. You can only remove the macros you don’t want/need to use in the&nbsp;Additional parameters&nbsp;section → Save the template:







The blocked (greyed) parameters cannot be changed as these parameters are required for Bing-RedTrack API integration. Leave it as is and do not change the parameters later in the tracking template.



2.&nbsp;Integrate Bing with RedTrack



2.1&nbsp;Once you’ve saved the source template, the “Connect” button under the Bing Ads API integration section becomes active. Since it is a complex API integration, we need to get permission to integrate from Bing first. Press Connect:







2.2&nbsp;Verify your ad account by entering your credentials → allow access to your data:











Once it’s done, you will be redirected back to your RedTrack account settings. This means Bing ads accepted the integration, and you can proceed with adding your account ID.



2.3&nbsp;Copy your Bing Ads Account Id (aid consisting of 9 digits), which can be found in the URL once you log in to your Bing account:







2.4&nbsp;Get back to your BindAds Traffic channel in Redtrack → add the copied account ID (from step 2.3) to the&nbsp;Bing Ads Account Id&nbsp;field in the template →&nbsp;Save changes:







Once you’ve saved the changes in the template, the Active toggle will appear at the top right corner next to the Connected button, which means your account in RedTrack is integrated with your Bing Ads account.



To enable the auto-cost update feature, follow this short guide.



3. Set customized conversion events and map them.



3.1 Use this guide to help you set the customized conversion types to track different conversion events separately and send them to your Bing account.



3.2 Get back to your Bing Traffic channel settings → scroll down to the Bing Ads API integration block → set the mapping → press Save changes to apply them:







Info in the columns Conversion Type, Conversion name, and Category gets to your Bing account settings by API, so you won’t need to adjust any settings related to conversions mapping in Bing, just be mindful of what you are inserting in these columns in RedTrack.▸Conversion type – is the custom conversion type you have set within step 3.1.▸Conversion name – how this conversion type will be displayed in your Bing account.▸Conversion Category – Bing conversion event category. You no longer need to set the category manually in Google Ads, we will send the category with the conversion.▸Conversion scope - determines if the goal applies to all accounts or a specific account.▸Include in “conversions” – set "yes" to add this conversion type to the conversions column in the Bing Ads.If you have filled the event field in the Bing TC settings, the Conversion name field will be filled by the pattern "event name - conversion type" will still be sent:



4. Create a Campaign in RedTrack.
