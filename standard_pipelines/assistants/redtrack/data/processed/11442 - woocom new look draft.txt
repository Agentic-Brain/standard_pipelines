WooCommerce (WooCom)&nbsp;is a flexible, open-source commerce solution built on WordPress. The company started in 2008 as WooThemes and in 2017 decided to focus exclusively on eCommerce. Today WooCommerce empowers small and medium businesses to build exactly the store they want and sell online. Its legacy as an all-remote company endures, growing from three founders in Norway, the United Kingdom, and South Africa to more than 150 team members in 32 countries.







Make sure to have the already added Custom tracking domain.



RedTrack supports such Plugins for Subscription tracking as YITH WooCommerce Subscription and official WooCom subscriptions. As for the upsells, RedTrack supports WooFunnels Funnel Builder Pro. For more details on WooCom subscription info click here.





1. Create custom conversion events



1.1 Before you add the events for WooCom in RedTrack study the following conversion tracking info to understand if you have all the needed elements for the correct setup:



There are 2 categories of WooCom events which can be tracked with RedTrack:





1st category includes standard events which will be tracked once these events are&nbsp;added to RT&nbsp;and the WooCom&lt;-&gt;RT integration is done as per this guide. These events are:




ViewContent



AddToCart



InitiateCheckout



Purchase














2nd category of events are custom ones. They are:




Subscription



Upsell



Downsell



OrderBump




In order to track the events of the 2nd category, in addition to the WooCom plugin you also need to get WordPress (WP) plugins aka funnel builders. These plugins/funnel builders are:&nbsp;One Click Upsell,&nbsp;WooFunnels, and Upsell Order Bump.



Check out which events can be tracked with each additionally added plugin/funnel builder for WooCom:

Pay special attention to the following:☛ Although such events as “Subscription” and “Upsell” are tracked 100 % with such additional plugins as “One click upsell”, “WooFunnels” or “YITH WooCommerce Subscription”, in theory, they can also be tracked with any other plugins. That being said, the decision to test other plugins (except for “One click upsell”, “WooFunnels” or “YITH WooCommerce Subscription”) for tracking these events can be a bit risky due to this workflow not being entirely tested and verified.☛ For the “Purchase” event to be tracked in RedTrack, the order must have the status Completed / event marked payment_complete in WooCom.☛There is a difference between Upsell and Downsell:Upsells are products that you recommend instead of the currently viewed product.Downsell offer is the one that you make to your customer after they’ve turned down your initial upsell offer. So if the customer didn’t accept your upsell offer, you can still increase their AOV by offering a downsell:☛ Purchase vs Subscription:If a customer sells subscriptions, his purchases = subscriptions.If the customer sells goods or services, his purchases = purchases.
