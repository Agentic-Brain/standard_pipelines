Integration





1. Add&nbsp;custom tracking domain.



2. Add conversion events:



Go to Tools → Conversion tracking → Conversion type → use&nbsp;this guide&nbsp;to help you add the needed events.



The full list of Conversion types used with PrestaShop includes:▸ViewContent▸AddToCart▸InitiateCheckout▸Purchase



3. Add PrestaShop as a Brand in RedTrack:



3.1 Brands → New from scratch → use&nbsp;this guide&nbsp;to help you with Brand editing.







The specified title of the shop will correspond to the Brand’s name. The newly created Brand will serve as a placeholder for the tracking parameters.



3.2 To send the PII data for better attribution go to the added Brand settings →&nbsp;Additional parameters&nbsp;→ add the following parameters with the corresponding roles:

4. Add your Website:



Websites → New → use&nbsp;this guide&nbsp;to help you add the website (your offer).



Once you’ve added your Website, the universal tracking script is generated automatically. To get it go to the added Website form → Scripts → scroll down to the field Universal tracking script →  copy the script since you'll need to add to PrestaShop later:



5. Create a paid traffic campaign:



The campaign for the unattributed (organic) traffic is already in place. Now you need to create the one for the paid traffic. To do that act as follows:




Add the&nbsp;Traffic channel. Most of them have a preset template in RedTrack:&nbsp;API-integrated traffic channels/&nbsp;Non-API integrated traffic channels.



Launch a campaign&nbsp;for the paid Traffic channel. Your website/shop will be the main link added to the traffic channel.
