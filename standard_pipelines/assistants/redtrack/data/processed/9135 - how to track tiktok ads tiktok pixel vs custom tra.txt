There are 2 major options when it comes to tracking TikTok Ads: TikTok Pixel or getting a custom tracking solution. In this article, we are going to explore how to track TikTok Ads with both of those methods. What are the benefits and disadvantages of each of them?
Let's get in this article to find out!
How to track TikTok Ads performance
Just like with any paid ads channel, you will have to go through a hassle of a technical setup when figuring out ad tracking. If you start out with small budget, you probably will be good with the TikTok platform for monitoring the performance. But once you are starting to raise your ad costs, the lack of proper tracking of your TikTok advertising campaigns can result in huge losses. 

In order to prevent this, you have to make your choice: TikTok Pixel or a custom tracking solution.


TikTok Pixel to track TikTok Ads
TikTok Pixel is basically same thing as Facebook pixel. It's a piece of code that performs tracking for you and is considered to be client-side tracking (which means usage of third-party cookies). 
The main benefit of using a TikTok pixel for tracking is that it’s relatively easy to set up. You are able to place the code on your website's "thank you" page and it will do the tracking job for you. Check out official tutorial from TikTok. 
Advantages of TikTok Pixel:

 	Conversion tracking: you will be able to track conversions (or sales) coming from TikTok Ads. 
 	Optimization. TikTok pixel allows you to improve optimization by feeding the algorithms more data about the users who are more likely to purchase. The more sales your pixel captured — the better goal optimization you may expect. 
 	Ability to integrate with partners (like Shopify or WooCommerce).
 	Access to custom audiences. When you connect TikTok pixels you get a chance for remarketing activities, creating custom audiences from the data sets that TikTok pixel gathers. For example, you can check where the user drops off the funnel and remarket to this audience later on with a specific ad. 
 	Easy setup. If you worked with Facebook Ads before, you won’t find any problem setting up TikTok pixel, the process is very similar. 

However, as mentioned above, TikTok pixel is using third-party cookies and is an example of coookie-based tracking (or client-side tracking).

 We already created a detailed explanation on what's the difference between pixels and server-side tracking solutions, so be sure to check it out. But let's go over a few disadvantages of using TikTok pixel for tracking. 
TikTok pixel misfires

 	TikTok pixel can easily get blocked due to the activity of the ad blockers
 	TikTok pixel is using third-party cookies and we all know that cookieless advertising future is being forced by Apple, Google, Mozilla, and other major players of the market. Tracking with use of third-party cookies is reaching it's last breath.

Tracking solution for TikTok Ads
An alternative for TikTok tracking would be using a custom solution from ad tracking software. It can be more complicated when it comes to the setup at the beginning. However, it's more trustworthy and reliable. Especially if your tracker is using only first-party data and server-side tracking (S2S), as we discussed above. 

As S2S tracking works without third-party cookies and is not affected by ad blockers, conversion data will have more accuracy, especially if you have a lot of post-iOS 14 device traffic (those devices have more privacy-related restrictions). It’s a secure, privacy-compliant tracking method, which is crucial when we are talking about the cookieless era of advertising. 
Benefits of a third-party tracking solution for TikTok Ads


 	Ad tracker will measure TikTok Ads with more accuracy
 	It can't get blocked by ad blockers or other events
 	Cookieless friendly solution (if you tracker support first-party data)
 	Feeds more data to the algorithms (improves optimization and targeting)
 	You can get granular reports on your campaigns (learn more datapoints about the performance of your ads, like time, location, device type, etc.)
 	Ability to control the costs of your advertising campaigns: the tracker will get the data about ad costs to the report
