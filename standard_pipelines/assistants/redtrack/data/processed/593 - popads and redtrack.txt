3. Set up the tracking on the PopAds side.



3.1 In your PopAds account, go to the New Campaign from Advertiser's panel:







3.2 Fill out the necessary information regarding your desired traffic. Insert the Campaign URL to the URL field:







4. Set up the postback with PopAds.



4.1 Go to your newly created campaign → Conversion Tracking:







4.2 Copy the "aid" value from the Postback link:







5. Set up the postback URL in RedTrack.



Go to Campaign settings (created within step 2) → scroll down to&nbsp;S2S Postback for PopAds → Add → check if all the aid value and other possibly needed parameters are in place → Save changes to the campaign:











Important!▸ If you changed the Postback URL in the Traffic channel (added/removed some parameters to it), remember to manually update the link in Campaign settings as well, as it won’t be generated correctly automatically.▸ Some Traffic channels require you to edit the Postback with specific parameters for each Campaign (e.g., the goal for Exoclick or ap_key for Go2Mobi). If the field remains blank or something like “REPLACE” is stated, that means you need to define the Postback conditions manually.
