What Grand Annual Subscriptions Deal is all about?

In just a year RedTrack has released and perfected a great bunch of unique tracking and management features, creating value for the clients and keeping prices steady:

- Impression tracking
- Google parallel tracking
- Cookieless tracking method 
- Conditional postback option and S2S postback with Google
- Granular reporting with 30+ data points
- Fraud detection
- Publisher panel
- Dedicated tracking domain and many others


Following market trends and clients needs, RedTrack is not going to stop adding new features and tools. With this, in September we’ll review all our subscription plans. This is an evolutionary change, so don’t expect any major. Starting in autumn, our current and future released tracking, management, and optimization tools will be available at a new price. However, it will not affect RedTrack clients who will subscribe to annual plans until September 1. They will continue to get all product updates and improvements at Sale Prices.
