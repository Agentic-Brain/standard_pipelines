[wptabs id="7039"]
Note!

If there are already some UTM parameters in the URL parameters field, you do not have to delete them, just append the parameters taken from your campaign in RedTrack to the already existing parameters with the help of the ampersand symbol: “&amp;”.

Such core automation features as Auto cost update and Rules are not available for RedTrack Unlock users, which you should take into account when following the above-mentioned guides. Meaning, you can set a rule or switch on an auto cost toggle, but these features won't work out for you. To optimize your experience with RedTrack you should switch to the paid plan.
