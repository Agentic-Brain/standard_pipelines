Payout is the amount you get paid for the conversion.



With RedTrack you can track your conversions in 2 different ways: dynamically and statically.





This method offers you an effective and accurate method of tracking using a dynamic payout token or fixed value in your S2S postback URL or tracking pixel.If your affiliate network supports a dynamic payout token, it will send it back to RedTrack via your postback URL / pixel for each registered conversion via our supported&nbsp;{sum}&nbsp;parameter.

The parameter will vary for each particular network, so please contact your Account manager for the correct one.

You can record payout by using a fixed payout value in the offer settings. To set it up go to Offers → Main tab → set the payout value per each registered conversion in the Default conversion revenue field:
