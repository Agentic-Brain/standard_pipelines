# HighLevel: webhooks draft


Workaround for those who don't have a Trigger tab in the interface of their HighLevel account 



For accurate HighLevel ↔ RedTrack integration on the HighLevel side you have to:




Add RedTrack Webhook URL.



Add&nbsp;clickid&nbsp;parameter&nbsp;to the HighLevel form.




Implementation of this setup depends on whether you have a Triggers tab in your HighLevel account or not. For those who don't have a Triggers tab, there is a workaround to do the setup via the Workflows tab. Act as follows depending on your case:





1. Add&nbsp;RedTrack Webhook URL&nbsp;to your HighLevel account



1.1 Go to your HighLevel account →&nbsp;Automation → Triggers →&nbsp;Add Trigger:







1.2 In the pop-up window give your&nbsp;Trigger&nbsp;a name → select the folder you want to put it in →&nbsp;Save:







1.3 Paste the generated RT webhook URL to the form → select&nbsp;Active:







The template of the RT Webhook URL is https://defaultrtdomain.rdtk.io/postback/custom/gohighlevel/APIkey where you need to:▸replace defaultrtdomain.rdtk.io with your actual domain:▸ replace APIkey with your actual API key.



2. Add&nbsp;clickid&nbsp;parameter&nbsp;to the HighLevel form



2.1 Go to&nbsp;Settings →&nbsp;Custom fields → fill in the mandatory fields → Save:







Values to put in the fields:Name of the field = rtclickidPlaceholder = {clickid}Object = Contact



2.2 Fill in the mandatory fields →&nbsp;Save Form → press&nbsp;Integrate Form&nbsp;to apply the changes to it:











Values to put in the fields:Field Title: rtclickidPlaceholder: {clickid}Query key: rtclickidHidden Value: {clickid}









1. Go to your HighLevel account → Automation → Workflows → Create Workflow:







2. Choose Webhook → fill in the mandatory fields → Save action:











Values explained:




Method: POST



URL: RedTrack Webhook URL




The template of the RT Webhook URL is https://defaultrtdomain.rdtk.io/postback/custom/gohighlevel/APIkey where you need to:▸replace defaultrtdomain.rdtk.io with your actual domain:▸ replace APIkey with your actual API key.




Custom data: rtclickid → select hidden custom field {{contact.rtclickid}}




To activate this field click to the tag next to this field → Contact → Custom fields → rtclickid:




Custom data: convtype → define the conversion event you added in RedTrack




If the webhook passes the clickid but does not pass the conversion type or the conversion type does not match the types in RedTrack, the conversion will be recorded in RedTrack as the default conversion type.
