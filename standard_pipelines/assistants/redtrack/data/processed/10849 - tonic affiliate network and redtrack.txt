Before you proceed with the integration, make sure to have the already added:




Custom tracking domain



Traffic channel






1. Add the conversion types to RedTrack.



Tonic supports the following conversion types sent dynamically:▸redirect▸view▸viewrt▸click▸preestimated_revenue▸estimated_revenue▸estimated_revenue_5h



The data by these conversions is passed into RedTrack via the {type} parameter in the Postback URL. However, if you need to pass any other conversion types, you can easily do it with RedTrack. Choose the way:





1. Tools → Conversion tracking → Conversion type → add those you want to use. Use this article for guidance.



2. Add the {type} parameter to the Additional parameters section in your Offer source template so that this parameter is appended to the Postback URL









1. Tools → Conversion tracking → Conversion type → add the target events. Use this article for guidance.



2. Hardcode the needed event types to the needed Postback URLs by adding &amp;type=hardcoded_name. 



For example, if you need to get certain events as Purchases, you add to the Postback URL &amp;type=Purchase, so the Postback URL will look like this: https://docs.trk.agency/postback?keyword={keyword}&amp;timestamp={timestamp}&amp;currency={currency}&amp;type=Purchase&amp;clickid={subid1}&amp;sum={revenue}
