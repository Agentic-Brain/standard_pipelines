4.1 To set up conversion tracking in Adskeeper, first, you need to start a new Campaign.



Go to&nbsp;Advertise → Add Campaign → choose the parameters in&nbsp;General&nbsp;and&nbsp;Targeting&nbsp;blocks → save the changes → navigate the&nbsp;Tracking Tags tab and make sure the slider is on.



Tick the&nbsp;Add custom tracking tag. Make sure to put&nbsp;click_id={click_id} here:







4.2 You already have a postback URL available in your RedTrack traffic channel settings. The only thing you will need to adjust is the event name.



Go to the&nbsp;Conversions Sensors tab and set the postback → choose the template for RedTrack → you will get the three postbacks generated automatically – for INTEREST, DESIRE, and ACTION → press OK to save the changes.



The postbacks will be added to your settings:







Copy the one you need (or all of them):







You can change the names of your events:







For a postback for a BUY type replace {revenue} with the {offer_payout}:







After you save the settings on the Adskeeper side, it will automatically suggest you create teasers for your new campaign:







Put the Click URL you have copied from your RedTrack campaign here:







5. Set up the postback URL in RedTrack.



Go to Campaign settings (created within step 3) → scroll down to&nbsp;S2S Postback for Adskeeper → press&nbsp;Add → make sure it contains the correct Adskeeper event name → Save changes to the campaign:











Important!▸ If you changed the Postback URL in the Traffic channel (added/removed some parameters to it), remember to manually update the link in Campaign settings as well, as it won’t be generated correctly automatically.▸ Some Traffic channels require you to edit the Postback with specific parameters for each Campaign (e.g., the goal for Exoclick or ap_key for Go2Mobi). If the field remains blank or something like “REPLACE” is stated, that means you need to define the Postback conditions manually.
