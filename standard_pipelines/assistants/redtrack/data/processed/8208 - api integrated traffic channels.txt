# API integrated traffic channels


RedTrack.io has developed API and CAPi integrations with 20+ ad networks to cover multiple automation scenarios.





The purpose of this feature is to feed data back to the ad network for better attribution and automation by ad network AI.



Besides multiple S2S postbacks, RedTrack.io users can leverage pre-built conversion APIs (CAPI) to send data back to the ad network. Unlike S2S you can opt-in to send ALL conversions (including conversions from other channels) to the ad network compared to sending only conversions attributed to the clicks from that ad network.

The purpose of this feature is to demonstrate real-time cost data in RedTrack.



RedTrack can update your campaign performance data with accurate costs every 30, 15, or 5 minutes. The frequency and depth of cost updates depend on channel API and your subscription plan.



The table below demonstrates Traffic channels and their attributed levels of auto-cost update:

Cost update level depends on the subscription plan: it’s Ad set for Advanced users and Ad for Team &amp; Enterprise users.

These rules are applicable depending on the Traffic channel and the depth of their integration level with RedTrack.





The purpose of this category of rules is ad waste prevention. Pause rules can be of the following types:




Pause Campaign



Pause Ad set



Pause Ad



Channel Placement




These rules monitor the performance of objects (campaign, ad set, ad, placement). When user-specified criteria are met, the set rule will pause the objects to prevent ad waste.

The purpose of this category of rules is ad waste prevention as well. Meaning, these rules monitor the performance of objects (campaign, ad set, ad, placement). When user-specified criteria are met, the set rule will pause the objects to prevent ad waste. The rule will continue to monitor paused objects’ performance. Should this performance improve because of delayed conversions, they will be reactivated.



Pause and Restart rules&nbsp;can be of the following types:




Pause &amp; Restart Campaign



Pause &amp; Restart Ad set



Pause &amp; Restart Ad




Check out the table below on which types of Pause and Restart rules are currently available for the RT integrated Traffic channels:

The purpose of this category of rules is to scale successful Campaigns. These rules monitor the performance of objects (campaigns, ad sets). When user-specified criteria are met, the set rule will try to improve overall performance by increasing bid, budget, or by duplicating ad sets.



Scale rules&nbsp;can be of the following types:




Change Campaign budget



Change Ad set budget



Change Ad set bids



Duplicate Ad set




Check out the table below on which types of&nbsp;Scale rules&nbsp;are currently available for the RT integrated Traffic channels:






Facebook







Facebook




















The purpose of this category of rules is to reduce manual work. Schedule rules do a specific action at a pre-set time, at scale. The most common example is switching objects on/off or raising bids during the hours determined by the user.



RedTrack is currently working on adding the possibility to apply these rules to the major traffic channel players.
