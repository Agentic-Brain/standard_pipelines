# TikTok and RedTrack










TikTok is a social media platform for&nbsp;creating, sharing and discovering short videos.



TikTok has an API integration with RedTrack, which allows you to:




pass all the conversion data back to TikTok.



pause non-converting creatives and campaigns directly on the TikTok side, with no manual work.



auto update your cost data.




Integration





Before you proceed with the integration, make sure you already have:



1. Added custom tracking domain.



2. TikTok pixel and access token.



The following parameters are sent to TikTok upon conversion creation:PixelId - identifies where the conversion is going (e.g.: ABC123XYZ789).PixelKey - API key for pixel access.EventName - type of conversion defined by matching types of conversions between RedTrack and TikTok (e.g.: purchase).EventTime - time for conversion action (it's recorded in UTC and taken from the created_at conversion value).ClickId - click in TikTok (e.g.: EAIaIQobChMI3oztgOuugQMV1uLtCh1Q8A2tEAAYASAAEgIe8PD_BwE). Page - value for the page field from your conversion. Referrer - value for the referrer field from your conversion.Phone - hashed phone value taken from the sub parameter with the assigned Phone role (Offer source → Additional parameters). Email - hashed email value taken from the sub parameter with the assigned Email role (Offer source → Additional parameters). IP - value for the IP field from your conversion. UserAgent - value for the UA field from your conversion.ContentType - hashed value taken from the sub parameter with the assigned Content Category role. e.g.: Entertainment (Offer source → Additional parameters). Contents - hashed value taken from the sub parameter with the assigned Contents role (Offer source → Additional parameters).Currency - a constant USD value.Revenue - conversion sum (in USD), value for the revenue_default field from your conversion.

&nbsp;2. Integrate RedTrack with your TikTok account.

Log in with the email that gives you access to the target ad account → Confirm to accept the integration permissions → select the TikTok ad account from the drop-down list:












3. Add Offer &amp; Offer source (if you are an affiliate) / Brand &amp; Website (if you are an advertiser).



Parameters (their number, spelling, etc.) that can be set for data enrichment differ depending on the offer source/affiliate network.
