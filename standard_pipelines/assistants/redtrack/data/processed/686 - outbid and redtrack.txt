2. &nbsp;Set up the Postback URL from RedTrack in&nbsp;Outbid.



The network allows you to create a Global Postback URL that will apply to all offers, or set up individual Postbacks upon creating an Offer. In our example, we will be adding a Global Postback.



2.1 In your Outbid account go to your Profile settings:







2.2 Find Global Postbacks section → Add Postback → paste the Postback URL (copied from RT in step 1) → Save:







3. Get the Outbid offer URL.



3.1 In your Outbid account go to Offers → Available Offers:







3.2 Open the one you wish to promote → fill in click id macro (the correct parameter for RedTrack is {clickid}). Offer link will be updated automatically → copy it:







4. Add Outbid offer to RedTrack.



In your RedTrack account go to Offers → Create new offer → fill in the mandatory fields → add Outbid offer link in the URL field → make sure “sub2={clickid}” parameters are added at the end of the offer URL → Save:







Refer to this guide for details on how to fill in the rest of the fields in the Offer form.



5. Create a&nbsp;campaign in RedTrack&nbsp;with the traffic channel you buy the traffic from and the offer you have just added.
