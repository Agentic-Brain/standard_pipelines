# How machine learning is changing the way we track ads

Every dollar spent on advertising should bring a return. But with so many marketing channels and touchpoints, figuring out which ads actually lead to sales can be tough. Traditional attribution models often miss the mark, leaving marketers unsure of where to invest.

This is where machine learning comes in. It analyzes large amounts of data to uncover patterns we might miss, providing deeper insights into customer journeys. In this post, we’ll look at how machine learning is changing ad attribution, helping you make better decisions, optimize your campaigns, and boost your ROI.

Let’s dive in!
What is ad attribution?
Ad attribution refers to the process of determining the user actions that led to the desired outcome between the click of the ad and the conversion. It's figuring out what ad led to a desired action (like sign-up, link clicks or purchase). 

For instance, if you generated a sign-up, attribution is about retracing your new lead’s steps with tools to figure out where they came from. With that knowledge, you can determine your most and least profitable channels. 

Similarly, accurate ad attribution is critical for marketers because it helps them understand the effectiveness of your marketing campaigns and optimize them for better results.
Types of ad attribution models
Marketing attribution models help you figure out which ads and interactions work. They show you what led to a sale, sign-up, or other desired action. This way, you can see what's really making your marketing efforts successful and make better decisions. 

Generally speaking, there are 6 main ad attribution models, each with its approach to assigning credit to different touchpoints. They are:
First-touch attribution model
The first touch attribution model is one of the most straightforward methods for assigning credit to different touch points along a customer’s journey. In this model, all the credit for a conversion is given to the very first interaction that a customer has with your brand. 

It's especially relevant when looking at first-click data to identify the channels driving initial engagement, as explained in the context of broader marketing attribution strategies. For example, if they first click on an ad or visit your website, that gets the credit

The best part? It's super easy to understand and use, making it a great starting point for businesses new to attribution modeling.

If your focus is on how well your marketing sparks initial interest and awareness, this model is especially effective. It works best for businesses where customers typically make quick decisions after their first contact, making it perfect for short sales cycles.
Last-touch attribution model
The last-touch attribution model takes a different approach by giving all the credit to the final interaction that led to a conversion. Instead of focusing on the first touchpoint, it zeroes in on the last action a customer takes before making a purchase.

This model is commonly used in platforms like Facebook, where attribution often centers on the last-click data, highlighting the final steps before a conversion.

This model is particularly valuable when your goal is to understand the direct actions or touchpoints that trigger conversions. It’s well-suited for businesses with quick, straightforward sales cycles, where customers typically make a purchase shortly after their last interaction.
Linear attribution model 
The linear attribution model is a fair and balanced way to give credit to all the touchpoints a customer interacts with. Unlike models that give all the credit to just one interaction, linear attribution splits the credit evenly among all touchpoints. This shows how each interaction works together to lead to a sale or sign-up, giving you a more complete picture.

It’s an approach that aligns well with the need to manage and analyze data from various sources, ensuring a holistic understanding of campaign effectiveness.

It is perfect for seeing the big picture of your customer's journey. It helps you understand how all the different touchpoints work together to drive sales or sign-ups. This model is especially useful for businesses with simple customer journeys and multiple marketing channels, as it clearly shows what's working and what's not.
Time-decay attribution model 
The time decay attribution model is a smarter way to give credit to touchpoints. It knows that the interactions closest to the sale or sign-up are usually the most important, so it gives them more credit. This model understands that the further along a customer is in their journey, the more impact each touchpoint has on their decision.

This model is perfect when you want to balance recognizing the impact of recent interactions and acknowledging the role of earlier touchpoints. It's especially useful for businesses with straightforward customer journeys, where the influence of touchpoints grows stronger as customers near a decision. 
Position-based attribution model
The position-based attribution model (also called the U-shaped model) gives credit to touchpoints in a balanced way. It prioritizes the first and last interactions but also recognizes the importance of the middle steps. This model is ideal for businesses that want to emphasize both the initial spark that grabs customers' attention and the final push that leads to a sale or sign-up.
Data-driven attribution model
This model is an advanced approach that uses data analytics and machine learning to precisely measure the impact of each touchpoint on sales or sign-ups. If your business is themed with complex customer journeys, this model is perfect for you—where multiple interactions influence the final decision. This model provides the most accurate picture of what's driving conversions.

If you have the necessary data and resources, this model can offer valuable insights that simpler models can't, helping you improve your marketing strategy.
Challenges in traditional ad attribution
Attribution is key to understanding the customer journey and measuring the effectiveness of PPC advertising. It's about identifying and crediting the touchpoints that lead to a conversion. However, attribution comes with challenges that marketers must address to get an accurate picture.

These challenges includes:

 	Data fragmentation: Data is spread across many channels and platforms, making it hard to track and analyze.
 	Cross-device tracking: Customers use multiple devices, making it hard to track their journey.
 	Attribution models: Choosing the right model to credit touchpoints is tricky, as different models give different results.
 	Offline conversions: Connecting offline sales to online touchpoints is tough.
 	Ad fraud: Fake clicks and traffic mess up attribution results.

Furthermore, to overcome these challenges, you can:

 	Consolidate data
 	Track devices
 	Choose the right attribution model
 	Connect offline sales
 	Stop ad fraud (if involved)

How machine learning drives sales
Machine learning improves ad attribution by providing a more accurate understanding of how ads drive sales. Here’s how:
Data handling and integration
Data handling and integration refer to the process of collecting, processing, and combining data from multiple sources into a unified view, enabling organizations to consolidate data, eliminate silos, and improve accuracy and insights.

In attribution, it helps link customer interactions across touchpoints and devices, providing a comprehensive view of the customer journey for accurate attribution.

Machine learning algorithms handle and integrate vast amounts of data from multiple sources, providing a complete and accurate picture of the customer journey. This includes:

 	Collecting data from various touchpoints, such as social media, search engines, display ads, email marketing, and offline interactions;
 	Integrating data from different platforms, like CRM systems, mobile apps, and websites;
 	Processing large volumes of data in real-time, ensuring timely insights;
 	Identifying patterns and connections between data points, revealing how each touchpoint influences the customer's decision;

By applying machine learning to customer journey data, businesses can gain valuable insights into:

 	Intricacies of customer behavior, including preferences, interests, and decision-making processes;
 	Correlations between specific touchpoints, channels, and customer actions;
 	Underlying factors driving conversions, sales, or other desired outcomes;
 	Areas of friction or drop-off points in the customer journey.

With these insights, businesses can inform data-driven decisions, optimize marketing strategies, and improve ROI.
