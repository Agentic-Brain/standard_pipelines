Important insights about Digistore24 conversion tracking!1. Digistore24 allows you to track conversions in 2 ways: by adding to the end of the postback URL dynamic macros supported by digistore24 or &amp;type=yourconvtypename. You can combine the two ways or use only one of them. But mind that the workflow for setting up conversions tracking via each way is different.2. There is a special workflow for Initiate Checkout event tracking. The details for each case are described below↓





1. Study the correlation between Digistore24-supported dynamic macros and the events you should add in RedTrack.



Digistore24 supports 4 dynamic macros. Each macro corresponds to the events you want to track with its help:




{transaction_type}&nbsp;= payment, refund, chargeback.



{order_type}&nbsp;= initial_sale, upsell.



{billing_type}&nbsp;= single_payment, subscription, installment



{billing_status}&nbsp;= paying, completed, aborted.




Use only the macros corresponding to the conversion types you want to track. You don't need to add all of them if that's not your case.



So if you want to track such events as "payment, refund and chargeback" you should add them to RedTrack and add {transaction_type} macro to the end of the Postback URL in digistore24. Use this table for a reference:

2. Add the events you want to track with Digistore24 in RedTrack. To do that go to Tools → Conversion tracking → Conversion type. Refer to&nbsp;this guide&nbsp;for details.







Event names in RT should be the same as they are spelled in Digistore24 (small letters, with or no spaces, etc.)



3. Add the needed macro(s) to the end of your Postback URL in Digistore24.





1. In your digistore24 account go to Account → S2S postback → Add s2s postback integration:







2. Add the copied postback URL from RT to the Postback URL field → add the needed macro to the end of the URL string → mark the needed events in the For order event field → Save:







It goes one macro per one postback. To add another macro, you need to add another postback.

1. In your digistore24 account go to Account → S2S postback → Add s2s postback integration:

In the "For order event" field you tick the event that logically matches the custom event type in the postback URL.



It goes one event per one postback. To add another event, you need to add another postback.
