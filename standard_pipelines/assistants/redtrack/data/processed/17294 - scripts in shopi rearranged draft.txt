If you have the Offer form and no automatically generated scripts, then you need to:

  const checkout = event.data.checkout;
  const orderId = checkout.order.id;
  var s = document.createElement( 'script' );
  s.setAttribute('src', 'https://tracking.domain/order_completed.js?shop=storedomain.myshopify.com&amp;orderid=' + orderId);
  document.body.appendChild(s);
});
