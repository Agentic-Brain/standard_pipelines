Start receiving conversion and revenue data (+ad spend for API integrations)You will start receiving the cost data from the integrated traffic channel automatically with the frequency available for your subscription.Here is the accuracy we can guarantee:‚Äì API integrated traffic channel is sending us the cost data, there are no errors in the logs‚Äì For the non-API traffic channel: the costs are set and working (set on a campaign level, received via the macro, updated manually)The visitor makes the purchase/desider action, and the affiliate network sends the purchase or other conversion information back to RedTrack. We guarantee a close to 0 discrepancy for the conversion data between your affiliate network and RedTrack. For the cases when you use the universal tracking script, the conversion distribution between the paid and organic campaigns may vary since RedTrack normally attaches the conversion to the specific touch points tracked.Do not hesitate to ask for any help at this point:&nbsp;support@redtrack.io
