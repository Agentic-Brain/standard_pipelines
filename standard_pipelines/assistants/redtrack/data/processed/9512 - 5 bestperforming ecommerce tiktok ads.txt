How to Evaluate Your TikTok Ads
You can‚Äôt decide if TikTok ads work for you unless you crunch the numbers. Fortunately, there are two options for TikTok conversion tracking:


1. TikTok Pixel
The TikTok Pixel works similarly to Google and Facebook pixels. Once you insert the tracking code into your website, it‚Äôll monitor key metrics.

Unfortunately, TikTok‚Äôs Pixel is client-side tracking. It can get blocked by ad blockers and privacy updates.

With TikTok tracking, your conversions won‚Äôt always be accurate.
2. Tracking eCommerce TikTok Ads with Custom Solutions
Custom tracking solutions integrate with your website and your marketing stack.

Think of it this way: TikTok tracking is a chip your visitors carry on their shoulders when visiting your store. (Sometimes, it falls off before they swipe their card.)

Custom tracking solutions use server-side tracking, which proverbially stands on the door of your business and keeps an eye on the footfall. Since it‚Äôs tech integrated on your end, you get accurate reporting.

An ad tracking tool like RedTrack measures all your conversions, even beyond TikTok. It‚Äôs your marketing headquarters.



&nbsp;

Once you integrate your platforms and channels, you‚Äôll see your metrics in the central dashboard. You‚Äôll know how every channel contributes to your revenue and where you get the majority of conversions from, so you can easily evaluate your return on advertising spend.
