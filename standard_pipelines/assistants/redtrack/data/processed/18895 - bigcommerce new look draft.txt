1. Add custom tracking domain.

Go to Tools → Conversion tracking → Conversion type → use this guide to help you add the needed events. 



This is the list of events supported by BigCommerce:- ViewContent- AddToCart- InitiateCheckout- Purchase



3. Add BigCommerce as a Brand in RedTrack:



3.1 Brands → New from scratch → use&nbsp;this guide&nbsp;to help you with Brand editing.



The specified title of the shop will correspond to the Brand’s name. The newly created Brand will serve as a placeholder for the tracking parameters.



3.2 To send the PII data for better attribution go to the added Brand settings → Additional parameters → add the following parameters with the corresponding roles:

4. Add your Website:



Websites → New → use&nbsp;this guide&nbsp;to help you add the website (your offer).



Once you’ve added your Website, the universal tracking script is generated automatically. To get it go to the added Website form → Scripts → scroll down to the field Universal tracking script → copy the script since you’ll need to add to the BigCommerce later:



5. Create a paid traffic campaign:



The campaign for the unattributed (organic) traffic is already in place. Now you need to create the one for the paid traffic. To do that act as follows:




Add the Traffic channel. Most of them have a preset template in RedTrack: API-integrated traffic channels/ Non-API integrated traffic channels.



Launch a campaign for the paid Traffic channel. Your website/shop will be the main link added to the traffic channel.
