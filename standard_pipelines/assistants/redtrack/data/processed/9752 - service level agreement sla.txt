&nbsp;Product



&nbsp;Client Support



&nbsp;Client Activation






Service agreement





Product: downtime



RedTrack.io calculates unavailability using server monitoring software to measure the server-side errors, ping test results, web server tests, and website tests.



Downtime excludes the cases:




Slowness or other performance issues with individual features (custom scripts used on the page, "heavy" pages, additional redirects, apps, and plugins used)



Issues that are related to external apps or third parties (slow internet connection, "heavy" applications open, various browser extensions)



Any features identified as beta or similar



Scheduled downtime for releases






Product: uptime commitment



Uptime is the percentage of total possible minutes RedTrack.io was available during a quarter.



Our commitment is to maintain at least 99.9% Uptime.





Product: scheduled downtime



Sometimes, we need to perform short maintenance for a release to keep RedTrack.io working smoothly and have all the useful features you may need.



The downtime period is up to 10 seconds in that case, and it does not affect tracking.





Urgency levels and priority for Support Service



  



Live chat support



The live chat service was created for quick question resolutions: something fast or extremely urgent (for us to react as fast as possible). It's 1-line support.



In live chat support, we do not cover funnel setup, onboarding/funnel activation, complex integrations, or script implementation as they require additional time and sometimes the involvement of several specialists. These kinds of questions are to be addressed to the 2-line support.



Interaction is established by using an in-app chat window available in your account's left corner if included in the subscription.



The expected first response for a live chat is 10 minutes. Grown up to 60 minutes within the high load periods and for non-urgent cases.





Email support



This service covers all types of questions and is available any time of the day, any timezone. That means you can write anytime. We will receive your request and put it in a queue. If it is out of working hours, the morning specialist will start processing it as soon as the working hours start. 



Email support covers the 2-line support and also all requests from the clients who do not have a live chat included in the subscription.



The processing of email inquiries is as follows: we prioritize the request (impact + subscription + urgency defined by a client) and address it to an appropriate department or specialist. The higher the priority we define is, the faster the processing is.



Interaction is established by writing to support@redtrack.io

Urgency levels and priority for other services





Activation assistance



It's a standard account activation for our clients.



We do understand RedTrack is not plug-and-play software and help you to start so you can see the value of the product. Activation services available vary depending on your subscription package and the particular use case.



Terms of activation are defined individually after the setup evaluation with our specialist.





On-demand service



An extra cost service is provided upon request after the activation is finished or not included in the subscription.&nbsp;



The pricing and terms are stated only after the request evaluation and are individual from case to case.





Personal manager



Your personal manager will guide you through the product, be available to answer any questions afterwards, provide advice on the best platform usage, and escalate any of your issues with a higher priority.



A personal manager is available 10:00 A.M. to 7:00 P.M, Monday to Friday GMT+3. The request resolution depends on the complexity (deep analysis, check, dev team involvement, etc.)
