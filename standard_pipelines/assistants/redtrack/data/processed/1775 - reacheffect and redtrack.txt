Before you proceed with the integration, make sure to have the already added:

1. Add&nbsp;ReachEffect&nbsp;as a Traffic channel in RedTrack.



Your RedTrack account →&nbsp;Traffic channels&nbsp;→&nbsp;New from template&nbsp;→ find&nbsp;ReachEffect&nbsp;→&nbsp;Add&nbsp;→&nbsp;Save&nbsp;the template:











2. Integrate ReachEffect with RedTrack.



In the added ReachEffect template go to the&nbsp;ReachEffect API integration&nbsp;section → add the&nbsp;ReachEffect&nbsp;API key&nbsp;→&nbsp;Save changes&nbsp;to the template:







The “Active” button means the integration is on:



3. Create a campaign in RedTrack with&nbsp;ReachEffect&nbsp;as your traffic channel.



Campaigns&nbsp;→&nbsp;Create new campaign&nbsp;→ use&nbsp;this guide&nbsp;(for Affiliates) /&nbsp;this guide&nbsp;(for Advertisers) to help you add the campaign with ReachEffect as your traffic channel → once the campaign is added, your tracking link is automatically created, copy&nbsp;Click URL&nbsp;(your tracking link):







Refer to these articles for details on the preferred method of tracking:– Universal script– No-redirect– Impressions



4. Set up the tracking on the ReachEffect side.



4.1 In your ReachEffect account go to Campaigns → Add New Campaign:







4.2 Add your RedTrack campaign Click URL (copied in step 3) to the Destination field inside your ReachEffect campaign settings:







5. Set up the Postback URL in RedTrack.



5.1 In Campaign settings (created in step 3) scroll down to&nbsp;S2S Postback for ReachEffect&nbsp;→ Add:&nbsp;







5.2 Make the following changes to the postback:




pid=REPLACE: instead of REPLACE add your user ID from ReachEffect (i.e. pid=12345abcde).



conv_type=b: put the needed letter instead of "b". It can go from A to Z so you can have multiple events. Each letter corresponds to the particular event name in the ReachEffect platform.








If you changed the Postback URL in the added ReachEffect traffic channel template (added/removed some parameters), remember to manually update the link in campaign settings as well, as it won’t be automatically generated correctly.
