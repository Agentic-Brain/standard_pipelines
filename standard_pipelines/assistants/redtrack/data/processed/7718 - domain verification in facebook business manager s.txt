# Domain verification in Facebook Business Manager: Step-by-step guide

If you doing at least some advertising, you probably already faced issues with Facebook Ads ever since the iOS 14 Privacy Update was released. If you still didn't get your Business Manager blocked (lucky you!), you probably heard about the shift to Facebook Conversion API and a requirement for domain verification in Facebook Business Manager. The latter one has been quite a problem for everyone who does not have access to the domain where the actual conversion event happens.

If you want to learn more about Facebook CAPI, we suggest you read our previous article "How Facebook Conversion API changes advertising?". But if you still haven't figured out how to verify domains (especially when it comes to affiliate landing pages), this piece of content is for you!

Why do you need to verify a domain on Facebook?¬†¬†
Domain verification in Facebook Business Manager requirement came right after the iOS 14 Privacy Update by Apple was rolled out. Domain verification is necessary for Facebook to promote privacy and make sure that only trusted people are using the account.
Besides, when you verify the domain gives you the right to manage permissions over your links and controls the "misuse of your account" as Facebook states.¬†
Note: you can't make edits to your Pages unless your domain is verified in Facebook Business Manager.
Another reason is that after domain verification Facebook receives the data to enable prioritization of 8 conversion events per domain. Without this data, Facebook Business Manager can not make a priority for designated conversion events. The decrease of available conversion events for measurement is also the consequence of the iOS 14 Privacy Update.

Ways of domain verification in Facebook Business Manager¬†
There are 3 main ways to verify a domain in Facebook Business Manager:

 	
DNS Verification;

 	
HTML File Upload;

 	
Meta-Tag Verification.


We find that DNS Verification is the simplest option. It is easy enough for a simple marketing &amp; advertising expert who never made a piece of code longer than "Hello World!" pop up.

However, the DNS verification requires access to the domain settings. Which you typically can not find if you do not own the domain. So that's the case when affiliate marketers &amp; other advertising partners may suffer. Facebook did not provide an opportunity to perform verification for third-party domains. Verification can be made only for domains where conversion events happen ‚Äî this is a way to promote transparency.
