# konnektive and checkout champ (draft)


Konnektive CRM&nbsp;is a campaign and customer management platform that helps marketers automate and streamline complex sales procedures. It is a great web application for managing your products from a logistical and customer-driven standpoint.



CheckoutChamp is&nbsp;a standalone single-step checkout and one-click upsell tool&nbsp;that works with every e-commerce platform, designed to increase sales conversion, and average order value quickly and easily.



Konnektive and CheckoutChamp are essentially the same CRMs with minor differences in name and UI. Both platforms are integrated with RedTrack in the same way. To connect either of the platform with RT follow the integration steps below.
