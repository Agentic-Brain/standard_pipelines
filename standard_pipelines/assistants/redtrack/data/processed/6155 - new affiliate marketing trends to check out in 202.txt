Will there be any significant changes in 2020?
2020 came just recently but has already brought us many surprises. So far, largely shocking ones. And yes, you guessed it right, we mean COVID-19. Whether we want it or not, it has had a significant impact not only on people’s lives but on brands’ cost structure and ad spendings. In China, for example,  47% of businesses reported that their sales had been significantly or severely impacted by the outbreak of the pandemic, and 7% of them had stopped their advertising activities completely. 

While the whole world is living in uncertainty, the challenges are emerging: supply chain issues, cash gaps, changeable consumer confidence, drop in demand, purchasing power loss and so on and so forth. We are not going to turn this post into a list of advice on what vertical you should choose. Just make sure you don’t put all the eggs in travel, luxury, real estate niches. If you're a beginner, try necessity good first. At least in the near future.



Big brands, in their turn, reduced their marketing spend by at least 30% (80% for some subsidiaries), shifting Q1 budgets to Q2 and consider to increase marketing contents associated with positive energy and mainstream tonality. The good news is that there are quite a lot of chances everything will be more or less stabilized by the 2nd half of the year. At least, that's what optimistic analysts say. Anyway, affiliate marketers should find ways to improve their efficiency. Let's see what are the affiliate marketing trends that will help us overcome all the difficulties of 2020.

Influencer Marketing
Influencer marketing is getting widely used in eCommerce, and the same is going to happen in affiliate marketing. The thing is that in 2020 celebrities, or so-called macro-influencers (500K – 1M followers), will start losing their popularity and become less relevant due to rising costs and declining engagement rates. Yes, they have millions of followers, but it has nothing with their ability to influence. The audience's relevance and the engagement rate are the first things you should think about as a marketer.

Micro-influencers’ (10K-50K) typical followers base size may not seem huge, but they are usually more affordable, on the other hand. Micro-influencers have a super-power to tap into defined micro-communities and establish meaningful and productive relationships with their members.

Nano-influencers usually have less than 10K followers. But it's not the case. On top of their relatively low pricing rates and high EG, an ideal nano-influencer has a very specialized fan base that can spread the word around your offer with no additional investments.

Just a quick stats from Rakuten’s 2019 Influencer Marketing Global Survey, if you’re still in doubts on whether to try this affiliate marketing trend or not:


 	65% of consumers discover a new brand or product through an influencer at least once a week,
 	87% were inspired by an influencer to make a purchase,
 	56% of women who follow influencers follow beauty, fashion and entertainment influencers,
 	54% of men who follow influencers follow gaming, tech and celebrity influencers,
 	70% of women prefer Instagram influencers,
 	53% of people find new influencers through social media recommendations,
 	31% of consumers recommend an influencer to friends and family at least once a week.


Voice Search Optimization
&nbsp;

Analysts say that voice search is going to take 50% of the total search volume in 2020, while 30% of all the searches will be done on the devices without a screen. If voice search isn’t a part of your strategy today – then make sure you know how to implement this affiliate marketing trend when the time comes.

The rise of voice search popularity has been caused by the increasing number of people, installing smart speakers to their phones, homes, and workplaces. If the forecasts come true, the rise of this affiliate marketing trend popularity will have a strong impact on the brand's content strategy playbooks, which will have to be optimized for audio queries. By the way, this also applies to you.

&nbsp;



&nbsp;

Today, most of the speakers are made by Google Home, Amazon Echo, Siri or Alexa. And it seems like there are just a few chances this market structure will change. It is interesting that users of 65+ years old use these devices more than others:

 	50% of them use them 1-3 times/day,
 	45% find them reliable and are able to answer their voice queries in 2 to 3 tries. 

What are the best ways to get voice search traffic? The best ways are typically considered to be guides, FAQ and blog section. Work on the content that keeps the conversation going rather than puts a stop to it. Use long-tail keywords and make sure it answers a query or a question.

Data-Driven Marketing
&nbsp;

Data-driven marketing is going to play a key role in 2020 affiliate marketing. Data has become one of the most important factors when it comes to improving your marketing and ad efficiency with little effort on your part.

It’s about delivering them the right message at the right time. 91% of consumers are more likely to purchase from brands that deliver relevant personalized offers and recommendations. The only thing to know what’s relevant to them and what’s not is to use a quality ad tracker to gather important information about them.
Audio and Video Content
&nbsp;

In 2020, video has become one of the top high-performing types of content marketing. It has achieved 135% more organic reach than images, status, and link posts. As to consumers, they spend 3x more time on watching live videos than other forms of content. Facebook executives themselves predict that the platform will be all video by 2021.

&nbsp;



&nbsp;

Along with smart speakers, Streaming audio (AM/FM radio) and pure-play music services are the biggest outlets for brand advertisers today. Podcasts have become one of the key channels for many direct-to-consumer brands. They are not only useful in advertising for products and services but are also a great addition to a classic content marketing mix. Like videos, audio content also performs better than text posts. So, why not follow this affiliate marketing trend? Even though podcasts culture is now only under development stage, now over 51% of the population say they have listened to one of the 700,000 active podcasts in the United States.
