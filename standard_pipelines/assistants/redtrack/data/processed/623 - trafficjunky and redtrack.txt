Important!▸ If you changed the Postback URL in the Traffic channel template (added/removed some parameters to it), remember to manually update the link in Campaign settings as well, as the added values won’t be added automatically.▸ Some Traffic channels require you to edit the Postback with specific parameters for each Campaign (e.g., the goal for Exoclick or ap_key for Go2Mobi). If the field remains blank or something like “REPLACE” is stated, that means you need to define the Postback conditions manually.
