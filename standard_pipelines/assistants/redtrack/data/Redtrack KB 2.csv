721,Will marketers and advertisers still have a job in the age of AI?,"Concerns about robots and AI replacing our workplaces are nothing new. For that, great credit goes not only to the technical uprising but to the well-liked movies like RoboCop, the Matrix, Artificial Intelligence, etc.
Marketing and advertising are the areas where AI is making a huge step forward. To know whether you should worry about your workplace or not, keep on reading.

Market Research Analysts
Every time we type a search request into Google, Bing, or Amazon, we leave a significant digital footprint — our age, gender, location, purchase preferences and more. It takes AI a few seconds to store and analyze all this data. While it would take a person at least several months to do the same.
Artificial intelligence is becoming smarter with its ability to analyze tremendous amounts of data on the fly. This, in turn, puts high expectations on the marketers, who should leverage that data for its further handling and appliance.

— Will AI replace Market Analysts?
— AI might do this in a few years.
&nbsp;
Web Designers
Usually, it takes at least two people to build the business site: a developer and a content marketer. Can the website design itself? San Francisco startup Grid seems to have an answer.
Using the power of AI, the Grid builds the site on the basis of the images and text the user has input in advance. It algorithmically orders and matches the uploaded material, and picks the layout design based on the style of the chosen images. Nevertheless, the age of self-designing websites isn’t perfect (yet?). AI-driven website builders might be a worthy solution for a temporary landing page, but not for a corporate website.

— Will AI show web designers the door?
— Not today, AI, not today.
&nbsp;
Content Managers
The field of content marketing might seem safe from ‘AI invasion’, and for now it might be true. The bots are far from replacing human creativity and ‘personal’ approach to content generation. Still, the reality is a little more complex. Less than a year ago Google invested over $800,000 to the Press Association news agency to start the initiative of writing stories solely with the use of AI.
Today, huge national news agencies like the Guardian and the Associated Press use AI to create local news and sports reports. If the question is “Can AI write content?” The answer is yes, it can. But if “Can it write unique and not-template posts?” The answer is clearly no.

— Should I worry about my job position as a Content Manager?
— AI might replace some field-oriented journalists, e.g. sport-reporters but not the position of content manager as it is.
&nbsp;
SMM Managers
Social networks are becoming increasingly smarter. Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, for example, have learned how to define the content that the users like and which one they prefer to pass by. They use these insights to form a news feed that would correspond to the user’s preferences the best way.
Besides, this deep analytics helps SMM managers to build ad messages, which would reach the desired target audience, without wasting money on the users who are not interested in it.

— Will AI take place of SMM managers soon?
— Not now and not soon. SMM managers may automate a number of tasks using AI, but the communication with the users and their engagement are within the human abilities only.
&nbsp;
Advertisers and media buyers
While setting an ad offer, media buyers and advertisers should keep in mind dozens of parameters. The adjustment of these parameters influences the efficiency of the offer and the revenue it would bring. Because of AI analytics capabilities, it becomes easier for media buyers to optimize their offers and ad campaigns.

— Will media buyers allow the AI to steal their job places?
— No, AI looks like advertiser’s efficient assistant rather than a replacement.
&nbsp;
So far, AI cannot replace any marketing or advertising position completely. Humans are still very much needed since marketing and advertising are not a science, but an art, too.
For now, it’s clear that AI will not replace, but empower the marketers and advertisers, making more and more tasks to become automated.
So, why we started our blog with the topic of AI? RedTrack has recently launched the new version of its affiliate tracking solutions and joined the AI race.
Smartlinks by RedTrack use AI in order to detect which user converts on what offer. The algorithm analysis this data and shows each specific user an offer that is most likely to bring conversion. It means that an advertiser shouldn’t test each offer manually since Smartlinks automatically detects most profitable combinations.

752,A for Antifragile,"If you have not heard about Antifragility book we suggest find time and read it. Written by Nassim Taleb, renowned thinker and author of the “Black Swan”, it offers a view on the world, people, systems, and processes around us through their capability of being antifragile. As Taleb explains in his book, antifragility is fundamentally different from the concepts of resiliency (i.e. the ability to recover from failure) and robustness (that is, the ability to resist failure).
The core idea is simple and quite fascinating. Everything can be divided into three categories: the fragile, the robust and the antifragile.
• Fragile — avoid disorder and disruption for fear of the mess they might make: things look safe, but in reality, you are vulnerable to the shock that will tear status quo apart.
• Robust — can stand up to shocks without flinching and without changing.
• Antifragile — shocks and disruptions make system in question stronger and more creative, better able to adapt to each new challenge it faces.
Here is the definition by the author:


“ Some things benefit from shocks; they thrive and grow when exposed to volatility, randomness, disorder, and stressors and love adventure, risk, and uncertainty. … The antifragile loves randomness and uncertainty, which also means — crucially — a love of errors, a certain class of errors.
By grasping the mechanisms of antifragility we can build a systematic and broad guide to nonpredictive decision making under uncertainty in business, politics, medicine, and life in general — anywhere the unknown preponderates, any situation in which there is randomness, unpredictability, opacity, or incomplete understanding of things.
We can almost always detect antifragility (and fragility) using a simple test of asymmetry: anything that has more upside than downside from random events (or certain shocks) is antifragile; the reverse is fragile.” 



What has Antifragile to do with affiliate marketing?
The affiliate space is always changing, there are always new opportunities and new challenges to what used to work. It perfectly fits the descriptor like volatility, randomness, disorder, and stressors. Some affiliate marketers are seeing growing profits, others fail. There are many explanations for it, but when you view it through the Antifragility lens it all becomes very simple and clear. Fragile and antifragile are relative — there is no absolute.
Nissim Taleb defines three types of systems —
Fragile, Robust and Antifragile





If we apply the same approach to the affiliate marketing we will derive 3 theoretical type of affiliates





Again — it is important to understand that Fragile and antifragile are relative — there is no absolute. One affiliate marketer may be less fragile than the other but he will still be fragile.
The book offers a number of tools and strategies you can implement to reduce the level of fragility and increase the level of antifragility. One of them seems particularly suited for affiliate marketing.

Let’s focus on the barbel — Applying Antifragile concepts to affiliate marketing
“ The barbell (or bimodal) strategy is a way to achieve antifragility and move to the right side of the Triad. Monogamous birds put it into practice by cheating with the local rock star and writers do better by having as a day job a sinecure devoid of writing activities.”
The premise is, you want to play on both sides of the extremes rather than in the mediocre middle (what Taleb calls Mediocristan). In the example of the (non)monogamous birds mentioned above, they settle down with a stable, predictable, albeit boring mate for life, but fool around with the rock star bird (more alpha-male) in hopes of getting better genes for their offspring. The lifetime mate is a long term, stable investment while the rock star is a volatile investment with high upside (in the form of better genes).
The barbell strategy is a way to control the risk of catastrophe while ensuring unlimited gains on the upside. It applies across many domains and especially useful for activities where people involved are agile and able to tinker and take risks that larger, more established business and/or corporations are unwilling to take.
This definition cries “affiliate marketers” for whom the constantly changing environments, experiments, and risks are daily routine.
To implement a barbell strategy, one implements a system of tinkering for the smaller, riskier operations with offers and traffic sources while staying rational on set-ups that yield predictable ROI, even if it is small.
• If the risk offer or traffic source tanks, the loss is not large enough to be catastrophic. However, if the experiment sky-rockets, there is no ceiling to the amount of profits one can take as long as you can pour in more.
• “Rational” part should stay out of the risk zone.
Now, there are three more things to consider:
• a set of criteria to move traffic source or offer from one side of the barber to the other.
• your own definition for the “weights” of the sides — or the budget allocation. it may be 90/10, 80/20 or even 70/30 — as long as losing all on the risk side is not catastrophic and would not influence the predictable side.
• the discipline to follow the rules you set for yourself.
Smartlinks skyrocket your barbel strategy.
So, what role would RedTrack play? With our coming Smartlink feature, you can apply machine learning to test thousands of offers and identify the most profitable one. Automatically. Consider this the ‘risk” side of the barber where AI helps you to make experiments at inhuman scale. You can then hand-pick and move some of them to the “chosen” group that you manage manually to ensure predictable ROI and minimize risks.

776,Take Control Over your Links with Affiliate Tracking Software,"Chances are, 7 out of 10 ad campaigns you’ve launched, would start off unprofitable.
Why?
It’s not a matter of accident or luck.
When an advertiser/ affiliate launches a campaign, they make it based on assumptions about what might work and what not. There are too many settings combinations that influence the efficiency of advertising. And you wouldn’t know it, until launching an ad campaign and starting get some real traffic to it.
So is there any chance to become profitable after an unsuccessful beginning?
The answer is yes. Still, you shouldn’t beat the bushes looking for a four-leaved clover and wait for success, but start tracking the ad performance and keep constantly analyzing it. You can do all that and even more by using an affiliate tracking software.
Good tracking software can save you a lot of money before you find the winning campaign.

What is affiliate tracking software?
It is the software that allows users to create links that, in turn, are used for tracking purposes, as well as managing and optimizing all the traffic that they drive. Tracking software is a way to understand the performance of your campaigns across various traffic sources, landers and offers at a glance.
Putting it simply, tracking software shows all the impressions, clicks and conversions, like the traffic source, the country from where they arrived, what time of the day, what type of phone the visitor used and much more.

With this information, you get access to profound real-time statistics, which is essential for optimizing your further campaigns to profitability.
Here’s an example:

Where,

Click time — identifies clicks by their creation date and time
Campaign — indicates which campaign clicks belong to
Offer — indicates which offer has brought clicks
Country — indicates where clicks were created
OS — indicates OS of the device where clicks were created 
Browser — indicates Internet browser where clicks were created, etc

Can an affiliate run ad campaigns without this data? Sure they can. Would it be as effective and profitable, as it can be with the availability of that data? Resounding “no”.

Where,

Traffic Source — the source where traffic comes from
Clicks — the number of clicks
Conversions — the number of conversions
CPA — the cost per action 
CR — conversion rate
EPC — earnings per click
Revenue — the total amount your affiliate networks earned
Cost — the total amount paid to affiliates
ROI — profitability rate, etc
The difference between a successful affiliate and a poorly-performing merchant is, that the latter one knows only how much money he earns, while the former know how he earns them. For that reason, only a small percentage out of the thousands of new affiliates actually become profitable and choose to quit their day job.
There are a lot of good tracking options nowadays, among which RedTrack.io stands out due to its technologically advanced affiliate marketing tracking &amp; analytics solution.
What is RedTrack.io?
• Fast click redirects;
• Advanced analytics and instant reports;
• Custom dashboard and easy-to-use interface;
• Automatic offer integration through CPAPI and more.
With our coming Smartlinks feature, the detection of profitable combinations becomes automatic for large-scale campaigns. A solution for seasoned affiliated with large volumes of offers and traffic, SmartLinks employ the power of the AI and machine learning to substitute manual testing. It means that an advertiser shouldn’t test each link manually anymore. The algorithms automatically detect most profitable combinations and show each specific user an offer that is most likely to bring conversion.

833,7-Day-Guide to Set your Christmas Affiliate Ad Campaign,"It’s the time of year when digital marketing actually goes out of control. The internet is flushing with social media posts and blogs that suggest what to buy for Christmas or what to wear on Christmas.
Christmas gifts, by certain, is one of the most trending and lucrative topics for retailers now, and it’s a big deal for affiliate marketers too.
The importance of planning cannot be downplayed especially during such a busy holiday period, like Christmas. Thus, we put together 1-week-guide of key actions that would help you to get your ideas in order and ensure your Christmas campaigns to be as successful as possible.


Day 1: Analyzing
Start the preparation-Christmas-week with the analyzing phase — probably the most important part of a successful holiday campaign.
The scale of this phase would largely depend on your prior experience launching Christmas ad campaigns.
For those, who are not engaged in this holiday rush for the first time, it would be insightful to address the performance of their prior Christmas campaigns. Knowing what traffic sources and keywords perform best during the previous holiday season, will be invaluable to you in planning.
Nevertheless, keep in mind that trends come and go, and what has played off in 2016, might not bring the same results in 2017. But more on that later.
For those, who launch Christmas ad campaigns for the first time, we would recommend having a look at what others do during this holiday period. The goal is not to steal their ideas and make money with it, but to detect their strengths and weaknesses and disarm them with your own innovations.
Here are 5 online tools that will help you to spy on the ads, your competitors are running:
• AdEspresso — the library of Facebook ads from businesses all over the world;
• Adsvantage — the database of ads that can be sorted by number of likes, share counts, country, and date;
• Adbeat — a great tool if you know which particular brand you want to monitor. Adbeat gives you access to all the advertiser’s ads, their performance data, ad channels, and many more;

• MixRank — the platform that helps you have a look at the display and contextual ad campaigns of brands that are monetized with the help of Google AdSense.
• Moat — allows you to input your competitor’s brand name, and it will generate you a selection of the ads they’ve recently posted.


Day 2: Budgeting
Your strategic plan would be incomplete without having a budget in place.
Keep in mind that the fourth quarter, December in particular, is the season when all numbers, i.e. the amount of retailers and advertisers, the number of shoppers and ad impressions, are rising. What follows next, is the increase in ad costs and bids.
Don’t be afraid to spend more money during the holiday season. It’s inevitable that all months shouldn’t be treated equally. Raise the bids, but do it strategically, based on the information you’ve collected on Day 1.
On average, be ready to the 30% increase of your ad costs. Besides, always retain some of your budget as a reserve.


Day 3: Deciding on your traffic sources
Let’s put some clarity here, on Day 3 you should not start choosing your traffic sources, but finish testing them.
The traffic sources, ad deals, and creatives — all that should have been already prepared on November (September, the best). Today, you should check the readiness of each one and make some final corrections, if necessary.
In case you didn’t manage to meet the Christmas deadlines, we’ve summed up the key takeaways for you.
The first step is to decide which traffic sources, i.e. advertising channels you will be using for a holiday promotion. You will definitely want to base your choice on the advertising channels you’re most successful with, or the ones that have proved to be the best in previous seasons. That’s the right attitude. Nevertheless, there are some traffic sources that are certain Christmas must-haves, among them:
Email marketing:
Email marketing is the most widely used channel during the holiday season for 2 reasons — it’s free and highly successful:
The number of e-mails users worldwide is forecasted to rise to 2.9 billion users by 2019. (Statista, 2016)
According to Mailchart’s Holiday Email Marketing Guide, email marketing is responsible for 20% of holiday sales.
Social traffic
The best channel here is, for sure, Facebook, due to its exceptional targeting capabilities. Want to target French that lives in Spain, who are aged between 27–56 and have “Fashion” and “Books” listed as interests? Facebook can do it.
Display ads
If done right, it is probably the best converting channel for Christmas period. Still, keep in mind, the competition is extremely high, as well as the ad bids.
We would definitely not advise you to use search traffic during holiday season, unless you’ve started optimizing ad-related keywords in advance (at least three months before the X-day).


Day 4: Building creatives
Of course, it’s important that among a sea of Christmas creatives around the Internet, yours to stand out.

When building the banner don’t fill it with cliches. Your creatives don’t have to be all about Christmas trees, deer, and green-red decorations. Instead, try to think out-of-box, think about your audience. Incorporating unique elements like Christmas photo postcards can add a personal and festive touch, helping you connect with your audience in a more meaningful way.

If for some reason you postponed building your creatives till now, have a look at this list of last-minute creative tools:
• Canva — free online graphic design tool. The platform already has some free templates for social ad banners and also offers generative AI art features to help you create unique, custom designs effortlessly.
• DesignBold — design platform with pre-built templates, that’s quite similar to Canva.
• Snappa — tool that again resembles the previous two. Snappa has a free plan that allows 5 creative downloads per month. It also sustains dimensions for social media, display ads, emails, etc.


Day 5: Tracking
Without the proper ad campaign tracking, you are just on your way to lose a great sum of money. With Insights by Facebook and Google, for example, you can definitely provide yourself with the generic stats like clicks and conversions, but you pass over much more important information.
With tracking software, you get valuable insights on your leads — where they came from, what time of the day, the ROI they bring, and much more. Besides, the chances are high that you would expand your Christmas ad campaign among more than one or even two traffic sources, and you would want to track the performance of each one. You could do this through multiple affiliate links, but in turn, it would take most of the time you might have rather spent on the optimization of your ads. Using a marketing tracking software like RedTrack.io would allow you to track every aspect of your ad campaigns, and at the same time, automate the execution of some tasks.


Day 6: Testing
Today is the day of testing the results of your intense 5-day-preparation-campaign. The sooner you can start testing creatives, ad messages and setting combinations, the sooner you can make the adjustments necessary to improve your results and increase the ROI.
Again, tracking software is your tool to understand the performance of your ad campaigns across various traffic sources, landers, and offers.
Note: Christmas campaign is by nature a short-term one. So don’t delay on testing, as you might rich the time when the holidays are over and the learning are no longer applicable.


Day 7: Optimization
Don’t you actually think that it’s time for the rest? Definitely not during the busiest month of the year. Once you have finished testing, it’s the high time for you to uncover some pain points and optimize them.
Working hard on the optimization of your ad campaigns performance will ensure that you get the most for your marketing spend.
With the coming Smartlinks feature by RedTrack.io, the detection of profitable combinations becomes automatic. SmartLinks employ the power of the AI and machine learning to substitute manual testing. It means that an advertiser shouldn’t test each link manually anymore to find best performing variables. The algorithms automatically detect most profitable combinations and show each specific user an offer that is most likely to bring conversion.

843,What Makes a Successful Affiliate Marketer,"Affiliate marketing allows people to make extra money by spending some extra time. Like with many other crafts — the more time you invest — the more money you make. Affiliate marketing offers massive potential only to those who аrе wіllіng tо рut іn thе hаrd уаrdѕ tо ѕhаrреn their marketing strategies.
However, there are some secrets to increase ROI (as an affiliate marketer you`ll love this term) of your time invested. Rеаd оn, thіѕ аrtісlе wіll ѕеrvе аѕ a guіdе tо thе mаjоr secrets of becoming a ѕuссеѕѕful affiliate marketer.


Secret 1: Love of Research!
Thе kеу tо a gооd аffіlіаtе mаrkеtіng саmраіgn іѕ rеѕеаrсh. Thіѕ саnnоt bе ѕtrеѕѕеd еnоugh. Yоu аѕk аnу ѕuссеѕѕful аffіlіаtе mаrkеtеr whо іѕ mаkіng hundrеdѕ tо thоuѕаndѕ еасh аnd еvеrу dау whаt thе ѕіnglе mоѕt іmроrtаnt thіng thеу dо іѕ, аnd thеу wіll tеll уоu, Rеѕеаrсh!
An аffіlіаtе mаrkеtеr thаt doesn’t tаkе a kееn іntеrеѕt іn mаrkеt rеѕеаrсh and testing wіll pale in comparison to those thаt dо.
To prevent this, start your way to a successful affiliate marketer with the analyzing phase.

Find a Niche
It is both one of the most problematic and most important steps of your research strategy. But how do you really “find your niche”?
You should take into account at least two aspects: the popularity of a niche and your personal preferences. Why is it important to choose the niche that you like and which is probably rеlаtеd tо уоur hоbbу? Chances are, that this is the niche where you have the biggest expertise, thus, are more likely to create trustworthy and competitive ad content.
Besides, there always have been and always will be the best niches for affiliate marketing. So what are these niches?
• Problem-based niches are profitable. Find the problem, whether it will be acne, loss of weight, leaking roofs, etc, and offer/advertise the solution.
• Health &amp; fitness. The popularity of this niche largely issues from the above-mentioned one. Diet and nutrition, stop-smoking treatments, stress relief, anti-aging, beauty products, etc offer the solutions to age-old people needs.
• Dating. People spend billions of dollars each year in the dating and relationship niche. Just remember how many dating sites there are on the web.
• Gaming &amp; gambling. The volume of this niche has increased again in 2017 with the entrance of Virtual Reality (mobile games, casinos, etc.) and Bitcoin bookmakers. The appealing thing about the game industry is the devoted players that always come back for something more.

Audience Research
Once you’ve decided on the рrоduсt/ ѕеrvісе уоu wаnt tо рrоmоtе, іt’ѕ сruсіаl thаt уоu undеrѕtаnd whо уоur аudіеnсе іѕ, аnd gеt tо knоw thеіr wаntѕ аnd nееdѕ. Fіnd оut whаt trоublеѕ they mау bе еnсоuntеrіng then lооk fоr wауѕ tо ѕоlvе thеm.

Competitors’ Research
Successful аffіlіаtе mаrkеtіng іnvоlvеѕ mоrе than іdеntіfуіng аn audience, уоu аlѕо hаvе tо mаkе a rеѕеаrсh on your соmреtіtоrѕ. Yоu nееd еvеrу аdvаntаgе уоu саn gеt.
Do at lеаѕt ѕоmе соmреtіtіvе аnаlуѕіѕ so уоu саn іdеntіfу the traffic sources, keywords, creatives, etc. that others are using in your niche. The aim should be not to copy your competitor’s ideas and try to make money with it (you would probably fail to do it), but to find the winning and losing combinations.


Secret 2: Fitting Traffic Sources
Thе іmроrtаnсе оf drіvіng hіghlу tаrgеtеd trаffіс саnnоt bе еmрhаѕіzеd еnоugh. Whіlе there аrе a numbеr оf wауѕ tо drіvе trаffіс tо уоur аffіlіаtе mаrkеtіng buѕіnеѕѕ, you should understand that not all sources are equally friendly to different niches.
For example, thе social nеtwоrk уоu use fоr mаrkеtіng саmраіgnѕ ѕhоuld fit уоur audience аѕ wеll аѕ уоur nісhе оffеrіng. Fоr іnѕtаnсе, Facebook is a good source while promoting some gaming niche with CPA campaigns, whereas for dating and adult-related niche, Facebook is not a good match.
What are some good alternatives to Facebook ads? Youtube, Pinterest, Instagram (that has even higher CR and more engagement than Facebook), Twitter. Tаkе thе tіmе tо сrеаtе thе blеnd оf social mеdіа сhаnnеlѕ thаt рrоvіdе the hіghеr return оn уоur еffоrtѕ.
The same social traffic, Facebook, or search engine Google, for example, evidence a huge revenue increase from mobile advertising in 2017. Mobile traffic has become not just a trend in affiliate marketing. It is a must-have.
Within mobile, the most popular forms of advertising are:
• display/banners;
• pop-unders;
• redirects;
• push-notifications.
Make sure you separate desktop ad campaigns from mobile ones. The received traffic from these sources performs differently.


Secret 3: Provide quality Ad Content
Hаvіng dоnе a рrореr rеѕеаrсh оn уоur niche аnd trаffіс ѕоurсеѕ, thе nеxt thіng іn lіnе іѕ tо рrераrе a quаlіtу аnd frеѕh ad соntеnt.
You should approach this step on the part of technical and creative abilities. When designing an ad you should always bear in mind their dimensions (whether it is mobile, desktop, or both, for example), the format (.jpeg, .png, .gif?), the concept — all this influence on how pro and clean your ad looks like.
In case you’re working with multiple offers from one niche, you’d rather consider creating pre-landers. What’s great about them is that a pre-lander can be linked from different sources, e.g. banners, text links, blog, etc. Pre-landers are a great decision for the affiliate marketers who opt for PPC ads and popups.

854,How to Earn Money with Sweepstakes Offers?,"If you’re reading this blog post, you should be either an online merchant or going to become the one. Nevertheless, it is not the issue if you’re an advanced affiliate or a newbie, as sweepstakes are the offers of particular interest for both of you in 2018.
First off, let’s clear up what sweepstakes campaigns are.
Sweepstakes are prize giveaways where the winner (or several winners) is chosen by luck. In order to participate in sweepstakes, the entrants just need to insert their email, name, or some other info. The most popular prices are Apple products. Second place goes to shopping gift cards (example below). Third would probably be taken by the traveling offers.

Once a user completes a sign-up process, the affiliate gets a conversion. The user doesn’t pay for participation, while you’re getting paid by your network / advertiser for every sign-up.
Sounds extremely easy, doesn’t it? Then do sweepstakes offers work at all, or is it simply another campaign strategy individuals rave about with no reason?
Usually, sweeps are really easy to convert. That’s why they present a huge interest for those who just start with paid traffic.
Since sweepstakes require the user only to insert some data, the conversion rate is really high. But does every user become a customer? No way. Hence it appears that the payout is often low.
Other sweepstakes offers, instead, require not just an email insert, but, for example, a subscription. Such offers are harder to convert, they bring higher value to the advertisers, and as a result, lead to a higher payout.
The big popularity of sweepstakes campaigns means they are not just buzzwords, but they still work very well, creating yet higher and higher competition.
So how do you intend to run a successful sweepstakes campaign? Lеt’ѕ gеt ѕtаrtеd with a couple of indispensable steps and tips.

Choose the type of sweepstakes
First thing first, be strategic about the type of sweeps you’re going to run. Since they, in turn, influence the GEOs available, possible audience reach, etc.
One of the methods to ensure a successful sweepstakes campaign is to associate it with something that your target audience is already thinking about.
For example, the recent buzz around iPhone X release. Why not leverage it and receive a high reach? Otherwise, adjust your sweeps with a holiday or special season event.
This can be as simple as “Back-to-school season is coming! Enter now and win a one-year supply of school essentials awarded as a $3,000 check.”
It goes without saying that your sweeps shouldn’t necessarily correlate to a specific event. You can rather create giveaway-sale sweeps, focusing not on a theme, but on a great prize.

Decide on the traffic source and GEO
The most promising combination here is sweeps on the popunder traffic source.
Despite the idea that popads often disturb users, they actually demonstrate high CR, sometimes reaching up to 300%+ boost in ROI.
The internet is also stuffed with dozens of winning cases of sweepstakes campaigns on Facebook traffic source. We, instead, would not advice doing this, since Facebook for years suffered from the influx of sweeps on its social network, and now it has become really strict about this vertical, all the way to banned accounts.
As we’ve already mentioned, the beginners often jump in sweepstakes campaigns as they’re really easy to convert. Still, lacking some prior experience they frequently make mistake by targeting not the right GEO. Looking for higher payouts many aims at 1st tier. Actually, this GEO is defiantly not for newbies, as it’s very competitive and will burn their budget at an early stage. Actually, it’s relevant to all verticals, if you are getting into a new offer, don’t start with 1st tier GEO.
We’d rather recommend choosing several different GEOs in 2nd and 3rd tiers, test them and detect the one that has brought you the most money during the test.
Why choose these tiers?
• traffic is abundant here and cheap;
• less strict legislation on your online activity;
• good starting ground for testing and gaining experience;
• mobile traffic performs really well with popads. While mobile popunders are easier to monetize in tier 2 and tier 3.

Create pre-landers
Just by nature, sweepstakes offers don’t work with direct-linking. They, instead, often require pre-landers, which, in turn, are used in order to make the user more engaged with the possibility of winning a prize.
What should you know while creating a converting pre-lander?
• your call-to-action should be clear and explicit. Make sure it’s obvious how the users should enter the sweepstakes;
• the visual appeal of your pre-lander stands by 70% of how successful your sweepstakes campaign is. The user will not stop by the pre-lander which is plain and doesn’t evoke interest;
• there is a direct relation between the conversion rate and the loading time of your pre-lander. The longer it takes to load, the lower the CR will be;
• optimize the pre-landers for different languages depending on the GEOs you’ve chosen. The pre-landers with the languages native to the GEO you’re targeting tend to perform better than just those that rely on the international English language.
• pre-lander on mobile claims even faster load time. The mobile users are even more impatient about the loading time. Make sure your pre-lander is loaded less than in 1 second.
• experiment with a countdown timer on your pre-lander. Its aim is to encourage people to enter now rather than postpone it.

Test and optimize the sweepstakes campaigns
Create several pre-landers, try different GEOs, experiment with traffic sources, then collect the data on the performance of these variables, and finally stop on the best-performing one(s).
How much testing does it require? It actually shouldn’t take long. It might take you three days to make a proper testing. After that, blacklist non-working sources and variables, and choose those that perform best or have the potential to perform better. Once you black-listed all the unnecessary, split-test on the rest for 5–7 more days (well, it’s approximately) to get dipper in numbers.

975,Answered: Your Most Burning Questions About How to Get Traffic,"This article was originally published in Affbank Blog. The original version can be viewed here.

There has been a lot of talks lately about Google ad ban and Facebook news feed change. This news has shattered some publishers and affiliates, and not without reason. Traffic sources constantly propose new restrictions and regulations, while affiliates should find angles to address them and get around restrictions. Affiliate Marketing is an extremely dynamic industry.

The good thing about traffic sources though: if one isn’t working for you, you always have other options to choose from.

The following Q&amp;A session was organized by RedTrack.io - affiliate campaign tracking solution together with Go2mobi DSP, PopCash PopUnder Network, and Zorka.Network - CPI/ CPA Affiliate Network in order to discuss the factors that change affiliate industry and detect the new ways how to leverage new traffic possibilities.

- What should affiliates consider when choosing a traffic source?



    

Breanne Cozzolino, Sales Director in Go2mobi:
You, as an affiliate might want to evaluate a source’s ease of use, speed of compliance, traffic volume and diversity of publishers. Also, don’t forget to take note of service levels - look for support that is quick and helpful. Optimization is also a very important consideration when selecting a mobile traffic source. Finding a pocket of high-performing traffic is only a good thing if you can isolate it and scale it.



&nbsp;





Ilarion Ispas, COO in PopCash:
My first piece of advice would be to stay away from the new networks, i.e. traffic sources, which pretend to have lots of years of experience when they actually just launched their website. Most likely you will end up buying very, very bad traffic with them, which won’t give you any good.
Secondly, I would advice always searching for direct traffic. Keep in mind that the traffic coming directly from the visitor has better conversion rates than the one which is being redirected and passed through several systems.



&nbsp;





Katya Temchenko, Senior Affiliate Manager in Zorka.Network:
First of all, affiliates should consider their experience in working with different traffic sources. If you are expected to provide quality, don’t risk to drive traffic to the offers from the traffic source you’ve never worked with. Then estimate the KPI and analyze what traffic source you can use to reach KPI goals and satisfy the advertiser’s needs. Furthermore, you should consider the ad pricing model, the ad format, targeting opportunities, systems, budgets, how direct the traffic is and if it matches the product. 



&nbsp;
- What types, formats work well? Which are declining?
Breanne Cozzolino, Go2mobi:
I would recommend trying out native ads as they’re super hot right now, particularly mobile native ads, which are outperforming standard display ads in many metrics. Video is another highly effective ad format.
Static display banners, in turn, have been on the decline the past few years, and are being replaced by more engaging formats like native and video.

Ilarion Ispas, PopCash:
It’s a tough question. And depends mostly on the offers which are going to be launched. Nevertheless, I’m sure everyone is aware of the banner blindness effect and how intrusive the popups can become. These are aspects which can determine a major negative impact for your performances. This is where the popunders shine by having something which other ads lacks, increasing chances of generating a lead.

Katya Temchenko, Zorka.Network:
According to the experience, the native ads always work well for gaming vertical. They’re informative, fill much place on the screen and you can display enough information there to attract a user. Though everything depends on the offer and traffic source. The apps can be advertised using fullscreen ads formats, banners or video ads, especially if we’re talking about in-app traffic. The games can be promoted using native ads, fullscreen ads. The subscriptions - only by fullscreen ads.Nutra offers require long reads. Nevertheless, that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t try other formats, e.g. you can advertise games using narrow banners and reach the required goals. Most of the result depends on the creative quality rather than on the ads format.
- What would you advise to new affiliates?
Breanne Cozzolino, Go2mobi:
To begin, make sure that you’re using the resources available to you: ask your affiliate network representative for top-converting offers, and invest time in seeking out and using competitive intelligence tools.

Ilarion Ispas, PopCash:
First of all, choosing between two most popular pricing models CPA and CPM, we’d recommend to start on CPM due to lower prices. When your campaign starts to demonstrate a stable performance behavior, it can be switched on CPA. Also, do not underestimate targeting features: country targeting, operating system, device types, connection type, mobile carrier, browser and categories. The more you’d use, the better! Besides, I would recommend to separate mobile and desktop traffic, as they convert differently. Thus, should be optimized in different ways too.

Katya Temchenko, Zorka.Network:
We keep holding to a stand that the affiliate job requires a lot of testing and learning new information constantly. You should be ready to great spends but don’t be afraid of that. Think long-term, try new things, stay always updated with the trends, or even a step ahead. You can repeat someone’s success, but in that case you have no chance to become super rich. The only way to your success is creating new approaches and keep to your own strategy. Don’t hesitate to ask your manager anything you don’t understand, they are always ready to assist you.
- Considering all of the above - why should affiliates choose you as a traffic source/ affiliate network?

Breanne Cozzolino, Go2mobi:
Our platform is built for programmatic performance marketers, with highly targeted mobile traffic and high volumes of inventory. Affiliates can access over 750M apps, games and leading mobile websites, and perform deep optimization on signals that lead to maximum ad ROI.
We have a ton of experience in running successful mobile ad campaigns, and our friendly Account Managers are happy to share insights to help affiliates reach their KPIs.

Ilarion Ispas, PopCash:
Established in 2012, PopCash.Net proved to be a reliable source of online ads solution for both advertisers and publishers around the globe. As we accumulated experience by working exclusively with popunders, together we can benefit from the advantages of using these ads and yes, there is plenty of them.
Based on our motto: “Support makes the world go around”, the users will experience a very active customer service support, ready to offer the assistance required and answer to all queries. We want to offer a chance to every person interested in this industry, no matter their experience. 

Katya Temchenko, Zorka.Network:
Some facts: we suggest direct mobile CPA/CPI offers for worldwide traffic, all necessary technical facilities: 5 subID, integration via S2S and API key, and lots of filters for convenient tracking settings. Also we’ve developed an improved smartlink for those who prefer automatic campaigns setup.
Closer to people: affiliates know Zorka.Network for the support team. Our managers are first of all friends to affiliates. We assist affiliates in all issues, create trust-based relationships and maintain individual approach. We have common goals, so we do our best to achieve them by listening attentively to the affiliates, understanding their needs and abilities, trying to find the best offers for their traffic and experience, giving detailed information.

1068,The Secrets of Working with CPI Model,"For app owners, cost per install (CPI) payment model is highly efficient for running campaigns and acquiring new users. Advertisers only pay for the app install, and not for the impressions. However, mastering CPI entails a lot more than learning how to get a maximum number of installs. The secrets of CPI model are all about acquiring quality audience, which actively engages with the app and makes purchases. Advertisers that approach CPI marketing with this mindset are much more likely to achieve success. 
Choosing ad platform 
Advertisers can launch CPI campaigns on various platforms. In terms of managing and controlling campaigns, there are basically two options: self-serve and managed services. There is no “right” selection, and advertisers should choose the solution that better fits their current goals. Self-serve platforms let media buyers, advertisers and app developers start campaigns without the help of the manager — completely on their own. 
Usually, the platforms have a range of tools to help marketers with the launch and optimization of campaigns. These include blacklists and whitelists to filter traffic sources and concentrate on the ones that generate more profit. Clickky’s Self-Serve Platform for Advertisers also offers the price recommendation tool — a handy instrument for learning the current optimal price for one install in the chosen market. The platform gathers and analyzes CPI rates across thousands of campaigns to give advertisers a solid understanding of average pricing in real time, and help them pay the right amount. Self-serve platform works great for those, who know their product and audience well. There are no superfluous costs for running ad campaigns. All the tools for launching and customizing mobile ads are gathered in one place. 
Managed services, on the other hand, rely on the manager’s expertise. Advertisers don’t have to go into the details of their campaign: managers come up with the audience segmentation, choose traffic sources, supervise creatives, test and launch the campaigns. Advertisers set KPIs to indicate the results they wish to achieve and managers take care of the strategy and tactics for ensuring those results.  
This option is usually more convenient for clients that wish to allocate bigger budgets to advertising. It’s also less time-consuming for advertisers and app owners. Usually, managers have a lot of experience of running ad campaigns in various verticals, in different markets and on both big and small budgets. This gives them a perspective on the strategy for every particular campaign, and more flexibility of choosing tactics for their clients. 
Customization, testing, and launch
Having decided on the platform and the tactics of running campaigns, advertisers should set specific KPIs. This is vitally important for assessing both self-managed campaigns and the success of the managed services. Usually, advertisers promote apps to make them profitable in the future. When revenue is the main goal, advertisers focus on Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) and Average Revenue Per Paying User (ARPPU) metrics. Knowing the revenue that one user can generate, and keeping in mind the conversion rate (CR), advertisers can make assumptions about the number of installs they need to earn a designated amount of money. 
For advertisers, it is vital to choose the message for the right audience segments at the right time. For experienced marketers, determining optimization criteria is easy. But for app developers who want to expand their reach, it is better to test their assumptions before scheduling a full-scale campaign. This can be done via Facebook. The platform allows setting limited budgets and offers the access to a versatile audience. After seeing the first results and the response the audience has for the campaigns, it’s time to move to the ad platform, which can ensure better outreach, provide install-focused campaigns and performance tracking.  
Campaign customization includes choosing geolocations, where to promote the app, the type of device (smartphones or tablets) and the type of traffic (either incentive or non-incentive). Advertisers should think about campaign caps, both daily and total, to be sure that they get the amount and quality of installs that they need. 
Tracking and optimization 
One of the most important aspects of running ad campaigns is tracking and analyzing the results. First thing advertisers should think about is installing a tracking URL, to be sure that every install is properly attributed and counted. Thanks to the tracking link, advertisers can work with a tracking solution and follow the campaign closely as it unfolds. 
How can advertisers optimize their mobile ad campaigns with the help of RedTrack.io? 
• check multiple traffic attributes for each click: OS, browser type and version, connection type, device, IP address, click date and time, etc., and easily identify best (and worse) traffic segments; 
• detect the quality of traffic and filter out unwanted bot traffic;
• A/B test various messages, landers, creatives that lead to app installs and detect most profitable ones;
• add several streams with different filters and offers for one ad campaign and control exactly what the user will see when hitting your ad;
• create rules and distribute traffic based on 14 variables and more.
Conclusion
There are no real “secrets” of working with CPI advertising model. Thanks to a range of technological solution available on the market, advertisers, app developers and media buyers can achieve their goals with ease. The ad platforms, both self-serve and managed, provide all the necessary tools for setting up, customizing and launching the campaigns. And the tracking and analytic tools help to understand the results of the campaign and optimize it to earn more revenue in the end.

1210,Top 10 RedTrack Features: May edition,"&nbsp;

May has been a busy month for all the RedTrack.io team. We visited a couple of affiliate conferences in Ukraine, RedTrack Product Manager, Vlad Zhovtenko took the stage at AdSummit Kyiv and provided a deep overview of DSP as a technology; we worked hard on GDPR compliance, and never stopped improving the functionality of the tracker.

As a result, this May we have released quite a few new features and prepared ground for even more updates in June. Keep reading to see Top 10 features we've released in May.

&nbsp;
Campaign report slices/grouping
More data is now available as part of Campaign reports for even more in-depth tracking and analytics. 



Moreover, you are able to group your Campaigns by custom subids, as well as the following parameters:

- Offer
- Landing
- Date
- Date parting
- Connection
- IP
- Device
- OS
- Browser
- Geo
- Referrer
- Sub's

Additionally, you can Export your extended Campaign Report as .csv file.
Cost Models
Upon creating a Campaign, you are able to choose the cost model used by your Traffic Source to enable the most accurate tracking.



RedTrack now supports the following cost models:

 	CPC - cost per click - net cost of a click brought from a Traffic Source. 
 	CPA - cost per action (acquisition) - a fee for a certain action (form submission, registration, download, install etc).
 	RevShare - revenue share - a set % of commission fee paid upon conversion.

&nbsp;

Note: For Offer Payout value to be tracked correctly, make sure that RevShare value in Postback isn't set to ""0"".

RevShare ""0%"" will pass 0 as {offer_payout} value for all campaign types. Please, adjust accordingly.

&nbsp;
Custom Postback Domain
By default, your Postback links contain RedTrack default service domain rdtrck2.com. You can now change it manually to your custom tracking domain and/or select default from the Tools --&gt; Conversion Tracking tab.



Your changes will be automatically applied to new Postbacks upon creating an Offer.

&nbsp;
LP Data
Thanks to LP Views/LP Clicks columns you can now track the performance of your Landing pages straight from Campaign reports. Make sure to submit your Landing pages in ""Landers"" tab and choose the appropriate Lander from the drop-down menu upon creating a Campaign.




&nbsp;
HTTPS Tracking Links

Many platforms require you to submit links in HTTPS format only. RedTrack allows you to choose which type of link will be generated for your Campaign. In order to switch to HTTPS, navigate the Domains tab and toggle the ""Enable HTTPS"" switch. Enter your Certificate and Privatekey and click Save.


Note: You have the ability to switch the format used for your Campaign URL. Just choose the type you prefer from the drop-down list upon creating a Campaign.


&nbsp;
Multiple Offers from one Landing Page
If you wish to use a Landing page that contains links to multiple Offers with a separate button each, make sure that you add different tracking links for each Offer accordingly. 

Use this link structure if you want to link multiple offers simultaneously. Please make sure that the number of offers in a Stream is equal to a number of Multi-offer click URLs in a Landing page.

Offer Link Template:

http://your_tracking_domain.com/click/1

&nbsp;

1936,All You Need to Know about HTTPS and RedTrack,"Starting on July 1st, 2018, Google Chrome will mark all HTTP sites (i.a. Landing Pages) as “not secure” — stats Chrome security product manager in their official blog. 
The image below shows what the address bar will look like for your site next July:

The upcoming policy change might greatly affect your ad campaigns for the worse. To avoid possible risks, we strongly recommend you to use HTTPS encryption for your Landing Pages.

1937,RedTrack Feature: Impression Tracking,"We, at RedTrack.io are primarily interested in two things: providing you with an unchallenged tracking experience and giving you a comprehensive control over all the trackable metrics. 
We are glad to announce that now, RedTrack not only provides tracking of clicks and conversions but ad impression tracking as well. When used with other tracking metrics, impressions give you a vital overview of your ad campaign performance, like where you have more impressions and fewer click-throughs, or vice versa. 

What is impression tracking?
Impression is the number of times a banner ad is viewed. It is a non-action-based metric that is used to track the first interaction of a user with an ad. 
Impression tracking is a powerful metric. Use it to measure the difference between the number of opportunities a user might click on the ad, and the actual quantity of clicks. 
When tracking the impression, your campaign reports will have far more clarity. Control bigger amounts of data and have a complete view of the total effectiveness of your ad campaigns. 

How to use impression tracking in RedTrack?
To track impressions in RedTrack, you need to make several easy steps:
1. Go to the Traffic Sources tab. Use either the Source from the list of pre-sets or create a new one.
2. Navigate to the impression tracking attributes.


Insert the corresponding macros of the Traffic Source of your choice, where: 
Imp Ref ID — traffic source macro for imp_id. Important if you plan to postback impressions to the source.
Impression Cost ID — traffic source macro for impressions cost. Important if you want to get individual cost data for each impression. 
Note: Make sure, the Traffic Source of your choice supports impression tracking.
3. Click the Save button. Along with click tracking, you have now enabled the impression tracking for the Traffic Source entity in RedTrack. 
4. Set up your campaign in RedTrack. To do so, go to the Campaigns tab. Enter all the obligatory entities and choose the Traffic Source, where you have activated the impression tracking option. Save the campaign. RedTrack will generate two tracker URLs: one for click-based attribution, another — for impression tracking.

Copy both links and insert them on the Traffic Source side.
With impression tracking option, you might use a CPM cost model in campaign settings. If Imp Ref ID and Imp Cost ID macros set right, you now receive an accurate information on the number of actual impressions made and the cost of each individual impression —&gt; super precise CPM tracking.
Note: With RedTrack, you can not only get an insight about the number of impressions and their cost, but also postback all this and other information to the network. With the growth of requirements towards transparency in advertising, this option would be of particular interest to both affiliates and advertisers. 
View impression data within the reports
RedTrack captures all the values populated by each macro, used by your Traffic Source. This data is collected and generated for your tracking reports. 
With impression statistics, receive more information about the traffic you buy and run straight into your RedTrack account. Use this information further, and optimize your ad campaigns at the level of both clicks and impressions! 

Stay Tuned!
Right now, we’re working on an impressive set of functions that are aimed to provide you with entirely unchallenged and efficient tracking experience.

1939,Track with No Redirects,"This question comes up quite often with our users:  
— how do I track organic traffic?  
— can I run campaigns on Google and Facebook without redirects but with all the other benefits of using the tracker? 

Let`s talk about one really important feature RedTrack has — direct traffic tracking, that has quite a mystery name inside our tracker — LP Pixel. 
Why use direct traffic tracking? 
With LP (direct traffic tracking) Pixel, you can now track the events that come both from the paid and organic / direct traffic. In other words, this function allows you to send traffic without redirects, and get all the information like you normally do. 

And of course it is specifically interesting to those who run campaigns on Google AdWords and Facebook. Thess sources “love” banning for redirects, but with LP Pixel there is nothing to worry about. 
How track direct traffic with RedTrack.io? 
First thing to mention is that at RedTrack, LP Pixel is generated each time you create and save a Campaign. So apparently to generate your pixel, go to Campaign tab and create a new one. 



Once you save a Campaign, the LP Pixel is automatically generated. The direct traffic tracking pixel consists of the tracking URL itself and the macros with additional parameters that you’ve specified in advance. 

E.g.: &lt;img src=“http://rdtrck2.com/5b33a3fe2c822c0001c891a8?ref_id={click_id}&amp;sub1={campaign}&amp;sub2={zone}&amp;sub3={country}&amp;sub4?format=img” height=""1"" width=""1"" /&gt;     

Copy the generated link and add it within the &lt;body&gt; section of your landing page. 

Once done, every visitor to this landing page will be attributed to the campaign you took LP pixel from. With LP Pixel by RedTrack, you can get the same comprehensive overview of your traffic as you receive for the redirect tracking method, when the tracking URL is used. 

Note! We would advise you to create a dedicated Campaign to track the organic traffic. Basically, you would have two types of Campaigns for the same funnel: one for tracking direct traffic, and the other one (or more) for redirect traffic. This will make A/B split testing even more clean and transparent. 

Use LP Pixel by RedTrack, track Google, Yandex, Facebook, MyTarget Ads, and other sources including organic traffic with no redirects and eliminate the risk of being “unloved” and banned. 

We know video speaks louder than words, so check our guide about direct traffic tracking, and learn everything about running and analyzing ad campaigns with no redirects with the help of RedTrack:

Have questions regarding direct traffic tracking? Just contact our team emailing to support@redtrack.io or let’s discuss the tracking with no redirects in RedTrack Telegram Community.

1941,July'18 Product Update - RedTrack.io,"This first day of August we're happy to announce a brand new set of features released in July. Don't miss a single one of them, as they are assigned to not just increase the efficiency of your work, but they open just a new range of tracking opportunities for RedTrack users.

Let's dive into the details!
Campaign cost update
This feature would be of particular interest to those who work with the CPM cost model. As you can now update Campaign costs in just a few clicks right from RedTrack interface. Access the function directly from the Campaigns Dashboard:


Or, alternatively, from the Campaign creation/edit window. Updates can occur as often as every five minutes.

&nbsp;
SubID alias
SubIDs not only provide you with additional information about your Traffic Source, they also give extra insight into your Traffic when you use filters or group your reports by a certain parameter. To make the utilization of subIDs easier for you, we are introducing subID alias — the ability to assign custom names to subIDs for future reference.

To set a custom name for any of subIDs go to create/ edit field of Traffic Source tab, and set a desired name in the Parameter column.

&nbsp;
Free SSL certificates 
As you probably know, Google marks all HTTP Landing Pages as ""not secure"" since July 1st, 2018.

To make sure that none of your Campaigns are jeopardized due to the link format, we strongly recommend you to use HTTPS encryption for your Landing Pages.

Good news is, RedTrack now makes it possible without any additional expenses! Every customer who is subscribed to Professional plan and above can reach out to us and have their SSL certificate issued for free.

UPD: We now stopped the free issue of SSL certificates. If you have questions, please send them to support@redtrack.io.

&nbsp;
HTTPS tracking links for default domain
Sometimes your Network requires you to use tracking URL in HTTPS format only. From now on, you may adjust your links even if you use our default tracking domain, which is https://rdtrck2.com.

This feature may be enabled in Campaign creation/edit window using the Protocol button.

&nbsp;
Transaction tracking

2065,Tracking Multiple Conversions Per One ClickID,"At the core of affiliate and performance marketing, the desired result of any ad campaign is a completed action, or in other words — conversion. Whether the conversion action is app download or purchasing, this event defines how you would optimize your ad campaign further. It sounds pretty straightforward. But what happens if you have multiple events that define conversion? 

Here are just a few funnels when it makes sense to track multiple conversion events. 
— CPI offers, i.e. when an advertiser pays not for an app download, but for a particular action inside the app.
E.g:  primary conversion — app download,
the secondary conversion step — 3rd level completeness.
— Ecommerce, i.e. when you’re interested in tracking multiple website purchases, in other words, several “add to cart” actions.
— CPL offers, i.e. when an advertiser pays you for a lead (where lead is any contact information left by a buyer).
E.g:  primary conversion — signing up for smth on the website,
the 2nd conversion step — lead, i.e. subscription and leaving contact information for some further promo offers.
It follows that tracking multiple conversion events is not just an option to get extra data point, but also a must-have for many affiliates who work with offers with complex purchase funnels.   

With this in mind, we’ve introduced transaction tracking option to RedTrack users.

&nbsp;
What is transaction tracking and how to use it in RedTrack?
As it follows from the above, the transaction tracking function in RedTrack is used when you wish to record a secondary conversion step per visitor after they perform the primary conversion action.

The transaction tracking in RedTrack is done with the additional &amp;type=transaction parameter. And can be performed within:

S2S postback URL  tracking: 


Or, pixel-based tracking: 


Find the template of transaction tracking Postback URL / Pixel in the Tools tab —&gt; Tools —&gt; Conversion tracking of your RedTrack account interface. 

To track second conversion (= transaction) pass the transaction tracking postback URL (from the above) into the Network you use in addition to your regular tracking URL.

Important: In order to track multiple target actions on one offer, you should make sure that the Network supports multiple postbacks. 

&nbsp;

When transaction tracking yet comes into play? 

There are quite a lot of cases when webmasters and online marketers, who use RedTrack have contact forms or surveys on their websites. If they want to track the steps of form filling, they can do it by means of Pixel tracking. Then, use Conversion Pixel postback for the first step of form filling, and the Transaction Pixel postback — for the second step. 

Transactions will be recorded and displayed in all reports separately from conversions. It allows the users to have a deeper insight into the traffic performance and to get more data for further optimization decisions.

2110,Data View Customization: Make Data Analysis Efficient,"Dashboard is the first screen that every user sees when launching a tracker. While working with dozens, hundreds, or thousands of ad campaigns, dashboard with data tables is a place where you can take a quick overview into your ad campaigns’ performance without going into details. 

To make data analysis easy and, what is more important, efficient, a user needs to customize the way they view the data. With this in mind, we introduced data table customization feature to RedTrack users. 
What is Data Table Customization in Tracker? 
Customized tables allow you to build your own tailor-made dashboards from inside the RedTrack interface. Use this feature and create flexible monitoring of ad campaign performance. 

To customize data table you can choose the metrics you want to be displayed/ hidden, or change the order how the metric columns are shown in the interface. 

Find the inverted “hamburger-menu” button  in the upper right corner of the tracker interface. Click it in order to customize the Data table.



Among the metrics that you can add/ hide or re-order within data table customization: 
— Date;
— Impressions;
— Clicks;
— CTR;
— Unique clicks;
— LP views;
— LP clicks (clicks from Lander to Offer);
— Conversions;
— CR;
— Transactions;
— Revenue;
— Cost;
— Profit;
— ROI;
— CPC;
— CPA;
— CPT (cost per transaction);
— EPUC (earning per unique click);
— LP CTR (LP clicks to LP views ratio);
— etc.
RedTrack users can access data table customization feature not only for its main Dashboard tab, but for all the tabs inside the tracker, namely: 
— Campaigns dashboard
— Edit Campaign dashboard
— Offers dashboard
— Landers dashboard
— Domains dashboard
— Networks dashboard
— Traffic Sources dashboard
— Logs (i.e. clicks, conversions, postbacks) dashboards
Use data table customization feature to easily select and position the metrics you want to view and have this data in your own customized table reports.

As an example, let’s take a look at several real-life cases.

Case #1

When a user works with, for example, CPI offers they don’t use landing pages and run traffic directly to the offer. In this case they have no need to monitor all the data related to Landers, i.e.: 
— LP Views;
— LP Clicks;
— LP CTR (LP clicks to LP views ratio)
— LP Views CR (Conversions to LP views ratio)
— LP Clicks CR (Clicks to LP clicks ratio)
In their case their data table might have the following look:

Case #2

The other way around, user’s ad activity largely depends on their landing pages performance. In this case, they might want to see all the metrics regarding the landers’ performance above all else. 



These are just the examples of two extreme cases. Use data table customization feature to extract maximum value from monitoring and analytics within your particular conditions and requirements. 

Should you have any further questions about data table customization or any other RedTrack feature, please contact support@redtrack.io and our team would be happy to assist you. Join our Community on Telegram to stay in tune with all RedTrack updates, news, and giveaways!

2193,How to Convert Popunder Traffic?,"Popunder traffic is the easiest entry point in affiliate marketing world.

How often have you heard that before? We bet quite often. Our RedTrack Team decided to investigate this statement and find out whether this is the case. By the end of this post, you would receive a comprehensive overview of Popunder traffic and how to convert it effectively. Namely, you will know: 
— What is Popunder.
— How Popunder works.
— Tips: how to convert Popunder traffic.
— Super bonus: Interview with PropellerAds, the leading Popunder Ad Network in the world (Besides this ad format, they also focus on native advertising and native push notifications, in particular). Even more actionable tips and pieces of advice await you there!
Let’s dive into Popunder world, and start with the basics.
What is a Popunder ad? 
Popunder ad is a type of a full-size window that opens in the browser just under the main active window. To fully understand this ad format, it’s often opposed to Pop-up ad. In contrast to Popunder ad, Pop-up opens over the browser window.

An aggressive and intrusive approach of Pop-ups has shaped the future of this ad format. It is almost forgotten by now and replaced by Popunder. Since Popunder advertisement appears once the user closes their main browser window, it makes them less intrusive and more acceptable to users. 
How does Popunder ad work?
Popunder is often used not just for attracting traffic (both web and mobile), but for capturing contact information like email, as well. 

Since Popunder runs perfectly on different platforms (desktop, tablet, or mobile), it makes them rather popular as they allow to reach the audience wherever they are. When a user clicks on the Popunder ad they would be either redirected straight to the advertiser’s page with an offer, or directed to a pre-lander first. 

Note: there is no the only right answer — should you convert Popunder traffic via redirect to advertiser’s page or by means of the pre-lander. The best solution would be to split-test both scenarios and decide on the winning solution. 

Two most popular pricing models for Popunder traffic are CPM and CPA. Still, other models, like CPI (cost per install) and CPL (cost per lead) are available with this traffic type as well.

Popunder is quite a popular ad format among both newbies, and some expert affiliates, who from time to time shift to this traffic type to promote particular product types. Among best-performing verticals are coupons, pin submits, gambling, adult and dating, nutra.
Some tips while working with Popunder traffic:
• split ad campaigns by GEO. Every geography has certain best time which brings “best” conversions. Thus, you’d better pay attention to this variable while scheduling the ad campaign;
• split-test direct to the offer / lander redirect advertising;
• use caps. Don’t annoy the user with one and the same pop ad over and over again throughout the day. Set unique visitor cap and display alternative ad to every unique user. Set the limit of unique visits depending on the audience size;

• work side-by-side with a tracker. No, seriously! Don’t cut anything (lander, geo, timeframes, etc.) without drilling down into data;
• consider testing different landers from the very start. You would be surprised what a huge impact a lander might have when working with Popunder. Consider using a spy tool to know the trends;
Ready to start with Popunder traffic? I bet you want even more actionable tips at this stage. 

We asked Andrey Veselov, Sales Team Lead from PropellerAds, a few questions about Popunder trends in general and how to convert this traffic effectively. With no further delay, let’s dive into secrets and tips of Popunder. 

1. Question: Quite a while ago, Popunder once and forever shifted Pop-up traffic. Since then it is considered to be one of the top ad formats. What are the reasons for such success?

Answer: Despite the popular belief, Popunder is not an aggressive ad format – compare it to Popups, and you’ll have an idea of what kind of difference it made when first hit the market.

Popunder is, in fact, all about users and their free choice, because an ad doesn’t block the website content and doesn’t force users to click – it’s pretty easy to close.

Unraveling the secret of Popunder’s success, I can tell that it’s kind of an ad solution that makes the entire advertising ecosystem profitable. Webmasters are the main Popunder devotees – you can see this ad format on the majority of the biggest websites: it allows publishers to maintain the balance between the high profits and the positive user experience.

And advertisers are getting conversions at low cost while creating immense brand awareness. It’s plain to see that Popunder is a fantastically versatile instrument, capable of handling a wide variety of tasks. Moreover, it’s extremely easy to use.

Altogether these factors help Popunder preserve its place as one of the top ad formats.

2. Question: What future do you see for Popunder traffic?

Answer: The future looks bright for Popunder. PropellerAds is the biggest provider of pop traffic worldwide with the enormous user database. The format also continues to evolve, now there are even more advanced opportunities to reach a target user.

Recently, we’ve launched a unique targeting option – User Activity targeting. I can see that it seriously expanded advertisers’ toolkit, contributing to a higher CTR. We have great feedback from our clients.

Apart from creating new features, we have been seriously researching the format with the final goal to understand what combinations of tools are leading to the best results. We ended up developing our own strategy: precise settings plus retargeting. You can read about it here.

Not just technology changes, we can see that now Popunder attracts bigger brands that use Popunder as a part of their marketing funnel. So, the trend is obvious, key players are already here. I believe this process was triggered by the recent Google’s policy changes and intensified fight with misleading advertising.

The perception of the format has shifted considerably, and the whole market will most likely benefit from this change.

3. Question: What pricing model do you recommend — CPA or CPM while working with Popunder traffic?

Answer: Pricing model depends on the product you promote. For example, CPM and CPC give better testing opportunities, you can actually gauge the lead quality.

Again, here we have our proprietary solution SmartCPM, and a new addition to our automated tools collection – CPA Goal that works in conjunction with SmartCPM.

As for CPA – it doesn’t work for every product. From my experience, CPA is a better choice if you are eyeing easier conversions or your flow is short.

4. Question: What are the hottest GEOs for Popunder traffic?

Answer: Traditionally, the U.S. is at the top by revenue. The entire Tier-3 is a major destination for testing offers, but overall, I can’t name specific GEOs because the popularity of regions and countries is tied to products and offers.

5. Question: Any piece of advice on targeting Popunder traffic?

Answer: Always start with analyzing your product/offer. Once you are done with basic targeting settings, set up the User Activity targeting. If it’s a new product or you are testing completely fresh creatives – do begin with “High” activity group. These users are the most engaged ones.

After that, see the campaign results and amount of leads generated. Worked well? Scale the campaign to other activity groups to expand the reach.

6. Question: Since you see the data in your network, are there verticals that perform best with Popunder traffic now? Or maybe, which offers should not be promoted with this traffic at any cost?

Answer: From my experience, B2B offers don’t really perform on Popunder, other than that, this ad format works perfectly for the most verticals: betting, sweepstakes, finance, gambling, software and all kind of entertainment products.

7. Question: Would you suggest Popunder traffic for newbies?

Answer: Well, Popunder is an incredibly easy format. Normally, newbies don’t face any problems while launching Popunder campaigns.

8. Question: What budget size is enough for testing new campaign?

Answer: To define the testing budget, you should look at the popularity of the offer. If there are lots of similar offers in the market and the competition is high, you would need a higher testing budget.

If the offer is exclusive, you can go for a lower budget.

The testing amount would also depend on the vertical. The general recommendation for sweepstakes and software is to start with $100 – you can understand whether the campaign is getting enough traffic and if you are happy with the lead quality.

If your conversion flow is somewhat complicated (a user is required to perform multiple actions), you will need to increase the testing budget to $500, because you have to test more zones to understand where your leads are.

9. Question: Let’s think of a practical scenario: let’s say I’m a newbie affiliate and I want to start with Popunder traffic. Which vertical should I choose? Should I start with low or high bid? Do I need lander or run traffic directly to the offer? How much time should I spend on a/b testing? Maybe something I should stay away from as a total newbie in here?

Answer: I can’t recommend you a particular vertical, mainly because I strongly believe you should be passionate about what you promote and be initially interested in the vertical.

Conduct your own research, talk to other affiliates, go through forums to form an opinion on what’s hot now.

As for the bids, from my standpoint, it’s more practical to test campaigns with higher bids. Got the results – reduce the bid and scale your campaign. Very often good campaigns with perspective creatives fail due to a lean budget.

Have doubts? Contact your account manager or Support team via live chat to scout out the situation. We have a strong team with years of experience, who can give you viable advice on how to better launch your ad campaign.

Let’s talk about pre-landers. It’s a debatable topic. Some offers require pre-landers, while using pre-lander for betting or software offers might kill conversion. I recommend you to check our blog post, where we discussed all the pros and cons.

All in all, with PropellerAds you have nothing to be afraid of. We are rolling out a totally new anti-fraud system, we have very qualified support and friendly account managers.

Thanks for the answers, Andrey!

2272,Google Parallel Tracking Panic,"Starting October 30, 2018, parallel tracking will be required for all Google Ads accounts. 

Due to timeliness and importance of this topic, RedTrack users and all the affiliates and digital marketers engaged in online advertising are seeking to learn more about Google’s new parallel tracking and how it will influence their “tracking habits”. 

We summed up everything you need to know about parallel tracking and how to prepare for the change on October 30.
What is parallel tracking and how does it work?
Simply put, ‘parallel tracking’ is a term that describes Google’s new way of monitoring clicks. It has come as an alternative to sequential tracking used before. Today both tracking approaches are applicable. However, since October 30, every user and advertiser dealing with Google ads are obliged to switch to parallel tracking. 

Let’s define the difference between Google’s sequential and parallel tracking. 

Sequential tracking flow:



And here’s what parallel tracking looks like: 



Since two actions, i.e. click direction and tracking, happen simultaneously, the term ‘parallel tracking’ occurred. 

Important! With parallel tracking, every URL in the forwarding flow must support the HTTPS protocol. Data tracking will stop at the first URL prefixed with HTTP. This will not prevent the user to reach the landing page since the tracking is performed in the background, but information on clicks will not be registered.

&nbsp;
Why Google requires users to switch to Parallel tracking?
Although the numerous redirects of the sequential tracking flow are completely invisible to the users, they still might slow down landing page load speed. 

Google says: As page load time goes from one second to five seconds, the probability of bounce increases by 90%.

With parallel tracking, once a user clicks your ads, they will be immediately directed to your Lander, while the browser will process the tracking request in the background. These measurements lead to the improvement of lander load time. 

Google is all about better user experience. For the user, parallel tracking means less clunky landing page experience. For the advertisers, — a user is more likely to convert.

&nbsp;
How this change will affect me as a RedTrack user? 
The first thing to tell is that RedTrack is “Parallel tracking ready”.

To enable Google parallel tracking, you should consider the following:
1. Ensure you have switched on the Parallel Tracking in your RedTrack account. Set this option at the level of a Traffic Source → Google Adwords template. 
In order to track and record Google ads click identifier, you should also put the {gclid} parameter in Click Ref ID field.



This options will guarantee that every click on your ad would be tracked with all metrics and attributes. 
2. Set parallel tracking in your Google Adwords account. To turn on this function go to All Campaigns → Settings → Account settings
Note: You should put two links here, where:

Tracking template is the tracking URL that is generated in RedTrack once you save the Campaign.
Final URL is the link of a final page (the lander that a visitor should see).


3. Ensure that the Affiliate Network you are working with is ready to Google parallel tracking. Ask your affiliate manager if you need to change anything in your postback URL or offer URL.
Why is this required? Affiliate Network (Advertiser) contains the final destination of the user direction flow. To receive the information about conversions from them, you use the postback with RedTrack {clickid} macro. Thus, make sure that the Network is ready to parallel tracking and knows how to pass the data on conversion.

Ready to start advertising with Clickadu? 

We asked Demian Mash, Head of Marketing at Clickadu, a few questions about their ad network, and some tips and pieces of advice on how to work with different ad formats. Let’s find the answers!

1Q: Please tell us the history of Clickadu creation and growth. Are there any specific advantages of your ad network?

1A: Clickadu advertising network was founded in 2014 and has grown to a decent player in the Digital Affiliate Market.

Plenty of advantages our partners may like:
 • Traffic from direct publishers
 • A huge variety of verticals for main and adult traffic.
 • Self-Serve platforms for advertisers and publishers
 • Wide selection of advertising formats
 • CPM, CPC and SmartCPA pricing models
 • And careful support. We do love our partners.
2Q: What requirements do you impose on the affiliates who want to join your network?

2A: As a matter of fact, we don’t have any particular requirements for affiliates. We give preference but not limited to publishers with search traffic. At least you need to have around 5K a day to have a good income.

3Q: I know that your main focus is pop traffic. Are you also planning to expand reach over other ad formats?

3A: Our big debut in the digital market was as a popunder network, this year we have expanded to a multi-formatted advertising network with 360 degrees coverage.

Today we can offer you not just popunders, but video, mobile dialog ads, and push notifications and there are more other advertising formats on the way. Just stay with us to be updated.

4Q: In regards to every ad format you work with — which ones could you offer for those who just start their journey in affiliate marketing?

4A: I would recommend you start with pop advertising.

Pop ads the cheapest and requires less efforts to buy traffic. All you need is an attractive landing page and a plenty of traffic to start.

5Q: What minimal start budget you recommend for each ad format?

5A: The initial budget for all advertising formats is $100, this sum is quite enough to figure out whether Clickadu traffic is suitable for offers you selected. Don’t forget to tune your targetings and bid in the process.

6Q: Let’s imagine that I’m a new affiliate, who wants to test pop traffic. Is there any advice or caution that you would give me?

6A: There are a lot of ‘quick buck case studies’ over the net describing aggressive advertising methods, tech-support, and other blackhat stuff. We highly recommend you to refrain from using them even though they look quite promising, it’s more like a huge money loss. Besides, Cliсkadu takes all those violations seriously and we don’t allow this kind of stuff.

7Q: Let’s imagine again — I’m a total noob in bidding. Which approach should I focus first — bid high or low to test the campaign?

7A: We would recommend you to set average, or recommended bid. Use Inventory Planner to choose the appropriate bid or you can always contact your personal manager os support team. We are always glad to help.

8Q: Do you witness any shifting/ trends towards particular advertising formats?

8A: This year quite a lot of advertisers have switched from pop traffic to video and native ads.

We suppose that this trend will be growing up in the future and we do not hesitate to move in this direction.

9Q: Any predictions about mobile and desktop traffic? Maybe you witness the interest among Clickadu users towards particular traffic?

9A: Back in 2016 we have had around 40% mobile traffic of the total. Now, the number is above 65% and eventually continues to grow as well as mobile traffic demand. It’s not a secret that mobile will take the lead over the market. It’s well-targeted and on the move.

Yet, don’t discard desktop traffic. There are plenty of offers that go well with the desktop especially with Clickadu traffic.

10Q: It’s said that 2018 has been a year of botnets. Does Clickadu offer any bot/fraud filtering features?

10A: This year we have moved to a new ad server, refactored all the algorithms including bot and fraud filtering. We’re using our in-house solutions, that check traffic for 36 different matters. The simple of that: no touch, window and screen dimensions, browser and OS versions relevance and a lot more other stuff.

2459,How to Convert Zero Click Traffic?,"The truth is that testing new traffic types is part of the DNA of every affiliate. The reason is a never-ending game for better conversions and higher ROI.

Today we wanna talk about the traffic type that has received a reputation of being highly-targeted and well-converting. RedTrack Team together with our friends and Traffic Source Partner — ActiveRevenue, decided to compile a comprehensive guide to zero-click traffic!

Read the guide to know:
• What zero-click traffic is.
• Factors that influence the success of ad campaigns.
• Tips on how to convert zero-click traffic.
Spoiler: at the end of this blog post you would find a special bonus from our Partner, Active Revenue DSP.
What is zero-click traffic?
Alternative names: Domain Redirect, PPR (pay per redirect) traffic.

Zero-click is a traffic type that comes from visitors who wrongly type a domain in their browser and get redirected to a landing page with an affiliate’s offer on it. The redirect doesn’t require users to click anywhere — that’s where the idea of the name comes from.

Around the affiliate community, zero-click traffic is known as, 
• highly-targeted;
• newbie-friendly;
• easy for testing and optimization;
• highly converting;
It all sounds like a sweet deal. Let’s find out whether this is the case.

Domain Redirect traffic is warm traffic, meaning the offer is displayed to the users who are already actively searching for a product. A lot of zero-click traffic comes from such “mistakes” as typing domain.com instead of domain.org, or such typos as travlworld.com instead of travelworld.com.

Unlike such ad formats as pops or banners, domain redirects usually don’t disrupt the buyer experience. Since it targets the people who are searching for a product that is relevant to the offer you advertise, zero traffic results in high conversion rates and low churn rates. As it follows, you don’t need massive amounts of visits to make money. What you do need is the right targeting, namely the right keywords, and a/b testing.



Ready to test zero-click traffic? We asked Alon Hollander, Network Director at ActiveRevenue, to share some pieces of advice on how to convert zero-click traffic effectively. Keep on reading to find the tips shared with you by the expert.



— First of all, tell us more about your DSP ActiveRevenue. How did it all begin? What specific advantages do you bring to the market?   

ActiveRevenue was founded in 2014 as a part of a huge media group. ActiveRevenue is a Self-serve advertising platform that owns high volumes of traffic from multiple ad formats, and it is a one-stop-shop for all the advertising needs of our clients.

Besides, we provide a dedicated account manager with 24/7 support, user-friendly UI, micro-targeting options, and an automatic optimization tool.

— What ad formats do you focus on now? What are the volumes for each of them?

POP — 300M impressions per day.
Display — 150M impressions per day.
Native — 80M impressions per day.
PPR (zero-click) — 12M impressions per day.
Push — 3.7M clicks per day.

— Zero-click traffic has been around for a while, and many affiliates name it a “newbie-friendly” format. Do you agree with this statement?

I agree with the statement. However, even some veterans in advertising use this traffic type as the only type of traffic they buy for their campaigns, and that means a lot. The main advantage of this format is the ability to target accurate keywords, which in turn allows you to target the exact audience for your campaign.

— What budget size is enough for testing a new campaign?

The testing budget for this traffic ranges from $100 to $500 and depends on the goal of the campaign.

— What future do you predict for zero-click?

I would say, it is an evergreen traffic type, as it targets people who are actively searching for a product relevant to your offer. It results in high conversion potential as the visitors have a genuine intent to convert.

— Since you see data in your network, can you tell us what are the most popular verticals promoted on zero-click traffic?

It can be a good fit for any format because it is keyword-based traffic. We see great results with loans, dating, sweepstakes, and gambling.

— What are the top 5 factors that influence the success of PPR-based ad campaign?

I would say they are the following:
— choosing a wide pull of keywords that are still relevant for your campaign;
— keyword optimization;
— adding negative keywords to the campaign;
— isolating geos (if the campaign is for multiple geos);
— adjusting bids for each keyword based on the performance.
— The success of PPR-based campaigns quite often depends on the lander. Some pieces of advice you want to share when creating a landing page?

Generally, landing page should be created based on the goal of the campaign and the message that you want to pass to the user. Images or videos that provoke emotions will keep the user interested in the offer. For example, a couple walking on a beach while holding their hands will raise the feeling of love for the user.

— Any tips on targeting PPR traffic?

Zero click traffic works amazingly on small niche verticals because you can target specific users. For example, mortgage loans. It might be difficult to allocate users that are looking for a mortgage loan but with well-targeted keywords, you can do it easily.

— Let’s think of a practical scenario: let’s say I’m a newbie affiliate and I want to start with zero-click traffic. Which vertical should I choose? Should I start with a low or high bid? Any tips on how should I choose the keywords? How much time should I spend on a/b testing?

Any vertical will work here but we recommend running offers with high payouts like CPS offers because PPR traffic leads to sales at higher rates compared to other formats. With ActiveRevenue, you will get full support from us to have the best keywords inventory right from the beginning.

The bids vary on how ""narrow"" you are on the keyword targeting, and, of course, the competition affects the price greatly too.

The a/b testing depends rather on how much traffic you buy than the time you need to spend on it. A decent budget for a campaign should be a few hundred of dollars.

2531,What is the difference between Tracking Pixel and S2S Postback URL tracking?,"What kind of conversion tracking method you should use is one of the most important questions that you need to find an answer to. Currently the two biggest tracking protocols out there are Pixel and S2S Postback tracking. Deciding which one to choose can be difficult but there are things that can help you pick the right one!

We've compiled a quick summary and some information about both tracking methods: what's the difference, which one is better, and when.
Tracking Pixel
Tracking Pixel is a tracking method based on fact that every browser temporarily stores information about the user's visit to a website and his activity there. This information is stored in so-called cookies. When conversion happens, cookies are getting reviewed again to authenticate the session of the user and attribute the conversion to the visit. Tracking Pixel can track webpage visits, ad impressions, conversions, and a whole bunch of other metrics.
But what is Tracking Pixel at its core? 
Tracking Pixel is a piece of HTML code that is being placed on your website or landing page to track user activity and conversions. To track conversions of your offers, you need to put Tracking Pixel (HTML code) on the page that follows the sales page. Often it’s called a confirmation or thank you page. When a user visits this page, Tracking Pixel HTML code registers a conversion in RedTrack (if the user came there because of our advertising campaign). 

The great thing about pixels is that they are very easy to set up! Within just a few minutes you can have your pixel up and running and track different kinds of metrics. All you need to do is to copy a chunk of code and paste it into your website! As simple as that!

The tracking pixel can also be used on pretty much all networks (if you have access to the landing page code/constructor), while S2S has to be supported in order to work. Nevertheless tracking pixel it is not a perfect solution to everything. Some websites prevent proper tracking with cookies without full authorization and pixels tend to be not as reliable as S2S Postback URL tracking. This problem will likely get worse with time. Such browsers as Safari and Mozilla already started blocking the storage of web users' data in cookies. The most popular browser - Chrome would release the same update in 2021. All these make the pixel-based method a vulnerable tracking solution.
Then what are the pros and cons of the tracking pixel method?

⇒ pros
– Quick and easy to implement. The setup is very simple and can be used if you need to be fast. Just copy and paste the HTML code to the page that follows the sale confirmation.

– Good for Organic traffic. 

– You can use tracking pixel when your system or your affiliate network does not support S2S Postback URL tracking set-up.
RedTrack is constantly helping to implement S2S Postback tracking even in those cases, when it seems impossible, like in the case of our integration with ClickBank. 
⇒ cons
– Sometimes inaccurate. A tracking pixel is not as reliable as S2S Postback URL tracking. Since all information about the user is stored in his own browser cookies, once they are deleted, there is no tracking. Users can delete cookies (clear their cache) themselves, which happens quite often. Especially for more tech-literate users who know that removing app cache or browser solves crashing, sluggish performance, and other potential problems.

– All browsers are limiting support for it. The web browsers started to prevent unsanctioned tracking with the use of cookies. Mozilla Firefox and Apple Safari have already implemented Intelligent Tracking Prevention, which, in many cases, doesn’t let you spot conversions with third-party cookies. Chrome will update its cookie policy in 2021 as well.

Learn more about the difference between Tracking Pixel and S2S Postback URL in our YouTube video: 


S2S Postback URL
Server-to-Server (S2S) tracking is a more complicated, but better way of tracking information about the user and what he clicked on. This method generates a click ID value via an HTTP request that is used for tracking. Once a conversion happens, the affiliate network sends the value and info to your tracking software, like RedTrack, and gives you detailed information about everything. 

It is a very accurate tracking method and you get a lot more information about the user’s actions. It is also extremely secure and reliable (Pixels can sometimes misfire). 
How does S2S postback tracking look like?

 	A user sees an ad and clicks on it.
 	 With the click, a user goes through several redirects in a blink of an eye. In a few milliseconds, he visits RedTrack (as a tracking solution), Affiliate Network, Advertiser (the offer owner), and a landing page. Now every party has information about this user’s session. Click is being recorded and gets a new generated ID for this session.
 	The user immediately proceeds to the landing page after the first click, and now he has a user ID in his URL.
 	The user buys something on a landing page and conversion is correctly attributed.

RedTrack is well-known as a feature-rich and easy-to-use tool for S2S Postback Tracking at any scale. That's why neither Safari nor Google restrictions can't affect your ability to track ads if you work with multiple Traffic Sources. Want to learn more about how S2S postback tracking works?



 hbspt.cta.load(7519541, 'ef490f48-8ab0-4913-8668-57716f5d0600', {}); 

What are the pros and cons of the S2S postback tracking method?

⇒ pros
– Accurate tracking. S2S Postback URL tracking is the most accurate method for tracking conversions. Tracking is done server-side, therefore there is less randomness in results. Users can’t affect tracking by simply deleting their cookies as in the case with a tracking pixel.

– Secure and reliable. Less troubled with fraud and there are various options to prevent postback fraud.

– Flexibility. There are more options for sending a signal about a successful event, instead of firing a conversion at the loaded thank you page. This can be helpful when the offer owner wants to register conversion after shipping an order, or a successful call.

– Transparency. Can be used for verifying if there are any differences or distinctions in the number of conversions because RedTrack gets all the information about users' sessions with every click.
⇒ cons
– S2S Postback URL tracking is harder to setup. First-timers can have some difficulties setting it to work for the first time.
What can you track with Tracking Pixel and S2S Postbacks URL?
Actually, you can track any parameter of your campaign with both of them.

 	Clicks;
 	Conversions;

2558,S2S Conversion Tracking with ClickBank,"ClickBank is a well-known and one of the oldest affiliate networks on the internet that started long ago in 1998, somewhere in the startup-garage of San Diego. ClickBank offers a bunch of verticals for affiliates to run as well as provides an ability to place your offers as an advertiser. Moreover, ClickBank provides a marketplace for online-purchases. But did you know that you can do S2S conversion tracking with ClickBank? 

Today there are millions of entrepreneurs that work with ClickBank in 190 countries around the world. In this article we are going to dive deep into conversion tracking on ClickBank. It’s going to be beneficial for both advertisers and affiliates running ClickBank offers. 
What is S2S Tracking for ClickBank? 
If you ever tried running offers from an affiliate marketplace (like ClickBank) or you placed your own offers there, you faced a challenge of conversion tracking. Both affiliates and advertisers need a tool which will be performing ad tracking of the campaigns. 

Affiliates are in need for an ad tracker to do the following: 

 	Track performance in order to make better advertising decisions
 	Automate campaigns to be able to let go of the controls 
 	Report conversion to advertisers in order to receive payouts

Advertisers who use ad tracking technologies gain ability to: 

 	Control the performance of affiliate marketers who advertise their offers 
 	Compare the conversion data with what affiliates report to advertisers
 	Manage relationships with all affiliate marketers that are running their offers 

The “outdated way” for conversion tracking was the usage of pixel. They are easy to set up, however they have a bunch of disadvantages, like: 

 	Provide inaccurate conversion data 
 	Easily getting blocked by Ad Blockers 

The best way to perform conversion tracking for ClickBank offers is via using S2S Postback URL tracking. It is a server side tracking in comparison to browser-side tracking from Pixel. 

This solution is the most accurate when it comes to conversion data tracking. As well it is fully compliant with all the Privacy Updates by Google, Facebook, Apple, etc., and their cookieless updates. 
What are the benefits of using S2S Postback with ClickBank?
If you choose to run ClickBank offers, these are the benefits that you get when choosing S2S technology as your conversion tracking option. 

– Accurate measurement of conversions for offers from ClickBank

– There are less opportunities for fraud, as tracking happens on a server side

– You don't lose a conversion data for users who gave Ad Blockers installed

– You receive in-depth data not only about the conversion event, but about the whole funnel

See a detailed comparison of S2S Postback Tracking and Tracking Pixel in one of our recent publications.

However, ClickBank does not have a native S2S Conversion Tracking solution. Therefore you need a dedicated solution which will be able to provide the the technology described above. 
RedTrack’s solution for ClickBank conversion tracking  
Trying to find the best solution for affiliate marketers chasing higher payouts on ClickBank and advertisers who want to receive accurate conversion data, we started developing S2S integration for ClickBank accounts ourselves. 

RedTrack’s team developed a solution that can help you set up S2S tracking with no-tech skills and get to a new level of advertising ClickBank offers. 

Starting conversion tracking with RedTrack is super easy. All you need to do is to connect your ClickBank account inside the RedTrack interface. After this step, you will find a chance to embed S2S URLs for your tracking. 

Read our step-by-step instructions on how to integrate ClickBank and RedTrack in our Knowledge Base.
Why do you need an ad tracker when working with ClickBank? 
If we move away from the ability to use S2S conversion tracking for ClickBank offers, you get many other benefits when choosing RedTrack as your tracking solution: 

 	Consolidated multi-touch reporting for all your advertising channels 
 	Automation &amp; Smart Rules with 20+ traffic sources 
 	Multi-access if you are working within a team 
 	Native Facebook CAPI Integration if you run Facebook Ads 
 	Conversion attribution for in-depth user funnel analysis

2575,Push notifications: biggest buzzword or profitable trend?,"Just like native ads a couple of years ago, push notifications are rapidly growing in popularity among affiliate marketers. They now compete for a position of the “top traffic source of 2019”. This fact is proved by the adoption of this ad format by many ad networks.
Check our e-book “Trending Advertising Formats 2018-2019” and know why PropellerAds, MGID, ExoClick, Adcash, and other networks name push notifications as one of the top-promising traffic types for 2019. 
In this blog post, we’re going to brief: 
— what is push notification;
— what are the reasons for their popularity;
— how to make money on push notifications.
We also got in touch with the guys from MegaPu.sh — one of the leading Ad Networks of push notification traffic and asked them to share their expertise with our readers. Ready to go deep into the push notification world? Let’s start!

What is a push notification? 
Push notifications appear as an alert message with an image (or icon) in the user’s browser or mobile device. The click/tap on the notification opens the landing page/app window with an advertising offer. 

On the web (aka, desktop), push notification is made up of a title, description, image, and a shortened URL. 
On mobile (wearables, as well), push notifications look the same as a regular system notification and include text and small image/icon, as well. 
To start receiving push notification ads, the user first needs to opt-in to receive them. The fact that they can opt-out at any time ensures a reach of a highly engaged audience. 

What makes push notifications such a popular ad format?
With the growing recognition and adoption of push notifications, the benefits of this ad format become more and more evident. 
High ad visibility. Push notifications keep affiliates in direct contact with the users, as they appear right on their devices or browsers. This, in turn, results in maximum view-ability and very high CTR. 
High-quality traffic. With push notifications, you’re sending your promotion to a user who has already agreed to receive the messages — hence, they’re already interested in the product/service you advertise.
Bot-free traffic. Since users have to agree to start receiving the notifications, this scheme excludes bot traffic, meaning that ads are only seen by real users. It might be one of the most bot-free ad formats so far now. 
A good option for new affiliates. Push notification traffic is quite cheap, though the volumes are pretty solid. Besides, these traffic sources make it really easy to set up an affiliate campaign. 

How to make money on push notifications?
Once we’ve highlighted the key advantages of this ad format, let’s proceed with some practical knowledge. Ani, Marketing Manager from Megapu.sh helped us to highlight the most important tips when working with push ads. They are the following: 
Mobile orientation.
Push ads are the advertising messages that work both on mobile devices and desktops. 
Ani: As a common rule, people spend more time on mobile devices rather than desktops. Hence, push notifications sent to the mobile will receive a higher number of clicks. 
Vertical and GEO preferences.
Push ads perform well on a huge variety of verticals. A piece of advice from the RedTrack Team is to always check top verticals and geos and be in touch with the support team of the network you are planning to buy traffic from.
Ani: The verticals that perform the best in Megapu.sh now are dating, sweeps, products, casinos, crypto-currency. 

From MegaPu.sh interface
Ani: When creating a campaign on MegaPush, the system usually shows what the average CPC is. Its value depends on GEO and the highest bid the system has at the time of creating the campaign. 
A/B testing.  
Push notifications are easy to a/b test. Besides, the creative creation process is not difficult and it’s better to create more push notifications and test them by setting a bid right and limiting the daily budget/number of conversions. Find more about setting up limits and caps on visits with RedTrack here. 
A well-timed message can deliver far more value. You can leverage the granular campaign settings of the Megapu.sh platform, and set the start and stop time of your push notification running. 
Ani: Some users often ask if it’s better to point users directly to the affiliate offer, or to a lander first. The best way to find out if the offer works with or without Landing page is to test it. As it very much depends on GEO and the type of offer you’re promoting. 
Creatives rotation. 
Once you start running push notification campaign you have the best results, they go down slowly with time. The solution might be to refresh your creatives frequently.
Tip 1: push notifications with emojis result in CTR 70% increase. 
Tip 2: time-sensitive offers (e.g.: Hurry up! The sale ends in 2 hours) result in the highest open rates. 
Budget. 
The budget for push notifications really depends on what you’re going to run. For example, dating and sweepstakes offers have a quicker conversion funnel in comparison with Nutra, thus you would see the results much quicker with them, aka with less budget required. 
And what about start budget? Are push notifications newbie-friendly? 
Ani: The start budget can vary from $100 to 1,000. It depends on such factors, as vertical, offer, GEO you target, because the bigger the country — the bigger the database of users is, hence the created campaign will go to a bigger audience. The best way to handle it will be to set a budget limit of $1—5, so you'll not run out of money fast. 

To wrap everything up:
If push notification is a buzzword or a trend? We would definitely say — the latter one. Push notifications offer a number of advantages over more “traditional” ad formats. They beat the “ad blindness”, offer pretty cheap traffic with big volumes and high CTR.
The best way to form your opinion on this ad format is to test it out. Don’t be shy to share your ""Push"" experience with others in our Telegram Community! ",1/29/2019,https://redtrack.io/blog/how-push-notifications-work/,All|Industry

2668,Interview with a proper Texas man and Affiliate Summit co-founder Shawn Collins,"Shawn Collins has been in Affiliate Marketing since the 1997 year, and that's one of the reasons why he ended up creating the biggest affiliate marketing conference with Missy Ward. We are talking about the Affiliate Summit. 

Besides that, Shawn contrasts with the affiliates that promise to make you a millionaire in a few weeks and stands for the more ethical and balanced approach to affiliate marketing. Like in any real business, you have to progress here, and after that, you will be able to make a serious income out of it.

Shawn Collins doesn’t feel hollow, and that's what makes him a real person with a story behind his back in an industry where millionaires coming up from nowhere and are telling tales about their success.

Now he is also working on his This is Affiliate Marketing podcast, which might be the best in this field due to the diversity of guests and their professional skills, and his blog AffiliateTip.com. 

Interview with Shawn Collins 

What challenges do you see for affiliate marketers today, or in other words, who is a good affiliate today, which tools does he use, and what skills are essential for him?

Competition is tougher year to year as more people enter affiliate marketing. Also, it continually becomes more challenging to come up with a new, original angle to build an audience. 

There really isn't one answer there, since affiliate is more of an umbrella term for people writing content, copy for paid search, video creators, podcasters, coupon sites, etc. I primarily blog original content, so really the most important tool to me is WordPress.

Do you believe that affiliate marketing is now requiring everyone to be a tech-savvy?

Not at all – the barrier to entry has gotten lower over time. Back when I started in 1997 I was self-taught on writing HTML and graphic design. Now there are so many tools to do things easily or outsource cheaply.

Where did it all start? How did you start working in Affiliate Marketing?

Back in 1997, I came across the Amazon affiliate program. I was newly married and had just purchased my first house and was struggling to make ends meet. I created my first affiliate site as an ugly, simple page on AOL (America Online). It was focused on things to do in New York City and I'd feature books about NYC. 

Back then the Amazon affiliate program didn't have online reporting – you'd get an email with stats once a quarter – so you could be making lots of mistakes for months before you realized it. I went to my first quarter without making any money, and then a little in the second quarter. But after making some money I was locked in and kept building on small successes.

The world has changed since 1997 when you started working in affiliate marketing. What do you think will happen to affiliate marketing in future?

Affiliate marketing isn't going anywhere – it's a key strategy for nearly every e-commerce company, and as e-commerce continues to grow, so will affiliate marketing. 

With rising trends of personalization in advertisement, and additional information about the user, it seems that affiliates will be able to come at the door of a person who visited their e-commerce page a few times. Can you see it this way? (Or what trends do you see?)

Yes, I like remarketing a lot, because it is very effective. However, based on the people I have spoken with about it as consumers, they feel like it is invasive, and don't like it. With data breaches being so common, as well as the public being clued into services like Cambridge Analytica, I think people have become paranoid about marketing that seems too personal or targeted. 

But they also respond to it, so I think we'll continue to see targeting elevate even more.



Your work has been dedicated to Affiliate Summit for many years. Do you still practice affiliate marketing by yourself or manage affiliate programs? Can you tell us a little bit about offers that you worked with and funnels that you have built up?

For the first five years of Affiliate Summit, I was also an affiliate manager for a number of brands, because I couldn't support my family solely on the earnings from Affiliate Summit. But in 2008 I began focusing only on Affiliate Summit. However, I have been an affiliate straight through since 1997 to varying degrees.

I have focused on content creation around topics that interest me and products/services I use. It's been very straightforward – no funnels.

Can you describe your experience with different verticals?

I've focused on hard goods from retailers for the most part – books, clothing, computers. Also B2B services such as hosting and domain names. It's all really been the same formula – content creation in my voice and leveraging organic search, though I've done Google AdWords and Facebook Ads a bit, too. 

Creating Affiliate Summit is a lot of fun or a lot of challenge?

It's always been a combination of both – it's been fun to come up with and execute ideas, especially things competitors thought were ridiculous, but then later copied. Neither my co-founder Missy nor myself had a background in running events, so we were making things up as we went along – that led us to having to be creative and efficient.

Do you remember any funny or unique situations from one of Affiliate Summit conferences?

Nearly every time I am working at an Affiliate Summit I have people approach me (I wear a staff shirt that offers to help people) and ask if I know Shawn Collins or know where to find him. Some people even tell me they know him, and they are surprised and confused when I introduce myself.

How do you manage conferences on different sides of the planet?

We held a conference in London in 2007 and it was very challenging because we didn't have anybody based in England to help us. There was a big learning curve and lots of frustration. So, we didn't try it again until after we were acquired, and one of the reasons we wanted to sell Affiliate Summit was to get together with a company that knew how to run events around the globe, and we found that in Clarion Events. 

Tell us the story of your highest CTR (or success, because it’s always interesting).  

I can't recall particulars at this point, but the earliest successes were the most exciting because I desperately needed them to happen. Back in the 1990s, there were affiliate programs that paid per click, and I realized I could easily buy super cheap clicks from early paid search player GoTo.com and drive the traffic straight to affiliate links. I was buying clicks for $0.01 and instantly reselling them for $0.10. My only regret is that I didn't scale this up more.

Shawn, what are your plans for the next years?

After selling Affiliate Summit, part of the deal was that we would stay on for a while to transition the company, so I am working as an employee now with Affiliate Summit and GeekCast.fm and FeedFront.com are part of the company. AffiliateTip.com is my own site, and I've been posting affiliate marketing related content there for about 15 years and don't have any intentions on stopping. I really enjoy when people are moved, motivated, excited about the things I write for FeedFront Magazine, and it's very satisfying to see plans come together for conferences and smaller things like marketing campaigns. 

Shawn, if you weren't an Affiliate, who would you rather be?

When I was growing up and even after college there was no such thing as affiliate marketing – I learn about it and got started in it when I was 27. My primary interest was always to be a writer, and I have managed to do plenty of it as an affiliate marketer with blogging and magazine writing.

2875,How to add SSL Certificate in RedTrack,"SSL Certificate is a special sign that shows to user’s browser that your website can be trusted, allowing a secure connection. More precisely, it’s a cryptographic key that contains details about your organization. Lately, it became the new standard in web browsing, and now all trusted websites have an installed SSL Certificate. It is made to secure credit card transactions, data transfers, and logging in to websites. You can apply SSL Certificate in RedTrack if you have connected a custom tracking domain in Domains settings.  
Custom tracking domain vs. default tracking domain
When user is clicking on the ad, he is being redirected through the tracking domain of RedTrack. That’s where we get all the data about his session and are creating a click id for his event. Default tracking domain (http://rdtrck2.com) already has an SSL Certificate. Adding your own SSL Certificate is available only if you have added your own website domain.

Choosing which tracking domain to use is pretty similar to the case when you are choosing domain for your website. You can always use a third-party free domain that is provided by the platform (for example, when you have made a landing page in the landing page builder), which is a default tracking domain in this case. But you can also buy and use your own domain, which is equal to a custom tracking domain. Here are the key ideas that you need to know about tracking domains:

Default tracking domain (http://rdtrck2.com)

– Provided for free

– You don’t need to do anything. It will work from the start. 

– Because it is used by the majority of RedTrack users, and due to the variety of advertising campaigns that they are running, sometimes it can be blocked by antivirus software and ad blocking plugins. 

Custom tracking domain (any domain that you possess) 

– You need to buy it if you don’t have one already.

– Adding a custom domain isn’t hard at all, but you will need to work for 15 minutes.  

– Custom domains look attractive and secure for users, advertising networks, antiviruses and ad block plugins. Especially, when they correlate with products that you promote in your advertisement.  
Adding SSL Certificate
There is a huge variety of websites where you can buy SSL Certificates. Our clients are often buying them at gogetssl.com.

After the purchase, you will receive an SSL Certificate and Key. You need to copy and paste them to appropriate fields in RedTrack Domains settings. It will look like this:



Without an SSL Certificate, Google will warn users that your website can be unsafe for visiting. It also looks unsafe for the majority of browsers and security software systems.

But you shouldn’t think that SSL Certificates can give you indisputable preferences. If you will run advertising campaigns with content that is not approved by major advertising networks like Google or Facebook, they will ban you even if you have an SSL Certificate.

We recommend everyone to use custom tracking domains and SSL Certificates to run your ads, except in cases when you are testing your advertising campaigns and want to make it swift and easy. Drop us a line if you still have questions: support@redtrack.io

2876,"Affiliate Marketing has a Woman’s Face: Missy Ward, Sarah Bundy, Maryellen Garasky","Affiliate Marketing has become a multi-billion dollar industry with the appearance of digital advertising networks, blogs, social networks, and recognition by major brands. New technologies, tracking capabilities and the growth of data push forward communication between advertisers and affiliates.

But there is still a lack of highlighting the professionals in Affiliate Marketing who are building the industry, or changing it right now. And in many cases, it’s women who are working behind Affiliate Networks, Programs and Communities that bring affiliates together.

Read the next article: Affiliate Marketing has a woman’s face: Tricia Meyer, Rosalind Gardner



Missy Ward, Co-CEO of Affiliate Summit
Missy Ward has launched Affiliate Summit back in 2003 with Shawn Collins. She started to work in Affiliate Marketing before that in 1999 and tried all sides of the industry: working as an Affiliate Manager for merchants and networks, and sole affiliate herself. Missy marketed DRTV products, travel, software, health and beauty, electronics, office products and services, and home goods.
How did you start working in Affiliate Marketing?

Back in 1988, I was hired to do paste-ups (the way pages were laid out before Quark, PageMaker, InDesign, etc.). Many companies and job positions later, I was a VP of Marketing for a start-up here in Florida. One day back in 1999, one of the owners came into my office so excited about this new thing he heard of where this company had these virtual, independent consultants that marketed the company’s product on their own, with no expense to the company. The best part was that the company would only have to pay those independent consultants a commission if they made a sale. He was referring to Amazon, and it was their Associates Program.

 It became my job to figure out how they did it and make it happen for us. Since then, I’ve sported lots of hats in this industry including those worn by advertisers, affiliate managers (for both individual merchants and networks) and affiliates.

 In 2003 I co-founded Affiliate Summit Corporation with my business partner, Shawn Collins on with a $400 investment, which grew from a small gathering of a few early adopters into a highly-respected global conference series, hosting thousands of attendees yearly. In 2017, Clarion Events acquired Affiliate Summit Corporation, and I remain the Co-CEO. I also still run a handful of niche affiliate websites and invest in companies within the industry.

Can you tell us about the most important episodes of your career?

There have been many highlights in my career, but I guess the one that I’m most proud of (besides Affiliate Summit) was starting Affiliate Marketers Give Back, an organization I founded back in 2007. AMGB raises money for organizations that support breast cancer research, treatment, awareness and community programs through combined efforts within the affiliate marketing industry. I’m delighted to say that, to date, we’ve raised over $625,000.

Which verticals and areas of Affiliate Marketing do you work with?

Because I’ve worked on all sides of the industry, you name the B2C product or service; I’ve probably tried it at some point; either marketing it myself or managing it through a network. I only work with companies that have been around for a long time and run affiliate-friendly, compliant offers and programs.

After all the experience, what can you say about Affiliate Marketing?

I started when this industry was in its infancy. It was the Wild West back then, and let’s just say that best judgment by affiliates and merchants was not always used. But that’s changed dramatically over the years.

 Brands are showing an even greater interest and investing in our performance-based, trackable, multi-billion marketing channel. Couple that with all of the technology innovations and marketing platforms currently deployed and still in development and that’s a recipe for a very bright future.

Tell us the story of your highest CTR.

I've had amazing success marketing DRTV products throughout the years, but the one that I'm working on now is blowing it out of the water. So... I'm not sharing yet!

Can you share about failures that you had in Affiliate Marketing?

Although I won’t share the brand name, my most massive failure stemmed from marketing a product that I didn’t research properly. Now, I always advise affiliates to make sure they’re not endorsing something that is being marketed using false claims; is being investigated by organizations or trade groups, or is simply plain old junk. Not only can you wind up in legal trouble yourself, but it can destroy your online reputation.

What tools should an Affiliate Marketer use?  

Although I haven’t switched to it yet, I finally previewed Affluent Analytics (Affluent.io), and I’m in love. In fact, I’m mad at myself for not using it already. It allows you to view all of the critical data related to the affiliate programs you’re marketing in one spot rather than having a gazillion tabs open and copying and pasting stats into a spreadsheet. It can save you hours and helps you spot winners and losers a whole lot quicker.

What do you need to be good at Affiliate Marketing?

The number one skill required to be successful in affiliate marketing is stick-to-it-iveness. There is no magic bullet nor foolproof way of integrating it into your marketing efforts. Like any business, it takes time, effort and optimization to succeed.

If you weren’t an Affiliate Marketer, who would you rather be?

Wine is one of my passions, and I love sharing my wine knowledge with friends, so I guess I'd shoot for being a Master Sommelier.

How did you start working in Affiliate Marketing?

When I was fresh out of college, I got a job at Clearly.ca (also known as Coastal.com), working under the wing of then-founder and CEO, Roger Hardy. I was hired as the sales manager for the call centre, helping the call reps be successful at cross-selling and up-selling customers when they called in. 

Within three months, the call centre sales grew by 26% (which, for a multi-million dollar company wasn't insignificant). At that same time, they decided to part ways with their then-affiliate manager, and asked me to take over the affiliate program too. Not knowing what that was, they said it was like running the sales division, but working with ""affiliates"" who worked on a commission basis only. 

It took me six months to figure out what I was doing and how all the moving pieces worked together, but found that once I got it, I loved it and was really good at it because it combined all my interests in sales, marketing, analytics, strategy, customer service, growth and leadership. That was back in 2004. I'm now into my 15th year as an affiliate marketer.

Can you tell us about the most important episodes of your career?

Being taken under the wing of Roger Hardy was the first big break in my career, because I got to see first hand how to create a strong culture of success, build a brand from the ground up, engage and grow a high performance team, learn the e-commerce and affiliate marketing spaces, understand how consumers in the US and Canadian Markets behaved, and enhanced many people and leadership skills that I didn't have before joining his team. 

Later, when I set out to build All Inclusive Marketing (AIM) from the ground up, I found that I used every skill that I had learned while at Clearly, while pushing myself to focusing on our purpose, vision, mission and core values which drove growth. 

Which verticals and areas of Affiliate Marketing do you work with?

Our focus has been and remains the eCommerce, Retail and Travel &amp; Hospitality sectors, because of my personal expertise in these areas when we started, and because there are still many gaps in these two markets. 

The e-commerce sector alone is continuing to grow double digitals each year on every populated continent on the planet, and the travel sector is a trillion dollar industry that has limited expertise in the affiliate marketing space. We consider ourselves strong and well versed in both of these areas, so will continue to service them at a level of excellence we expect of our team and brands.

After all the experience, what can you say about Affiliate Marketing?

My favorite thing about the affiliate marketing space is that it is ever changing. I am the type of person who thrives off of challenges and change, thinking on my feet, hungry to learn and grow, and bringing opportunities to those around me. 

Affiliate marketing allows us to do that in every way, from the types of relationships we have with publishers, to the discovery and implementation of new technologies, including AI, to consumer behaviors changing rapidly each year. Many people can't keep up with all the moving pieces and don't like the change, but that's what I find exciting and refreshing about it. 

People who thrive in an ever-changing, fast paced environment, who love data and people combined, and are creative problem solvers would do well in the affiliate marketing space.

Tell us the story of your highest CTR.

My greatest personal accomplishment was building a company that became a PROFIT500 Company, won Company of the Year out of 400,000 small businesses in British Columbia, and was recognized as a Global Excellence Award winner within the Performance Marketing space worldwide. Why? Because it took a village to accomplish these things, and it's our team and the people around me that make all the difference in the world. Being able to build something of substance where people can align, want to contribute and grow together is something meaningful to me. And most importantly, we have done it by staying true to ourselves, our core values, our brand promise, and each other.

Can you share about failures that you had in Affiliate Marketing?

I went through an unfortunate stage of having an ego and assuming I was always right. It created some uncomfortable situations with people I loved and admired, and changed our relationship. Fortunately, I have grown since then and have learned how to listen, which types of questions to ask to better understand others, and have further developed my communication skills to communicate ideas and convictions more clearly and objectively. In a business where relationships matter, these are things I had to learn the harder way, but am glad I did, because I've come out a better leader, business person and friend in the end.

What tools should an Affiliate Marketer use?  

A few tools in the affiliate space that people might want to look at are Affluent, Trackonomics, Mediarails, Publisher Discovery, and Brandverity, to name a few.

What do you need to be good at Affiliate Marketing?

An open mind, the ability to analyze data objectively, a creative approach, strong relationship skills, strong communication skills, and the desire to act on great partnership opportunities!

If you weren’t an Affiliate Marketer, who would you rather be?

A spa and travel writer... which I can still do in affiliate marketing, so not sure that counts!



Maryellen Garasky, In-house Brand Affiliate Manager
Maryellen is managing the Affiliate Program for Jane.com and is working mostly with content creators, promoting B2C products. She leads the team that won an Affiliate Summit Pinnacle Award for Merchant of the Year in 2018.
How did you start working in Affiliate Marketing?

I got started as a blogger and content builder. I ran a hyper-local blog about my resort hometown and included affiliate links in my content. From there I went to work at an agency where I managed affiliate programs on behalf of our clients. I now work in-house at Jane.com.

Can you tell us about the most important episodes of your career?

It's hard to say. I've had so many wonderful experiences and met so many great people that it's difficult to choose. Recently, however, I would say it was winning the Affiliate Summit Pinnacle Award for Merchant of the Year in 2018.

Which verticals and areas of Affiliate Marketing do you work with?

I work with many different kinds of affiliate partners. From cash back sites to deal sites to bloggers to social influencers. But, if I'm honest, I love content builders best. Having gotten my start there, I don't hide the fact that they are my favorite category of partner to work with. I understand that ""always on"" mentality and the grind to make things move.

After all the experience, what can you say about Affiliate Marketing?

I simply love it. I love the people. I love the job itself. I love that it takes equal parts people-person and data-nerd and that it changes from moment to moment. I love the freedom it gives me to support my family. My daughter is a competitive swimmer and I take her to practice every day. I can work from the pool deck and be just as effective there as I am when I'm in my home office.

Can you share about failures that you had in Affiliate Marketing?

While I got my start as a publisher, I didn't do very well. In fact, I look back now and can list off the things that I did wrong. However, I can tell you that it actually helps me manage our program. I think my sincere desire to help others is obvious. At least that's what I've been told. There is a certain amount of tenacity needed to succeed in affiliate marketing. I didn't have it then. I do now.

What tools should an Affiliate Marketer use? 

Should use = PrettyLinks Pro (no, I'm not an affiliate, no I'm not paid to endorse).

Should use = Microsoft Excel (to analyze what your customers are buying and trends – seriously, Excel would run the world).

What do you need to be good at Affiliate Marketing?

Equal parts people-person and data-nerd. Let's be honest, people like to work with people they like. Be likeable. Be honest. Be transparent. Be bold, but be nice about it.

As far as data-nerd, think about it... this is performance marketing (emphasis on ""performance""). You need to know what your customers are buying, how much they are buying, how often they buy, where you are getting your best EPC, etc. etc. etc. If you don't know these kinds of things, chances of you getting paid a sustainable income are pretty slim.

If you weren’t an Affiliate Marketer, who would you rather be?

Innkeeper on Kauai with my husband running our family style restaurant and my daughter running our cafe. Maybe a surf shop. Seriously, this consumes our conversations.

2877,"Affiliate Marketing has a Woman’s Face: Tricia Meyer, Rosalind Gardner","Affiliate Marketing has become a multi-billion dollar industry with the appearance of digital advertising networks, blogs, social networks, and recognition by major brands. New technologies, tracking capabilities and the growth of data push forward communication between advertisers and affiliates.

But there is still a lack of highlighting the professionals in Affiliate Marketing who are building the industry, or changing it right now. And in many cases, it’s women who are working behind Affiliate Networks, Programs and Communities that bring affiliates together.

Tricia Meyer, Performance Marketing Association Executive Director, and Sole Affiliate
Tricia is the Executive Director of the Performance Marketing Association. She also runs different blogs for years and monetize them through affiliate marketing, and owns a cashback website.
How did you start working in Affiliate Marketing?

While I was an attorney working for LexisNexis in their online content division (2004), I started a website to create my own ""content"" as a new mom. I used it as an outlet to talk to other moms but started noticing that other similar sites were linking to big brands like Target. I found a program that allowed me to trace links and that led me to an affiliate network (Be Free). From there I started reading message boards about affiliate marketing and figuring out how to incorporate it into my content. I started my loyalty site about a year later as a way to share my affiliate revenue with my friends and readers.

Can you tell us about the most important episodes of your career?

Attending Affiliate Summit for the first time opened my eyes to all of the possibilities in the industry. Not only did I learn a lot about how affiliate marketing worked, but I met people who were willing to share their expertise and help me become successful. Subsequent conferences helped me find new business partners, consulting opportunities, and even new niches. One of the most important moments in my career came the day I quit my full-time job and decided to sink or swim in affiliate marketing.

Which verticals and areas of Affiliate Marketing do you work with?

As the owner of a cashback website, I work in almost every vertical. It gives me a nice bird's eye view of what is converting in the industry, which merchants are good to work with, and how to make the most of all of the different networks. It's old school, but I firmly believe that having a mailing list helps insulate you from changing algorithms across both social media and organic search. Those are great traffic sources when they work, but having a list or a loyal member base can help you sustain your business when those traffic sources dry up.

After all the experience, what can you say about Affiliate Marketing?

This industry is constantly changing and you have to continue to evolve if you want to stay in it. Traffic sources change. Merchants close down. Networks get bought out. Competition increases as more people learn about the industry. You don't necessarily have to change what you do, but you may have to change the way that you do it.

Tell us the story of your highest CTR.

Know your audience. I have made the most money when I have come across an offer that I know is perfect for my audience. For example, I have a lot of Disney fans across both my loyalty site and my blog. When a CPA network ran an offer for a free Disney bumper sticker, I jumped on it as fast as I could type. I ran it across my blog, my newsletter, and my social media. Not only did everyone click, but my conversion rates were through the roof.

Can you share about failures that you had in Affiliate Marketing?

Just one? I could probably write a book! The thing about most of my biggest failures in Affiliate Marketing is that in retrospect, I learned something from them so the further out I get from them, the less I feel like a failure. I think where I have failed most was being too trusting of potential partner relationships and not getting money up front. I was so eager to help them that I jumped right in with advice and even exposure on my site. But when they didn't get the result they were hoping for, I was left with nothing but a ""lesson learned""--which doesn't pay the bills!

What tools should an Affiliate Marketer use? 

I use Pretty Links on every one of my sites to help manage affiliate links. You should also use some kind of tools for automating your newsletter (both helping drive signups as well as the actual mailings). It's easy to think those things happen organically without the tools, but to scale you really need them. An image editor is also important both for editing blog images and social media images. I also use 2 different social media schedulers. Look for your own personal pain points to determine what you aren't good at and therefore need help technically.

What do you need to be good at Affiliate Marketing?

To be good at Affiliate Marketing you need to be flexible. You need to be able to change with technology and the industry. You need to be willing to try new things even when the old things are still working.

If you weren’t an Affiliate Marketer, who would you rather be?

If I were not an affiliate marketer, I would go back to being an attorney because sometimes I really miss it, and my kids are old enough that I don't need to be at home. Luckily there are enough affiliate marketing legal topics that some days I get to be both!



Rosalind Gardner, Blogger and book writer about Affiliate Marketing
Rosalind Gardner has worked in Affiliate Marketing for more than 20 years, focusing on blogs, B2C products, services and dating vertical. Rosalind works from her home in summer and her RV in winter, earning a full-time income through affiliate marketing as a blogger. She wrote a book called «The Super Affiliate Handbook: How I Made $436,797 in One Year Selling Other People’s Stuff Online».
How did you start working in Affiliate Marketing?

In 1996 I built a 3-page seed exchange website from which I traded flower seeds with gardeners from around the world. Experience with that site made me realize the web’s potential as a marketplace – so I started looking for online business opportunities at that point.

 In late 1997, I discovered affiliate marketing and started a site to review online dating services – a topic about which, at the time, I was relatively knowledgeable, having had a number of unsavory experiences with chat room lurkers. 

When online dating sites started offering webmasters the opportunity to promote their services, I felt a strong desire to share my experience with others in order to keep them safe in their search for love online. 

Can you tell us about the most important episodes of your career?

To share what I’d learned about affiliate marketing, in 2003 I self-published “The Super Affiliate Handbook: How I Made $436,797 in One Year Selling Other People’s Stuff Online”. 

My book turned out to be the first comprehensive guide to affiliate marketing and the response was overwhelming in terms of the numbers of people who learned how they too could earn money online as affiliate marketers.

As a result of the book, I ended up taking my message about affiliate marketing by speaking at conferences all over the world. 

Which verticals and areas of Affiliate Marketing do you work with?

My very first site (101Date.com) was about online dating, with dating site reviews. After publishing my book, I started writing regularly about affiliate marketing and doing business online at what is now RosalindGardner.com. 

I also maintain two other websites, one a personal blog (RosalindGardner.me) on which I write about travel, food and RVing; while the other site (WindingWay.com) sells watches through a drop-shipping arrangement with Eduardo Milieris of Watchcraft in New York City.

After all the experience, what can you say about Affiliate Marketing?

Of all the different ways to make money online, I’d suggest that affiliate marketing has the lowest barriers to entry – for bloggers who are truly passionate about their subject. 

The cost to set up a blog is negligible when compared with those involved in setting up a brick and mortar business. 

Moreover, there are no production costs, having to carry inventory, order-processing, shipping or handling of products. Affiliate marketers don’t need to provide customer service for the products that they promote.

Best of all, is that as an affiliate marketer, you can work from anywhere you have an Internet connection and your business runs 24/7 - literally meaning that you can be making money while you sleep. Waking up to discover that you’ve earned commissions overnight is a truly wonderful feeling! 

Tell us the story of your highest CTR.

In addition to creating a wonderful lifestyle for myself that I would never have dreamed possible, I feel that my greatest success has been in helping others do the same.

Can you share about failures that you had in Affiliate Marketing?

My biggest Affiliate Marketing mistake was due to laziness on my part. 

I started a newsletter called the “Singles eScene” for my dating service review site which, at the time of my serious email marketing mistake, had 103,000 subscribers.

One day, I sent that newsletter out to extend an offer to attend a free John Gray teleseminar. 

Within a few days of receiving that message, more than 14,000 people unsubscribed from my newsletter.

Why? Well, more than 7 months had elapsed between mailings! Most of those subscribers were probably wondering, ‘What the heck is the Singles eScene?’ and/or ‘I didn’t signup for this!’

It was a costly mistake as I know that on average, two of every 100 [SeS] subscribers bought an annual dating service membership for $70.00, and four more would purchase recurring monthly $24.95 memberships that they keep for an average of 6 months. With a 50% commission rate… I had tossed $4440 down the drain over the next twelve months.

What tools should an Affiliate Marketer use? 

My blogs are all built on the Wordpress platform, with StudioPress Genesis themes. 

I use a variety of Wordpress plugins to enhance the functionality of my blogs and to optimize them for the search engines. 

Of all the tools I use in my affiliate marketing business, I consider my autoresponder service, Aweber, to be the most important, for as long as you have a list of subscribers, it doesn’t matter if your site goes down (as mine did), you can still contact them with an offer that will earn you a commission. 

What do you need to be good at Affiliate Marketing?

To be successful as an affiliate marketer, I believe you need to be absolutely passionate about your topic (niche) and have a strong desire to share your knowledge honestly with those who read your blog. 

Moreover, affiliate marketers should choose products to promote that they actually like and use, rather than trying to sell items simply for the sake of earning a big commission. 

When you treat your readers with the same respect with which you want to be treated, you build trusting, enduring and fruitful relationships. 

If you weren’t an Affiliate Marketer, who would you rather be?

A full-time retiree and traveler.

2975,Challenges affiliates face: how to overcome them?,"*The proposed content was primarily delivered during the speech at the European Summit — one of the largest affiliate marketing conferences in dating, gambling, gaming, and other online marketing verticals.
Affiliate Marketing is a dynamic industry. 
Despite the countless opinion columns claiming affiliate marketing is dead, total affiliate marketing spend is expected to surpass $6.8 billion by 2020. That’s a more than 50% increase over 2016 totals.

But, while affiliate marketing presents plenty of opportunities to make money online, there are also some risks and challenges worth considering. 
In this post, I’m going to list three common challenges that affiliate marketers face. Keep on reading and know how to overcome them to make your success in this industry more predictive and controlled.
Challenges that affiliates are facing today: 


 	Ad Fraud boom 
 	Browser ad restrictions
 	Ad-blocking 

Ad Fraud is a regnant problem
Ad fraud is one of the most talked about issues, as it affects mostly all the players of the online advertising industry. According to the most recent research, in 2018 about $51 million daily was lost to click fraud or $19 billion throughout the year. Statistically, this is equivalent to a 227% increase over the course of two years! 
Monetary losses, messy analytics, damage of reputation and relationships between affiliates and advertisers — are the main damages caused by ad fraud. 
Fighting fraud requires understanding and recognizing various types of fraud. The most common ones are the following: 


 	click spam: this type of fraud happens when a fraudster attributes clicks to users who haven’t made them and absolutely unaware of this fact;
 	click injection: type of click spamming, exposed to Android devices;
 	device farms: also known as phone or click farms are used to create fraudulent clicks, install and mobile engagement;
 	domain spoofing;
 	cookie stuffing: consist of attaching multiple cookies to users without their knowledge;
 	proxy sales;
 	etc.

[caption id=""attachment_2988"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""900""] Image source: fraudscore.ai[/caption]

&nbsp;
What should I do to secure yourself from fraud traffic and stop losing money on it?
Big players that are involved in the online advertising industry have already introduced quite a few regulations that are intended to stop or at least limit the fraudulent traffic growth. 
On November 2018 — Instagram started banning the users or delete the content that was not-organically boosted with likes and comments thanks to third-party apps. With these measures, they want to remove inauthentic activity that misleads many advertisers. 
As of 2019, Google has started removing apps from the store that were proved to use ad fraud schemes, i.e. in-app install attribution abuse. Google Play has already banned three malicious SDKs. Besides, they’ve recently announced that they will continue to investigate and improve their capabilities to better detect and protect against malicious and abusive behavior behind the mobile app industry. 
In May 2018, the World Federation of Advertisers has published a Charter where they claimed zero tolerance to ad fraud as one of their key principles.
All these preventions definitely work, but they’re out of our control. Then, an apparent question arises — How can I directly detect and prevent fraud? 

There are several warning signs which can indicate anomalies and define bot or fraud activity:

 	An abnormally huge gap between the number of impressions and conversions;
 	Increased bounce rates from your landing page; 
 	Uneven traffic distribution — unjustified splashes of traffic increase;
 	Traffic that is referred from unknown domains. 

How to retrieve this information? Use tracking tools and leverage traffic logs deep analysis. It provides you with raw data about every click and conversion that your ad receives.

Consequently, with the growth of interest in traffic quality analysis, advertisers and media buyers have started more eagerly address the services that can ensure that click fraud is kept in check. To meet the market requirements, RedTrack has reached out to our Partners, the anti-fraud tool — FraudScore. As a result of our joint work, we’ve released an effective anti-fraud feature inside RedTrack — Fraud Report. Now, you can receive a holistic overview of the traffic you buy in real time and evaluate the quality of each click based on five categories: 


 	Ok
 	Attribution 
 	Baddevice
 	Blacklist
 	Datacenter
 	Proxy

Learn the details of Fraud Report parameters here.
With Fraud Report, receive an overall campaign performance overview and stop wasting money on low-quality, i.e. fraud traffic. To activate click quality checker under your RedTrack account, contact our team — support@redtrack.io.
&nbsp;

Do browser ad restrictions make tracking impossible? 
The internet is an ad-tracking machine. Every advertising you see online is shown to you based on the information about your web visits that were previously tracked and collected by different services and agencies. Targeted advertising is still the best way to make money online.

Still, the problem of web-based tracking in the affiliate industry is much debated due to some issues, like: 


 	Restrictions on third-party cookies by browsers; 
 	Cookie notifications enforced as a response to GDPR;
 	Blockers by one of the major traffic sources, like Google.

What are the restrictions by browsers? 
On summer, Safari has released the Intelligent Tracking Prevention update, that has largely impacted the tracking capabilities of performance and affiliate marketing campaigns. This update starts blocking any tracking with third-party cookies, and therefore claims to protect users’ privacy on the web. Mozilla Firefox became the next browser that has introduced this update. Altogether it is almost 22% of all the population that is using the internet with these browsers, and it definitely can affect your conversions. 
But let’s address the basics of tracking. When it comes to performance marketing, there are two conversion tracking methods that are used by the players: cookie or pixel tracking and S2S or postback tracking.

What’s the difference between the pixel and S2S tracking?
Pixel tracking (aka, cookie tracking) relies on the user’s browser to track conversions. Every user’s web visit is stored in a cookie that is called again once a conversion happens and attributes this action to the correct affiliate. Thanks to a simple set-up, this tracking method is loved by many affiliates.
Postback tracking (aka, S2S tracking), instead, relies on the advertiser’s servers to track sessions generated on clicks to attribute conversions. In other words, this method is independent of the user’s browser and works equally well with Safari, Chrome, Mozilla, etc.
Read more: What is the difference between Pixel and S2S postback tracking?
The enhanced tracking prevention updates by Safari and Mozilla challenged the cookies tracking. Still, it hasn’t impacted the more reliable method — postback tracking. Unlike cookie tracking, S2S tracking is mobile friendly and less prone to fraud. 
The different approach was introduced by Google and Chrome browser.

Why Google stops publishers and advertisers to earn more?
Since Google is a member of the Coalition for Better Ads, it should take its online advertising controls in accordance with their standards. On February, Google started blocking ads that violate the ad standards (under the guise of the Coalition for Better Ads) on the websites that are accessed through the Chrome browser. 
After surveying nearly 66,000 web and mobile users, the Coalition identified four categories of desktop ads and eight types of mobile ads that fall below the non-user-friendly formats:
&nbsp;


How does this change influence the players of the affiliate marketing industry? 
Some ad networks change the formats they work with, others shift focus from intrusive formats, e.g. pop-up to less intrusive — pop-under. 
Many affiliate networks that rely on affiliates who use pop-up with pin submits and adult offers, have to adapt to some changes as well. 
Google standards, instead, make Google’s ad units, such as search and display, even more appealing for media buyers and affiliates. Native ads and facebook ads would stand to profit as well. 
My advice would be to work with trusted ad networks and strengthen the relationships with them, as they're interested in providing reliable and qualitative traffic sources to you.

3027,Fraud: to pay or not to pay? - Brand new feature by RedTrack,"Pay for fraud? There are no such questions. You just do not want to do it. But you might be doing it every day without knowing. According to the most recent research, in 2018 about $51 million daily was lost to click fraud or $19 billion throughout the year.
Do you want to know exactly how much YOU are spending on non-human traffic? Then keep on reading.

Fraud Report by RedTrack
After a few months of test work, we’re glad to announce the release of Fraud Report in RedTrack. Now, get a complete overview of the traffic you buy and whether the money you’ve spent is being served to bots and non-human traffic. 
Fraud Report is not just a solution that evaluates your traffic and marks it “fraud”  or “non-fraud”. It inspects the quality of every ad click based on 13 metrics and provides the ratio of human clicks and fraud ones with the reason of fraud behavior. Whether it’s an action caused by cookie stuffing or a proxy-connected user, etc, RedTrack detects it and notify you of suspicious activity.

How and why are you buying non-human traffic?
Below is the screenshot of the RedTrack Fraud Report test by one of our early adopters.

Have a look at the blacklist column. Honestly, the numbers are very alerting. Fraud clicks for some publishers comprise more than half of the overall volume. And yes — in this campaign, our user paid for quite a few bots. 

Why waste money on low-quality traffic? 
That was your starting point. You run your fraud report in RedTrack.io and you knew you paid for bots. That’s the fact you cannot ignore, right? So what’s next? Does it mean that you cannot trust a traffic source? We would say — still too early to draw such conclusions. 
Instead, RedTrack provides our customers with the possibility of in-depth analysis with the option to create custom reports based on 20+ filters. Drill down the fraud report to subid / IPs etc to identify the culprit who wants to make easy money with you and your traffic source. Block these IPs on the traffic source’s side to protect yourself from non-human traffic or provide fraudulent publishers with the undeniable evidence and ask for charge-back. 
If you cannot filter by IP on your traffic source side, you can exclude this traffic in RedTrack panel. Use bot blacklist functionality in RedTrack and exclude bot traffic from being added to your statistics. Besides, such traffic will not be counted towards events included in your RedTrack plan.


I’m using Fraud Report by RedTrack for checking my push traffic now. Like everything on RedTrack, it’s simple, efficient and affordable. 
While testing fraud check with my ad campaigns I came to several big and bad surprises: 


 	If I breakdown the report by push providers, I had a percentage of 20% to 40% of bad clicks.
 	The worst of all, apparently, is that if I breakdown by “source id” (from each specific traffic provider), results aren’t so different. I mean, there is a high percentage of bad traffic in analyzed sources. 

Since now I have all this data in my RedTrack panel — I see where I have fraudulent clicks. With this information, I’m going to talk to all providers about that and see what they will say to me.

Henrique,

3153,How and Why to Fight Ad Fraud in Digital Advertising?,"It’s been a month since we launched our brand-new feature — Fraud Report. 
Fraud Report is a cutting-edge solution that evaluates the traffic you buy and reports whether the money is being served to bots and non-human traffic.
If you missed our previous post that reveals the essence of our new anti-fraud solution and how you can benefit from it, then I would advise starting with it first — Fraud: to pay or not to pay? – Brand new feature by RedTrack. 
2018 has been a year of botnets. And as a reasoned outcome, many marketers started to require transparent reports from networks, agencies, and affiliates they work with. 
At RedTrack we work hard in order to provide the solution that would timely respond to all the market challenges. With this in mind, we contacted our longtime partner FraudScore, an ultimate fraud detection tool, and started negotiating closer cooperation between our platforms. As a result, great expertise and technologies of FraudScore in detecting and fighting fraud, and advanced feature-set combined with a user-friendly interface of RedTrack, have translated into Fraud Report.

Now, with Fraud Report, RedTrack users can receive a holistic overview of the traffic they buy in real-time and have in-depth fraud reporting within their RedTrack accounts.
&nbsp;

In this article, we’d like to focus more on the technologies used in the Fraud Report and how big the problem of fraud traffic is, in general. To that end, we grabbed the questions and addressed them to Dmitry Isakov, CEO of FraudScore. Keep on reading our interview with Dmitry, and find out how to save your ad campaigns and your advertising investments in the age of fraud explosion. 

&nbsp;

Dmitry, you're engaged in the ""fight with the dark side"" of online advertising for a while now. In your opinion, how big of a problem is digital ad fraud? 

I would say that ad fraud is one of the most important and complex challenges that marketers face these days.
&nbsp;
Digital ad spend is rising every year, from $93 billion in 2018 to estimated $105 billions in 2019. And around 65% of marketing budgets are spent on mobile advertising.
&nbsp;
If we take a look at FraudScore statistics for 2018 - 22% of global ad traffic, both mobile and web, was fraudulent.
&nbsp;

[caption id=""attachment_3182"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""600""] Image source: https://fraudscore.ai/blog/results-2018[/caption]
The estimated cost of digital ad fraud worldwide is up to $19 billion in lost revenue in 2018. By 2022, that total is expected to grow up to $44 billion! So it goes without saying that ad fraud is a huge problem and it’s not going to just disappear, but marketers are able to partner with solutions to protect their budgets.

If ad fraud is a multi-billion dollar problem — is there still a place that is fraud-free? 


Every time an advertiser takes a dollar out of his pocket to run an online campaign, whether it is a programmatic campaign or click-based campaign or performance-based, with installs and conversions as KPIs, there always are guys on the dark side ready to steal part of this marketing budget, very often a really big part.

What ad formats / digital ecosystems have the highest ad fraud rates? What is the reason for this?


Ad fraud is a problem that has affected every part of the digital ad ecosystem, including desktop and mobile web, mobile in-app, and the quickly expanding market of Connected TV/OTT. I would mention the most fraudulent formats in this order:
&nbsp;
First, video ads. It’s the most attractive area for fraudsters because of money.
While video budgets are about 45% of total ad spend, it is tied to 64% of all ad fraud, according to Forrester! Fraud is found in video twice as often as it is in display.
&nbsp;
Second, Connected TV/OTT. As more money is being spent on video ads, fraudsters are turning their heads towards it. In a Q3 2018 study, Pixalate found that 19% of worldwide OTT impressions were invalid, because of fraud and technical malfunctions. So it is the next big challenge.
&nbsp;
And of course, mobile apps and mobile web. Even though these categories are less at risk than OTT and desktop video, mobile web and apps are still formats to watch.
If we talk about programmatic, mobile display inventory presents the highest risk of fraud.
&nbsp;
Of course, fraudsters go where the money is. And they’re also attracted to new markets and technologies, such as connected TV, where the ad tech market is really young. That is why I think we’ll see a huge shift in fraud scale towards OTT by the end of 2019.

Affiliate marketing involves a lot of players, like advertisers, networks, publishers, and affiliates. Does all of them are subject to ad fraud? 


If we take a look at the ads money flow — we’ll see that all the stages of it are prone to fraud. So basically everyone starting from advertisers, agencies, networks to affiliates and publishers are at risk of losing their money to fraudsters. Advertisers are likely to lose budgets by paying for fraudulent traffic. Affiliates and networks are losing money by getting rejects, losing contracts and advertisers. When a network gets a bad reputation or an affiliate has several sources that are suspicious — next time an advertiser would think twice to invest in such traffic and probably would choose another network. 
&nbsp;
So everybody involved is suffering. But to be honest, of course, the party who suffers the most - is the Advertiser, the one who pays money. All the other parts of the (supply) chain are more tolerant of fraud :-)

Well, it's hard to deny that click fraud is a big challenge for all marketers. But are there any evident warning signs that indicate that I run into fraud? 


Running online ads is all about multi-level campaign statistics. When you’ve just launched a campaign and it’s giving you results way better than you could have expected - it’s probably too good to be true.
&nbsp;
Of course, there are some basic parameters that you need to keep an eye on. IPs and if they are blacklisted or coming from datacenters; proxy IPs; some vital parameters of device\browser &amp; user specific information. These can be controlled by either in-house or 3rd party fraud detection platform like FraudScore. But unless you have big analytics and tech team I would not recommend you spend your time &amp; money on that.
&nbsp;

[caption id=""attachment_2988"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""700""] Image source: https://fraudscore.ai/blog/results-2018[/caption]

&nbsp;
Dmitry, I know that you've been working in IT-industry for about 20 years. Thus, I can't but ask what technologies do you use to detect fraud within your solution FraudScore? 


We use Unsupervised ML to detect new anomalies and suspicious patterns that might indicate that fraudsters have come up with something new. When something is detected - our data scientists start to drill down the data to understand the nature of each particular anomaly, to learn more about the source and to find the pattern. If we see that it’s a new pattern or scheme - we develop new algorithms and methods that shall automatically detect this new type of fraud. When the development is done - we upgrade the platform. It’s a constant process that requires a lot of time and expertise, but we have the best data science team and our technologies are known for fast-tracking new ad fraud patterns.
&nbsp;
It’s worth mentioning that FraudScore was established in 2015 and since then we’ve gained the reputation of a trustworthy anti-fraud solution. Our expertise covers both mobile and web traffic, we work with all types of marketing campaigns - from CPM &amp; CPC to CPI &amp; CPA. So we possess great experience and technologies that are all aimed to fight ad fraud and detect new malicious schemes that fraudsters develop.

Then, tell me please more about the feature - Fraud Report that your team developed together with RedTrack for their users. 


Together we’ve developed a joint anti-fraud solution for RedTrack’s customers that is aimed to detect fraudulent clicks and give users easy to read traffic analytics. The solution combines the FraudScore click scoring platform and wraps it with a user-friendly fraud report inside of RedTrack platform. So from now on, every RedTrack customer is able to have its traffic checked for fraud without the need to log in to FraudScore, set up integration and send clicks for analysis.
&nbsp;
Our solution guarantees that RedTrack customers shall now have all the FraudScore platform updates, new releases and improvements of fraud detection technologies automatically.
&nbsp;



&nbsp;
Users are now able to analyze fraudulent clicks divided by types of fraud, campaigns, sources. Various slices and modes enable advertisers to analyze traffic, understand fraud reasons and make informed decisions on whether to reject or block it. RedTrack users now get a professional fraud report that gives vast opportunities for analysis and reliable data for further business decisions.
&nbsp;
This solution allows RedTrack to be one of a very few ad tracking solutions that provide a professional anti-fraud solution for their customers within their own platform. Our combined efforts shall protect RedTrack’s customers from losing money.

To your mind, what are the most apparent benefits of the Fraud Report?


1. Pay only for real clicks – don’t buy a new car for a guy, you even don’t know.
&nbsp;
2. FraudScore is an independent anti-fraud solution. In fraud detection – it’s vital that traffic is checked by a company who has no affiliation with other industry players and shall give an unbiased traffic audit while keeping your data safe.
&nbsp;
3. Reliable, comprehensive and detailed report. Our joint feature is devoted to one task – make fraud detection easy and effective. The report combines both marketing parameters of a campaign and FraudScore fraud categories within RedTrack platform.
&nbsp;
4. Constant updates and improvements. FraudScore data science team and their machine learning algorithms are constantly working on finding out new malicious schemes. And advanced integration with RedTrack allows us to keep all the updates available for RedTrack customers asap.

5. All-Inclusive. RedTrack is a unique company who made great efforts to provide its customers with a convenient and reliable fraud detection solution right in their platform. Advertisers are now able to have all the data for their campaign efficacy and detected suspicious clicks in RedTrack interface. I think that it shows how serious RedTrack is about the safety of their customers and we are sure that our joint solution is the best way to save your time and money.

3274,Introduction to the Dating Vertical [+ expert opinion],"In the ever-changing landscape of affiliate marketing, it can be hard to truly follow all the trends and know what works — and more importantly, what doesn’t. Some verticals and niches become more popular. Others make it almost impossible to make good profit with after a while. 
But why reinvent the wheel? There are certain verticals that stay afloat even when others are crashing. Dating is one of those verticals. Why? It’s easy — people never stop dating. 
When the most romantic season is approaching, isn’t it a high time to get into dating offers and make some profit? To help you get started, we’ve prepared a comprehensive dating vertical guide. 
We have also added a bonus section to this article — an interview with the affiliate network that is absolutely killing the dating industry. TopOffers is a premium CPA network that offers exclusively dating offers. Read on to get plenty of great insights shared from a network perspective (p.s.: you would find a welcome bonus from our friends from TopOffers at the end of this article ;) ). 
It's a proper long-read with plenty of guides and insights. No further ado…

What is dating vertical about? 
It goes without saying, that gaining a critical mass of users is the paramount challenge for any dating website. That’s the reason pretty much every single dating site has its own affiliate program. They gladly accept new members that you, as an affiliate bring to their site. And they're ready to reward you accordingly. 
Along with nutra, ecommence, and lead gen, dating is one of those evergreen niches that are here for a long long time. Among other things, it’s due to the enormous volumes of traffic and converting geos available.
There are a lot of questions you should ask yourself when working with dating vertical. First thing first — would you rather promote Mainstream or Adult dating offers?
Mainstream offers refer to dating websites/apps, where people try to find their match based on certain common interests and values. For ex., apps like Tinder, or Tindog, a very niched dating site for dog lovers.


[caption id=""attachment_3344"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""700""] Top dating apps by country. Source: Ogury.com[/caption]
The word Mainstream is used to counterpart an Adult. Adult Dating offers are often dedicated to websites where a person can meet someone to have sex. In majority, adult dating offers have a bigger payment than mainstream dating. And it’s considered as one of the most profitable niches in affiliate marketing. 
Dating offers work very well with almost all ad networks and sources, except Facebook that doesn’t welcome both mainstream and even much less adult ads.

Payout models
Dating vertical has its certain specifics when it comes to payouts. 
The user conversion flow is similar amongst all dating sites — get a user to register, prompt them to complete the profile, and if succeed, to become paying members.

When running dating you usually have the following payout options: 
CPL (cost-per-lead) or PPL — payout model based on lead generation (aka, registration or data submission). 
To generate leads, advertisers apply the following models: Single Opt-In (SOI) and Double Opt-In (DOI).
— SOI. This is the easiest conversion flow. The conversion is count once the user enters their email in the registration form. This payment model brings risk to advertisers due to poor lead quality — it’s quite easy to make an error while filling an email/phone number in a contact form. Taking into account this kind of risks, SOI-model doesn’t offer high payouts. 
Why advertise with SOI? 


 	offers have high CR; 
 	allows to split-test different banners and landers even with a limited budget. 

— DOI. This is the next step from SOI model and requires a user to perform one more action. For example:



 	1) fill in the email and 2) verify it;
 	1) fill in the email and 2) create a profile 
 	1) fill in the email and 2) upload the photo

Once a user performs both actions, the conversion is count. In comparison with SOI, this lead submission model is more complex. Thus, it offers higher payouts. 
Choose the CPL model, if you just start working with dating vertical. 
Revshare — you get paid a certain percentage when a user purchases the membership. No matter how many leads (aka registrations) you bring unless they convert to paid members. Once they convert, you receive a percentage of the monthly fee they pay. The size of the payout depends on the advertiser’s or network’s conditions.
PPS (pay-per-sale) — you receive a flat rate for each paid member you bring to the site/app. Like with Revshare, the more memberships you sell, the higher the rates an advertiser will be willing to pay you. Payouts range from $20 to $100+ and depend on geo and the dating site you work with. 
Which payment model should you choose? I’d recommend split test each payout form, as you never know which one works better for you. If you have a limited budget, then start with CPL, SOI, in particular. These offers are the easiest to test and optimize. When it comes to Revshare, you should be patient and willing to invest quite a sum of money testing campaigns for several months. 

Some tips while promoting dating offer:
— choose geo wisely. If you decided to make money with a dating vertical, you have a big choice of geos available. Some affiliates start with top tiers, like the USA and the UK right away. The payouts are bigger there, but at the same time — the competition is really tough. 
Start with less competitive countries (e.g. Italy, Norway, Netherlands, Canada, Russia) and master them first. Once making profit — try to scale it to other countries and traffic sources.
— dating works with almost all traffic sources. Social, native, push — all work with dating offers. Yet, keep in mind that Facebook has lots of restrictions on the promotion of dating offers. Revert to other social networks for dating offers, instead. 
— check your stats constantly. As I said lots of times before, testing and optimization should become your mundanity. It’s important to let your campaigns run for a while before you stop any source, offer, banner, etc. The information you get with a/b tests is crucial when it’s time to scale your campaign. 
— work closely with your affiliate network. As I said before, the payout size, among other things, depends on the network you work with. Sometimes its size can greatly depend on the relationships between an affiliate and an affiliate manager. 
Choose one or a couple of quality networks, and work closely with them. Treat your AM as a friend and show them you're serious to make money with them. By being responsive to your affiliate managers, you can receive more support for your affiliate efforts. For example, they might share offer tips on how to increase conversion rates or offer you higher payouts. 
&nbsp;

With this in mind, let's proceed with the bonus section of this dating vertical guide — the interview with dating kings, TopOffers. I've asked Nick Martsenitsen, User Aquisition Lead at TopOffers, 15 questions about dating verticals. He shared with us lots of network insights, recommendations, and tips. With no further delay, let’s dive into secrets and tips of mainstream and adult dating offers.

&nbsp;
Nick, tell us about TopOffers. What distinguishes you from others and makes affiliates join your network?


TopOffers is a CPA Network that has been operating since March 2017, when the dating industry giant, Together Networks, closed their affiliate program and delegated exclusive rights to promote their brands to us. This provided the basis for the rapid rollout of TopOffers on to the global market. For affiliates this means – the better the traffic they send, the higher the payouts they get, with 24/7 support always ready to help.
&nbsp;
Plus, at this moment we are actively expanding into other verticals like Sweepstakes, Games, Crypto, Finance and VAS.
&nbsp;
Last, but not least, we have a friendly attitude to our affiliates. We like meeting them personally at the Affiliate Conferences and at our office. Affiliate marketing isn’t just about business, it’s a community of like-minded people who work together and have fun together as well.

Do you offer the translation of landing pages for affiliates?


Sure, all the landings are adapted and translated for every country. In addition, we offer different types of landing pages for each type of traffic: mainstream and adult versions are available.

I’ve noticed the list of top offers and rates for different geos on your platform — how often do you update them?


[caption id=""attachment_3338"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""700""] Dashboard from TopOffers interface[/caption]

We constantly keep close communication with all our partners through affiliate managers. Plus, we provide our affiliates with the relevant information and rates on the platform, so there’s always up-to-date information and news regarding new offers, verticals and promotions.

Since you see data in your network — what type of offers do convert better on TopOffers — adult or mainstream?


Talking about dating, we run both mainstream and adult offers in our network. It absolutely depends on traffic source and GEO. Adult converts better, just because this traffic source is good for dating offers. Talking about mainstream, there are wider varieties of traffic sources and types, so it’s harder to find the right one, but once you’ve found a great source, the CR could be much higher than in an adult segment.

Dating is one of the evergreen verticals. What future do you predict for dating?


According to Statista, the dating vertical is forecasted to grow 24% by market revenue and users in the next 5 years.


[caption id=""attachment_3341"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""550""] Online dating revenue in the United States from 2017 to 2023 (in million U.S. dollars). Source: statista.com[/caption]
Talking about innovations in the dating industry, we could add that matchmaking will become more accurate with AI technologies (based on user behavior) and the dating process itself will move partly to VR/AR in the near 20 years. Humanity demands love and relationships; technology helps to ease the process.

It is said that mobile devices convert better than desktop and tablets do — whether this is the case or not? Or it largely depends on the traffic type?


Talking in general, mobile traffic converts better. Traffic volumes are higher as well as the variety of promotions. People are getting more mobile and less static. Although, the Bounce Rate is higher in mobile, and the Average Session Duration is shorter. This is related to the different user/device scenarios.
&nbsp;
It’s important to know the target audience.
There are segments that play a more significant role in mobile than in desktop traffic. For instance, the OS version or connection type is not even tracked by the computer. And in mobile traffic, the type of connection, device model and screen resolution greatly influence the target actions of the user.

Is there any GEO (or tier) that works really great with dating offers?


Developed countries usually work better with dating offers. This is directly related to technological facilities and a country’s general purchasing power, so Tier 1 and 2 goes well with dating. In fact, TopOffers covers more than 50 countries on a PPL basis.

What do you think the secret of good performance of Nordic countries?


It’s a good question. Considering the climate of Nordic countries, we could say that these users spend a lot of time on the Internet and are up for any kind of entertainment there (dating, gambling etc.). Add to that the high solvency of these countries – you get the most attractive market for affiliate marketing to work with. In fact, Nordic countries are the leaders in Internet presence. 90% of people in these countries aged from 16 to 24 and 75% aged from 65 to 74 actively use Internet services.

What payment models do you work with? Any recommendations which payout model one should start with when launching a campaign?


TopOffers works with several payment models: PPL, PPS, Revenue Share, and allows benefit to be earned from any of the models mentioned. Usually, we recommend starting tests on a PPL basis, since it’s the fastest way to see how effective your campaigns are and to get profit faster (in comparison with PPS). Afterwards, we could individually discuss other opportunities for beneficial cooperation with each affiliate.

What are the top traffic sources to promote dating offers with?


There are a lot of traffic sources that convert well for dating. For example: adult ad networks, native, social, classifieds. Push traffic is also growing in popularity these days.

What to use: direct-linking or landing page?


Do you like visiting the gym? Let’s just imagine that you do. What is better for you: to begin heavy physical exercises right away or first warm up your muscles to prepare? LP warms users up correspondingly; it helps them to enjoy adult content to the fullest and return to our website in the future. The difference between direct-linking and a landing page is that in the first instance there is no possibility to be “correctly prepared” for the information.

Is there any secret of creating a highly-converting lander?


There are no precise instructions on how to make a highly profitable landing page. You have to take into consideration how your landing page fits all the requirements of the current audience, and by requirements I mean its goals and interests. It is important to understand and analyze all trends used by your main competitors in the present vertical. For example, speaking about mainstream products, there’s a trend that consists of using modest women’s looks, which helps to build confidence and trust among users. We can also point to high-quality and bright images as being one of the major aspects of any successful campaign.

Share your top 5 pieces of advice on promoting dating offers.


-          Creatives are crucial. The best looking banner doesn’t always mean the highest conversion rate. Test different styles and images to get your perfect CTR. Your banner has to be eye-catching and original, but the moment you create a great banner, be sure – it will be copied within the hour, so fast turnover of banners is essential.
&nbsp;
-          Split test different offers. Choose 2-3 different offers for your traffic source for the same GEO.
&nbsp;
-          Take less competitive countries. Such GEOs as USA, Canada and UK are already occupied with lots of affiliates. There are less competitive regions, such as mainland Europe, Latin America and Asia, with really high EPCs and payouts.
&nbsp;
-          Communicate with your manager. You can always get some tips and tricks or just relevant info regarding GEOs and offers from the manager of TopOffers. Plus, always build a trusting relationship with the manager of your traffic source.
&nbsp;
-          Test new sources. Affiliate marketing is dynamic. Once you find your perfect high-quality source, it doesn’t guarantee high performance every day, especially when you’re planning to scale. Invest some of your income in exploring new tools/sources etc.

Do you witness particular cases among your affiliates on how analytics and tracking tools affect their success?


There are plenty of tools that add value to our affiliates’ campaigns, such as competitor analysis tools (ad spy), market analysis services (web statistics), VPNs and trackers, like RedTrack.
&nbsp;
Trackers are just super important for all affiliates, because when you run many campaigns from different sources, you need a single dashboard to monitor and control all metrics. Plus, some affiliate networks could send delayed data, and sometimes a 2-hour delay can be crucial.

Thanks for the answers, Nick!

3397,Breaking stereotypes: is gaming vertical still profitable?,"It seems like gaming will never go out of fashion...
&nbsp;
Last year the global games market reached $137.9 billion. That's 10.9% higher than in 2017. Why is it happening? The growth of the industry is driven by extensive internet penetration, favorable regulations and constant emergence of new markets. Ten years ago it was children and teenagers who were playing online games. Today gaming audience has changed significantly. Various studies show that almost 50% of gamers are solvent adults. Sounds like the gaming vertical is a real win in the bag?
&nbsp;

The online gaming niche is immense. It includes a huge set of sub-niches. Affiliates can work with virtual casino operators, exotic online platforms, innovative software vendors. But may also choose more accustomed formats like boards, cards, racing, specific kids or adults games, and so on. The more choices you have, the better your chances to earn more in a competitive environment.

&nbsp;
Stereotype 1: Gaming vertical is intricate and difficult to manage
&nbsp;

No doubts, gaming vertical isn’t a super easy one. On the one hand, high conversion rates require creativity and strong analytical skills. On the other, this niche provides marketers with various products and services that significantly ease earning attainable commissions. One of them - affiliate networks. They help you to find publishers and manage affiliate campaigns quick and easy. Spoiler: not all of them are equally good. So, conduct a thorough research first to work only with trusted and secure one.

As to our new partner Ad2games, it has over 150 international brands in portfolio and 1500 live campaigns. Beside gaming offers, it can also provide you with high-quality traffic and serves you as a full-fledged traffic source. RedTrack and Ad2games entered into partnership to help gaming vertical newcomers and professionals overcome challenges of affiliate marketing:


 	find offers with high rates
 	make effective creatives
 	create campaigns
 	track and manage single or multiple campaigns


Games market is growing during last 10 years and will continue to grow in the future. Analytics and tracking are must-have tools for media buyers. I cannot imagine a successful media buyer, delivering high-quality traffic without them

Step 1: Choose Ad2games in the Traffic source tab



&nbsp;


Step2: Choose it as Traffic Source from the dropdown menu in the Campaigns tab



&nbsp;
Stereotype 2. Gaming vertical is highly competitive and difficult to start
Gaming industry is one of the best verticals to start. It’s rather easy to find target audience for online games. There are no special barriers for beginners. In A2dgames.com our only requirements are your real name and legal traffic sources. Each offer on our platform has more than 10 creatives for the most popular sizes. In addition to it, our creative department is always ready to help affiliates in creating custom creatives for their campaigns.
Peter, Ad2games.com



So, to get a successful start, you should think carefully about the payment model. We advise you to сarefully read about all of them before joining the particular network. In A2dgames.com there are 5 payment models that are available for every affiliate marketer:

 	SOI (single opt-in) —you're getting paid for every user that you added to the mailing base list with or without their confirmation.
 	DOI (double opt-in) — implies payment for adding users to your mailing base with their confirmation only.
 	CPP (cost per player) — a new player in the game - new payment.
 	CPO (cost per order) — you're getting paid for every user that purchased the game.
 	Revenue Sharing models — you are given a certain percentage once a user paid for the product.

 
We see that in A2dgames.com affiliates prefer to work with SOI payment model. Statistically, it has higher conversion rate, so it easier to start any affiliate campaign. At the same time marketing is actively moving from Cost per Lead model, where you are getting paid for simple registration in games to more complex models. The models where you’re paid for active player and revenue share model are becoming more and more popular

Stereotype 3. Gaming vertical isn’t a profitable one

Today gaming programms rarely require any purchase from the customer. That’s why earning commissions can be a lot easier. High rewards are usually made due to high volumes. So, the chances are better for those, who have significant numbers of targeted traffic, social media followers or email subscribers.

As with all competitive verticals, there are marketers who make a fortune and those who are not so satisfied with their financial results. There are various factors that lead to such differences in affiliates' profits. And to be honest, it’s almost never a vertical issue.


[caption id=""attachment_3442"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""825""] Source: wordberry.com[/caption]
Among factors that may reduce your profits are:
1. Low rates. Low commissions and short cookie durations are frequent cases in gaming vertical. So, choose wisely and think carefully about the strategy before starting working with any offer. By the way, client games usually have higher rates than browser ones.

2. Audience's GEO. Keep in mind that cost per lead in the CIS region will be cheaper than in the USA.

3. Low product's selling opportunities. The best way to understand if the game has market fit is to check how its competitor's doing, search popularity and the quality of the game itself.

4. Fraud traffic. In 2018 about $51 million daily was lost to click fraud or $19 billion throughout the year. Can you imagine, how much is your personal loss can be?

5. Lack of tracking and analytical system. An essential tool to be sure you're not draining your budget. Think -Test - Implement- Check - Analyze and all over again.

6. Poor promotion techniques. There are various promotion techniques that may help to promote your offer. To define which ones work better for your particular case, study competitor's tactics, search for statistics in your niche and experiment with split tests.
As to our product line, we’re focusing on desktop games and free-to-play games. But we also have several pay to play games offers in our portfolio. Based on the statistic, native ads and video ads were the best performing formats for them last year.
Peter, Ad2games.com
So, can the gaming vertical bring you remarkable profit?

As we see, absolutely. Thank you ads2game.com for breaking stereotypes around the gaming vertical of affiliate marketing. Great thanks to Peter for sharing his expertise and useful tips.",5/7/2019,https://redtrack.io/blog/is-gaming-vertical-still-profitable/,All|Industry
3514,How Spy Tools help affiliates make money,"Affiliate marketing is a rapidly changing industry, where you should always be on the alert: Google algorithm changes, data privacy issues, new regulations. At the same time, there's still an increasing flow of creative minds who are eager to make high profits. Some affiliates become threatened by a high number of competitors. But look, competition is actually good for you. It's a kind of indicator that you’re in a profitable niche. Besides, treating your various competitors with keen interest will prevent you from making wrong steps on the way of earning commissions. 

Whether you are an affiliate marketer, promoting different offers or a brand manager who is trying to put your company at the head of the pack, it’s equally important to know which ads are better and where to perform them. How to get this data when there're thousands of counterparts' campaigns in front of you? The easiest and most efficient way to make competition play by your side is to use spy tools.

Spy tools show you the choices your competitors have made to promote their offers: from traffic sources to creatives and paid keywords. Knowing this information simplifies the whole process of affiliate marketing, no matter how professional you're. Any quality tool is a saving grace for newcomers that drives them on the well-trodden road of success. At the same time, they're irreplaceable instruments for experienced marketers who are willing to increase their profits in a short time. And no wonder that the value of spy tools rises at times when affiliates lose grip or decide to master another vertical.
Is it possible to be a successful affiliate marketer without using spy tool?
It's definitely possible. You can find affiliate marketers who reach their goals with no tools and advice. But in these ways, we will most likely deal with a highly professional affiliate, a real pro in particular vertical. Or just someone with great luck.

To be sure you know how to beat your competitors, you should explore the following:

 	

 	Their products features
 	Pricing, quality
 	Unique selling points
 	Traffic sources they use
 	Creatives
 	Online marketing methods and affiliates specifics
 	Successful and non-successful marketing strategies.



So, are you ready to check all these manually? If yes, our hat's off to your endurance.




We personally could not have stayed away from these helpers and decided to uncover the whole truth about spy tools for affiliate marketers. To form an unbiased opinion, we did some tests with tools that spy on particular ads formats.

Now you would probably have a reasonable question, why we chose them and what kind of values can such spy tools bring to affiliates? Let's see, how they may help:

1. Generate novel ideas and campaign strategies 
No matter how long you’ve been working in this industry, there is bound to be some new creative approaches to promote offers that you might have missed. As a spy tool will help you to see how other marketers promote similar products in similar verticals, you’ll be able to keep up with markets and your niche and sub-niche trends, and practice new creatives you may not have ever thought of.
2. Reduce your ad-spend
When using a spy tool, you will see what kind of ads your competitors are promoting for the same or similar offers. You will get the whole information about

- all ads your competitors are promoting,
- competitor’s best ad combinations,
- competitor’s ad split tests,
- publisher sites that worked well and bad for your competitors,
- time frame in which your competitor performed ads.


This valuable information will protect you from spending budget on inefficient tests and ad mock-ups. Spying tool will help you to confirm or deny hypothesis about your offer promotion with no spendings.

3. Reduce time to achieve positive ROI

If there’s anything more valuable in affiliate marketing than money, it is time. If you decide to check your hypothesis with split tests, you deliberately put yourself in a losing position. You have to wait for several days to gather relevant data and make enough experiments with different angles and creatives. It can take you days or weeks via testing, while it’ll be minutes to hours looking through the results of your competitors’ hard work via spy tool. 

As a matter of fact, with the right approach, you may improve your campaign's performance in less than 1 day. As to particular services, we remained impressed under the performance of each one we checked. But we particularly want to highlight Anstrex spy tool.
Anstrex spy tool - is a tool for advertisers, content creators, direct sales marketers, and affiliates. It specializes in spying on native and push notification ads. 


Here are some of Anstrex Spy Tool’s top features that make them stand out among others:

 	
It provides you with more data than any other tool


In Anstrex Spy Tool you’ll find 15 Million Ads from hundreds of thousands of publishers in 92 countries. It’s integrated into 38 ad networks. Here you’ll find ad campaigns in any vertical, any language and in any country. You will be able to rip landing pages that your competitors are actively using right now, you can almost jump right to the same playing ground that they are in.


 	
Advanced Filters &amp; Searching Probabilities


Most spy tools utilize dropdown filters, which means you can only choose one at a time and you will have limited combinations. Anstrex has advanced filters that utilize Boolean Logic. This means you can create an unlimited combination of AND and OR filters so you can zero-in on the exact ads that you are looking for. You can search based on a combination of keywords, category, ad network, language, affiliate network, and country.

 	
Unparalleled Data Insights


Anstrex, in our opinion, has one of the most accurate data analytics from the creative all the way to landing pages. Whether it is the assignment of the ad-networks or determination of high ROI list of publisher's site, the accuracy of landing page URLs (even for cloaked landers) for that matter, Anstrex is phenomenally superior.



 	
SimilarWeb and Alexa Integration


If you want to know where your competitors get most of their traffic from, you would likely use SimilarWeb and Alexa or other tools that will provide with this information. But to get the full specter of data you’ll also have to pay for them and spend much more time on searching for the information and integrating it in the dashboard. 


 	
Let you download and Deploy Landing Pages


As we may see from reviews, it seems to be everyone’s favorite feature of Anstrex. It allows you not only view your competitor’s landing pages, but easily download them as well. 

You have two options on what to do with these downloaded pages. You can edit them manually in your computer or you can use Anstrex’s very own WYSIWYG editor. With Anstrex’s editor, you can even change all the outgoing links (including affiliate links) in one click. You can then upload it directly to the server that you link with Anstrex.
So, how to get the most out of your spy tool?
First, don’t make a common mistake and just copy &amp; past successful campaigns of your competitor's. Surprisingly, but such a strategy may bring you 0 profit or one that is far below your expectations. Just because you’re using ads and landing pages that work for someone else doesn’t mean your audience will like them. Look deeper into data your tool gives you and try to understand what are the real reasons for your competitor's success. Then you can use these insights to plan your own strategy. 

In case you decided to copy the successful promotional approach, try to improve it a little bit, add your own twists and innovations. And remember, you probably won’t profit immediately. Give it time and keep an eye on the statistics your ad tracker gathers for you.

To get this valuable tool you should be ready to spend some money on the subscription. Though, it's clear that this investment is minimal compared to what you will save over your campaign’s lifetime. As to prices, they differ from $49 to $299 per month. We advise you to start with a simple and clear plan that has core functions. Later you may upgrade your subscription if you see the need for this.

If you want to try these tools and see how they are in action, we recommend you to try Anstrex and leave the links to their products:

What exactly is Publisher Panel?


Publisher panel is a new feature in RedTrack that completely changes the way growing affiliate teams interact with their publishers.

3670,Build effective email list for affiliate marketing in 5 steps,"Some have buried email marketing hundreds of times so far. But was it justified? Well, in Hubspot 2018 survey, 59% of respondents said marketing emails influence their purchase decisions. While Digital Marketing Agency calculations state that emails generate $32 for every $1 spent and have 3,800% ROI.


Marketing professionals, in turn, consider email marketing to be the second most effective channel in their digital marketing plan.


Building your email list
There are 5 basic steps in the process of building and converting your email list for affiliate marketing. Let's have a look at each of them
1st Step: Create landing pages or pre-landers
2nd Step: Create compelling lead magnets
There are tons of easy offers that can be successfully promoted without any landing pages. But if you work with a complex product or service and it usually takes some time for people to take a decision for buying it, direct-linking won't bring you enormous conversions. In this instance, warming-up series of emails can help people make a decision in your favor. So, first, decide which case is yours:

Offers with opt-in / double-in payment model
If you use opt-in methods, you may stop your marketing activities after completing the two aforementioned steps. All you need is to make a strong squeeze pre-lander with an enticing sign-up form and an effective acquisition strategy. Sweepstakes vertical can boast of the largest number of examples of this kind, cause it primarily works through an opt-in flow.
Sweepstakes are prize giveaways where the winners are chosen by luck. Prizes can differ from stickers and branded cups to millions and private houses.



In this case, conversions happen at the moments users press the button to send their contacts to you. No more efforts from your side. You've already earned your money.
Pay per sale payment model
You see, you have to sell something. If it can be related to impulsive purchases, you shouldn't spend your time creating and testing various landing pages. You can find lots of less time and effort-consuming but efficient promotional strategies. But what if not?

Then, you can’t just kindly ask your audience to share their contacts. Of course, you may use some unethical or tricky methods to get them. But in the end, you'll have thousands of emails with very few chances that even 10% of them will buy your weight-loss or gaming product under the pressure of marketing. The more effective way to generate high-quality leads is to use lead magnets, challenges, and other valuable free content.
Lead magnet is an incentive that you give your landing or pre-lander visitors in exchange for their email address, or other contact information.
The most common formats of lead magnets are :

 	Checklists and cheat sheets
 	Fillable or printable workbooks
 	Ebooks
 	Spreadsheet and document templates
 	Samples of courses
 	Webinars / videos
 	Beta version

&nbsp;



&nbsp;



&nbsp;



&nbsp;
Emails as an additional channel of lead generation
You can systematically achieve high traffic volume but struggle with the conversion rate. To improve it, make several pre-landers (if it’s not prohibited by the advertiser, of course). They are smaller than landing pages and don’t require such broad and detailed information as landing pages do. It should be clear, concise, and appealing enough to engage users in your offer. 

They help you not only to increase your conversions and reason impulsive users but generate leads as well. You can implement a simple email marketing funnel, send promo emails periodically, or ones with bonus and discount offers. For this reason, additional opt-in forms in a footer on your website, at the end of your blog posts, sidebars, or email signatures may be a good alternative for pre-landers.
Creating email strategy that works
Now, with ready landing pages, sign-in forms, and lead magnets you should think about the method of collecting emails:
3rd Step: Collect emails:

 	Single-opt in option
Allows you to add users’ contacts to the mailing list with no confirmation
 	Double-opt in option
Allows you to add users' contacts to the list only after they confirm their e-mail with an activation link



There’s no unanimous opinion on what kind of option is better. On the one hand, a single-opt-in option statistically brings you more subscribers, as there's a great number of people who are unwilling to perform additional actions in their mailbox. On the other hand, the double-opt-in method will provide you with real people who are truly interested in the product you're offering. It'll definitely lead you to a higher conversion rate. Plus, your emails won’t go to the Junk folder in any case.
4th Step: Segment your list
 Segmented campaigns get 14.64% more opens and 59.99% more clicks. So, why not lose them?

Segmentation and personalization are the core elements of any successful email campaign. You don’t want to send emails with a special discount on women's sports suites to a teenage footballer. There is no perfect guide on how to segment lists. But there's a number of basic factors that you should consider as the basic ones :

 	Demographic factors (sex, age, gender, location).
 	Audience interests (the best way is to research manually or send a questionnaire).
 	Audience preferences ( use any open data about your leads that may help you to understand their general interests and preferences)
 	Subscribers’ activity (inactive leads need reactivation emails with bright titles and special offers inside, while active users don’t need any extra efforts).
Implementing email marketing funnel that brings you conversions


Let’s take a look at a simple marketing funnel. The main function of emails here is lead nurturing. Nurtured leads make 47% larger purchases than non-nurtured leads.



&nbsp;



&nbsp;

Lead nurturing is the process of establishing and developing relationships with leads at every stage of the marketing funnel.

As you see, nurturing isn't about aggressive promotion. It consists of 3 main stages: providing value, building authority and call to action.
5th Step: Launch your campaign

 	
Create value


Productive relationships start with trust. So, before launching any campaign, make sure you really understand your potential customer's pain and problems. Show them that you are aware of their true needs and provide useful content that is tailored to solving their pain points and your product. Don't be promotional at this stage, be helpful.

 	
 Establish authority


Now it's time to show how exactly your product may solve your audience’s problems.
At this stage, you may provide guides, success stories, testimonials. Don't push, speak to them in a friendly manner. Create conversation emails with a nice design. Polished fancy ones usually show weaker results. 


 	
Convince

Sales emails turn came. In this kind of email talk about the benefits of your product/service, show it off a little bit. Use cogent call to action buttons with discounts and special offers with the urgency made of:

- expiring deals
- a limited number of offers
- deadline-based offers



&nbsp;

If you're making the first steps into the world of media-buying and affiliate marketing, we advise you to check some basic tools that can help you test hypotheses with zero or minimum budget. For example, with Rebrandly you can brand, track and share short URLs using a custom domain, so people will not be afraid to click on the link inside the emails. It's a perfect tool for you in case you only want to know the total number of clicks to see how well your ad performs or make sure you'll get value for money. However, if you work with multiple traffic sources and need to get advanced analytics, you should take a more prudent approach to link shortening as some advanced tracking parameters can be crushed in some cases. Just test everything first.
Conclusion
Building a high-quality email list for affiliate marketing can take you some time, but it's still one of the most powerful ways of selling ""difficult"" products. It helps you to reach your audience directly, get a high engagement rate, and successfully upsell them. The core elements of any successful email campaign are valuable content, offers that your leads can't refuse,  and effective call to action buttons. To make sure you do your best, A/B test different headlines, images, copy, and subject lines. And always test your campaign on a small group of subscribers before sending it.",5/28/2019,https://redtrack.io/blog/build-affiliate-marketing-email-list-in-5-steps/,All|Articles

Tips for affiliate marketing conferences attendees
Сonference attendance in itself won't give you 100% results. Here we collected a few tips that will help you to squeeze everything out of the affiliate marketing events you're going to:

 	Fill out your social media profiles
 	Get a business card

 	Make a short-list of people you want to meet at the event. Make a thorough research on what they are doing and their successes. Find common points and formulate how you can be useful for them

 	Prepare a general 30-second pitch for yourself. Be sure to include your name, occupation and the answer to what're you doing at the conference
 	At the conference write down all the information you find useful ( even if you have a phenomenal memory, you'll forget it anyway)
 	At networking sessions concentrate on meeting those high-quality individuals which names you wrote down in the second paragraph.
 	Attend after-parties
 	Follow up all the people you met at the conferenceTake a look at other educational opportunities

3813,RedTrack ad tracker solutions to affiliate marketing changes,"RedTrack ad tracker is constantly monitoring affiliate marketing industry changes to provide necessary solutions on time. No matter how hard clickbait titles try to persuade you that affiliate marketing is dying, do not be fooled by it. Just look at this promising graph. Affiliate marketing spend will reach approximately $6.8 billion U.S. dollars by 2020. And it won't stop.


[caption id=""attachment_3814"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""701""] Statista[/caption]

The reason why people are worried about it is competition. But try to remember your boring economics classes where they said that that competition is an essential part of growth.

You’re probably asking right now if these numbers somehow affect you as an affiliate who just want solid conversion rate and high ROI?

They do. Quite a lot

They cause inevitable market changes. Some of them may not be so good, but we have solutions.

Change # 1: Fraud traffic is coming
Fraud traffic has always been an unpleasant component of affiliate marketing. The affiliate fraud volume is growing even faster than the affiliate marketing industry itself.

In 2018  the loss to advertising fraud was about $35 billion. In 2019 advertisers will have 21 percent more of this flying into the pipe. 

Just take a look at the statistics :

 	Advertisers will lose $42 billion of ad spend around the world in 2019 due to fraud across online, mobile and in-app channels
 	1 in 5 Ad Serving Websites are Visited Exclusively By Bots
 	Over 40% of paid traffic sources are generated by bots, automated clicks, or some type of click fraud.

[caption id=""attachment_3815"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1157""] https://ppcprotect.com/ad-fraud-statistics/[/caption]

&nbsp;

Until 2018, desktops were much more affected by fraud traffic, while now, this phenomenon has tightly settled in the mobile sector. Only mobile install fraud is going to exceed $13 billion till the end of 2019. 

We have to face it: every time an affiliate takes a dollar out of his pocket, fraud squads immediately start to implement their schemes on picking it up.

If talk in details, fraudulent activity may include


 	fake leads
 	spamming emails from a referral link
 	pop-ups and pop-unders opening behind the browsers
 	cloning other affiliate site’s content to steal away traffic.
 	auto-filling forms with software 

and hundreds of others


Affiliate fraud is a well-known phenomenon. However,  a lot of traffic providers are still not able to provide a proper long-term solution for filtering fraud activity. Sometimes you can’t filter it by IP on your traffic source side. And even if you can, there's no 100% guarantee that it will help.

&nbsp;

Change #2: market diversification and development


With industry growth and complication, there are more and more solutions introduced to affiliates and advertisers. With 81% of all international brands using affiliate marketing, there’s no surprise that most of these solutions are complex and sophisticated with enterprise-level prices in their proposals. They are implemented on a large-scale basis and sometimes may require the specialized tech attention or an additional employee. 



A wide range of features and add-ons are good friends of big companies which have a decent marketing budget. But what about SMBs? The truth is that many of them have very limited financial resources and simply can’t afford the time and up-front costs required by these enterprise-level proposals. Moreover, in most cases, they don't need even half of the features that are offered to them. Should they part with their limited budget and pay for some of the ""high-brow"" tracking and management solutions after a free trial period? Or should they continue to work in the old manner, performing all actions manually and losing their time, effort, and, as a result,  more money?  Sounds like someone is in trouble.

it is quite obvious now that the ad tech market is moving towards understanding the need for more diversified and customer-oriented products. As much of the audience remains untouched and unsatisfied.
RedTrack ad tracker Solution: Publisher Panel
From the very beginning, RedTrack ad tracker was focusing on small and medium affiliate teams and independent affiliates. It left its mark on our culture:

1) careful and attentive attitude to each customer

2) recognized customer care

3) extensive set of features developed specifically to satisfy SMBs needs

4) affordable price for starters and professionals

If compare with big companies, SMBs require a completely different approach and attitude. We always should keep our ears open to understand the newly formed needs and pains of our customers. It's another way of communication and interaction, which is faster, more trusting, open, and relaxed. 

SMBs risk is much more than enterprises. It's just a rule of thumb. That's why we feel a special responsibility for all our clients. We take their winning and losing to our account too. As our main goal is to help.

&nbsp;



&nbsp;

After a long time spent on the market need research, we released a new feature for small and medium-sized affiliate teams with a growth focus - Publisher Panel. We tried to implement all your wishes, guys.

The idea behind it is to expand tracker functionality and create a viable quality tracking and affiliate management solution with robust features and reasonable price. You can do media-buying and manage publishers in one place without workarounds. Publisher Panel relieves the headache of those who manage all analytics and publishers manually, in different tools, or have to pay more for enterprise-level solutions they can’t fully leverage.

Change #3:  Browser-based user privacy
People's trust in the advertising industry has significantly fallen after the Cambridge Analytics case. Many started to bad-mouth ad executives as much as politicians on the background of a dramatic shift in browser-based user privacy and third-party cookie.

Safari

Safari's Intelligent Tracking Prevention has already made a lot of noise in the affiliate marketing world. The initial idea back in 2017 was to limit website owners’ ability to track its users across domains, aiming at the third-party cookies that ad tech vendors (including Google and Facebook) place on sites. But with the latest ITP 2.2 update, it transformed into a full newborn anti-tracking feature. Now ITP 2.2. deletes first-party cookies that mimic the functionality of the third-party cookie 24 hours after they were installed on a browser. And makes sure that the companies are not using the workarounds to side-step Safari’s feature and aggressively track people around the web.

[caption id=""attachment_3823"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""866""] W3counter.com[/caption]

Google Chrome

Safari story has brought a lot of attention to Google Chrome, as the most used browser in the world. All quieted in anticipation of its long-awaited release of new privacy tools. According to the company, it will soon make it easier for users to block, clear, and control their third-party cookies in a much more granular way than is currently possible through the browser. On top of that, they are promising to restrict fingerprinting across the web more aggressively.

&nbsp;
We have solutions in place to help our clients continue to measure their advertising in accordance with Apple’s policies
- Google
Trust has become one of the top buying considerations. Building strong relationships with customers has become a #1 priority for both SMBs and corporations. On this basis today we see a huge number of services that help to achieve it. Among them are different CRMs, email marketing services, and link management tools like Rebrandly that helps users to understand that the link they are going to click is trustworthy. 

Transparency, openness, and efficiency are the main trends of today's digital world. With all obvious double-digit benefits, it makes some business models and tactics counterproductive. So, how to stay whitehat affiliate and not lose money? 
RedTrack ad tracker Solution: Postback URL Tracking
Post URL Tracking (aka S2S Postback URL) is a server pixel tracking that is fully independent of the user's browser and relies exclusively on the advertiser’s servers. It tracks sessions generated on clicks to attribute conversions and passes the transaction ID to RedTrack.

It's not only the Safari reason that makes S2S Postbacks attractive for affiliates. It has several undeniable advantages over Tracking Pixels:

 	It's a more accurate method for tracking conversions. As it's server-side, there is less randomness in results
 	Users can't affect the tracking process by deleting their cookies In any browser
 	It less prone to fraud and has a wide range of  to mitigate fraud
 	are various options to prevent postback fraud.

RedTrack enables tracking of 2 conversion events: conversions and transactions. 

We tried to make the implementation process as easy as possible. You can find your S2S and pixel templates in your RedTrack account. Just choose ""Conversion tracking"" in your ""Tools"" bar. If you want to track your conversions automatically, with Affiliate Networks firing your conversions on their sides,  you will need to setup Postback URL.

&nbsp;


Change #4: SaaS products rise
More and more businesses prefer SaaS solutions to self-hosted ones. 

&nbsp;

[caption id=""attachment_3842"" align=""alignnone"" width=""600""] atlantic.net[/caption]

&nbsp;

Choosing a SaaS ad tracker over a self-hosted one, you choose a software and service rent on a monthly or yearly subscription basis.

With this they get



 	 Lower price
 	 Less technical requirements
 	 Quick and effective technical support (including updates and bug fixes)
 	 Specialized data center services
 	 Automated backups
 	 Easy exit option
 	 IT infrastructure and services outsourced.
 	 Accessibility over internet

RedTrack ad tracker Solution: cloud-hosted ad-tracker with an extensive set of features and clean interface
When it comes to making an ad tracker choice, it's better to think from a long-term perspective - which solution will be the most accessible, secure, and valuable one. Based on these points we created RedTrack - a cloud-hosted ad tracking software to manage and analyze ad campaigns.

RedTrack lets you focus exclusively on your business. You don't have to worry about keeping your technology running, managing your own databases, or being afraid of overcharging. You don’t need to hassle with servers or geo balancing. Everything is handled by RedTrack. Thanks to our business model, we are able to provide impeccable support to our clients and quickly implement necessary changes in their accounts at their request. It also makes it possible to involve your whole team in the process of tracking to have better control over ad campaign performance. You can define the access level for each team member (view, edit, export) or the affiliate as well as limit access to financial data or a particular Network or Source.

We are constantly improving our product and adding new features. Only in the last 3 months, we released 2 big long-awaited solutions to our clients: Fraud Report and Publisher Panel. And you could have immediately seen them in your workspace and started using them in the next second after release. With no additional downloads, updates, software, or add-ons. 

&nbsp;
Change # 5: Process automation
Effective affiliate marketing is driven by data. We sometimes hear that clicks and costs are the only useful metrics in affiliate marketing that you need to make good decisions. In fact, they don’t give you the whole picture, and apart from the rest important ones, most often lead to erroneous conclusions. 

The ultimate goal of any affiliate is to get a high ROI, not to pump over conversion rate. Investing100$ should bring you the amount increased several times. This is what business is about, right? Then you should be ready to do much more ad tracking tasks.

You see how people delegate all their routine and data-related tasks to machines. Affiliates, in their turn, rely on ad trackers. If you track and manage your ads using a bunch of simple workarounds, or by hand, don't be surprised by mistakes: mathematical, tactical, and strategic ones. 


RedTrack ad tracker Solution : 3 in 1 product
RedTrack ad tracker was designed specifically to ease the affiliates' lives. It collects a large amount of data, analyzes it, and represents it without any delays.

 	Please, can you suggest me any other good traffic source with not many bots?  - affiliatefix.com

&nbsp;

Currently, there are more than 30 different ad formats ( including subformats). Tough choice, isn’t it?  Fortunately or not, it's limited by several factors: ad network specifics and offers settings. Some ad networks may specialize exclusively in one ad format: desktop banners or mobile pop traffic, for example. While some advertisers may put severe restrictions on ad formats/traffic sources available for their offers promotion. 

So, it’s certainly reasonable to make thorough field research before starting building the campaigns:

1. Investigate the market and make a list of trustworthy ad networks with their capabilities and offers.
2. Find data on how effective is the combination of your chosen vertical and ad format.
3. Make sure you have several promotion strategies to test.

In this article, you'll learn:
1. Overview of key digital ad formats:

Digital ad formats
All ad formats can be divided into two big categories: mobile ad formats and desktop ad formats. 

Mobile ad formats:  pops (popunder &amp; popup), redirect, instant message, push notifications, interstitial ads, native ads, banners, rich media ads, video ads, expandable ads, in-video ads, in-stream video, zero-click, widgets, search, overlays, etc.

Desktop ad formats: desktop web ads, video ads, banner ads, native ads, rich media ads, widgets, redirects. etc. 

Сurrently, we all can observe an increase in mobile traffic share in the affiliate marketing industry.



According to IAB survey, mobile ad formats expenditures grow by 36% yearly. if in 2017 global mobile advertising spending made up $107 billion, then in 2019 it will be around $198 billion, won't it?

Does this rise mean better conversions? Our experts will tell. 

But first, let's focus on the most important things: ad formats themselves. Let's start with classic banners, pop-unders, push notifications, native ads, and pre-roll videos. 

&nbsp;
Banner ad
The banner ad is still one of the most popular and widely-used ad format to monetize traffic. 

How they can be used?

 	

 	directly placed on the website or landing page
 	as an author box in the blog
 	in email campaigns
 	thank you or post-opt-in pages
 	in-between

The best-performing verticals: well, all of them




Banner Size
The most popular banner sizes are: 

 	

 	

 	300×250 – medium rectangle
 	125×125 – square button





As to other popular sizes


Banner ad effectiveness

(appromter research)
Quality: Average
User Experience impact: Low
Average CTR: 1-3%
Average CR: 2-6%
Average eCPM: $1-3 

&nbsp;
Pop-under 
A pop-under is an elegant version of pop-up ads. It's a webpage which opens in a new window/tab under users' current browsing window. 



The best-performing verticals: coupons, pin submits, gambling, adult and dating, betting, sweepstakes, finance, gambling, software and all kind of entertainment products.

The user journey may develop in several scenarios with pop-unders.

First, a user clicks on special links at 3-rd party websites and gets on your pop-under

1. then the user is redirected to main landing page or advertiser's website

2. or redirected to a pre-lander where he can get compelling information about the offer, leave his contacts or go to another website. 

The second kind of a pre-lander may include a deadline, strong CTA, lead magnets or prize announcement. Which way is better for you? Split-tests will tell.
Examples of pop-unders:


&nbsp;


Pop-under main advantages:

 	much less intrusive and distracting than most of ad formats. 
 	maintains the integrity of your website and you will never lose visitors.
 	insensitive to ad blocker
 	mobile-friendly ads that don't force user to download apps


&nbsp;
Native ad
The idea behind this ad format is to match an ad with the surrounding context. It integrates into the environment and may look like a regular social media post or Google search result. What's more important, native ads allow to interact with users on a deeper level and get better engagement.  

The best-performing verticals: works well with all verticals, but the best results are with automotive, travel, health &amp; fitness, and finance &amp; insurance niches
Types of Native Ads (IAB) :


 	

 	in-feed advertisements — appear in the “content buffet” on news, editorial sites, and social media platforms.
 	paid search advertisement — appear in search results
 	recommendation advertisement — appear as a recommendation in a special section based on what you search, read, watch, or purchase
 	promoted listings — appear in the liss of such websites as Esty or Amazon
 	in-ad with native elements — appear outside of the editorial field and contain contextually relevant content within the ad, links to an offsite page
 	custom solutions





Native ad main advantages:

 	

 	Effectively captures consumer attention
People view native ads 53% more often than banner ads. They check native ads out 4.1 times per session on average, versus 2.7 times for banners with 18% higher purchase intent compared to a banner ad

 	Shareable
Native ads take the form of valuable and contextually significant content
 	Helps to build relationships with users

 	Increases the reach of the ads significantly
It's easily deployed across devices including desktop, tablets, or smartphones. 



Native ad effectiveness
Quality: Above average
User Experience impact: Medium
Average CTR: 0.5-5%
Average CR: 1.5-4%
Average eCPM: $2-4

&nbsp;
Push notifications
Push notifications are alert-style messages that appear on your web browser page or in the app. 
In a web browser, you can see them at the top or bottom-right corner, while in the app you'll see them at the center of your screen. 
Types of  push- notifications:

 	

 	In-app push notifications (sent directly from the apps)
 	Web push notifications (delivered in web browsers or to the home screen of your smartphone)



A user journey map looks like this:

 	

 	A user comes to the website, sees a popup asking if he wants to receive notifications
 	User agree or disagree with the offer
 	In a positive case, he's automatically added to the list





According to Localytics research on audience preferences, regarding push notifications,

43% of users want to see a special offer based on their preferences, 
35%  - breaking news alert
34% - new content personalized to his or her preferences
34% - a special offer based on users' location


The best-performing verticals: eCommerce, travel, finance, coupons/vouchers, apps, video streaming, health&amp;beauty 


What to remember about push-notification:


 	

 	unavailable on iOS
 	Doesn't work with direct linking  (create a landing page for your offer)
 	High CTR doesn’t always lead to a high CR
 	Rising competition
 	More high paying bid 



Push-notifications effectiveness
Average click rate  is of 7.8% (4.9% on iOS, 10.7% on Android)
Click rates are the highest on Tuesdays - 8.4%.
Click rate is higher in non-working hours.
The highest average click rate is at its maximum at 11 pm - 11.4%. 

&nbsp;
Pre roll-video
A pre-roll ad is a video that's automatically playing before your featured video. These ads are typically 5, 15, 30, or 60 seconds long.



We know, sometimes they are annoying. We also know that most people don't like them at all. But. Who told they are ineffective or can't be engaging? 

Effective pre-roll videos are always about providing value in a short time. If you have a long, intricate message, pre-roll ads are not the place/time to share them. Pre-roll is about generating a click, not an impression. So, the worst things you can do with your pre-roll videos are:

 	

 	long sophisticated narration
 	cuttings from a commercial or just copying






You should deliver your key message in the first five seconds when your video is unskippable. Feature your message after those first five seconds and you won’t maximize exposure for your marketing message.
Pre-roll video main advantages

 	

 	Interactivity

 	Brand awareness
As pre-roll ad is unmissable, it grabs your customer attention anyway

 	Brand recall
In the group of 11,338 people, 65% skipped pre-roll ads, but 10% of the participants could have recalled the brand even if they didn’t watch the video from the beginning to the end
 	Relatively low level of audience irritation






Now let's see what our friends from UngAds will say about ad formats and what peculiarities have each of them.

&nbsp;
Trends
- Do Google ad-blocks and browser limitations influence the popularity of certain ad formats among your users? What do you think — should we expect more restrictions from their side in the nearest future? 
There’s been a lot of rumors about Google restrictions on some ad formats. During several last years, every affiliate has heard about popunder’s great collapse, because of Google new policy ( as we know Google wants to forbid some ad formats at all). But popunders are still alive and feel perfect. I'm sure there are a lot of ways to circumvent obstacles if they'll appear in future. So, don't worry about this :)
-Do you witness any trends/shifting towards a particular advertising format?
At the moment push notifications still show excellent results, but in the same time such old formats as popunders and banners don't lose ground. As always much depends on offers you want to promote, creatives and main thing - people's interest. Internet auditory don't like intrusive ads, but native ads - the thing that is not annoying user's eyes and it's the first step to your leads.
Recommendations

-What ad format(s) is/are most newbie-friendly to your mind? Could you share some pieces of advice — how to start working with them.
There’s no such simple answer to your question. It much depends on the chosen offer. At the beginning, we advise not to work with offers that need complex conversions (various CPA offers). We advise to all our newcomers not to give in high payouts. If you’re not confident in your expertise, we advise you to start with push notifications for collecting subscriptions. This is simple to deal with it and further to optimize.

Due to our statistics already long time push notifications prevail other formats in volumes and user’s interest too - but it’s really very popular and efficient ad format at the moment.
-Any recommendations which criteria should new users consider when choosing an ad format? For example, type of traffic or its volumes?
According to our statistics, the overall ads volume is more than 15 millions impressions daily. But it’s important to say that today volumes hardly depend on traffic type, as there are many sources for mainstream and adult traffic as well. The thing that you should consider the most while choosing ad format is the competition for this traffic.

It's not so rational to talk about the traffic volumes for each ad format that we work with. Just because they are changing every minute.
Tips on using ad formats
-Since you see data in your network, what are the top geos for each ad format? 
Let's leave a little intrigue and don't reveal all the cards right now - our experienced managers always glad to prompt you! But our top geo - America, Europe, Asia, Latin America, Asia, Brazil. As for formats - we have nice traffic volume chart on our platform, you just need to register to get access for it.
-Do you witness particular cases among your affiliates on how analytics and tracking tools affect their success?
Sure, but we constantly ascertain the fact that success is very often depends on experience, huge amount of practice and experiments with creatives, landings, bundles. Of course we know some outstanding examples when people get nice profit from their the first tries, but it's just lucky. Need to deal with big amount of statistics, know new methods and instruments, always be in touch with affiliate community and in this case you'll be on a horse ;)
-It is said that mobile devices convert better that desktop and tablets do — whether this is the case or not? Which ad format performs better on which device?
Many things depend on offer, landing page, creatives, target, etc. That’s why it’s not entirely correct to say that mobile devices convert better than desktop. Every campaign needs to be optimized and checked every day or even more often to reach its best results. But, as to our statistics, pop-unders and banners have better results on desktop, while push notifications and pre-rolls work better on mobile.

4056,Automation revolution: new RedTrack feature-set,"Have you ever dreamed about a tool that assumes all time-consuming but important tracking and optimization tasks for you? The one that can effectively allocate your budget, so you don't have to spend long hours in front of the computer? Good news - RedTrack already took care of it. You can get it all with new automation and optimization features.
An Introduction to Automation
In digital advertising, automation is a certain technology by which a specific advertising process is performed with minimal human assistance. It's a workflow of rules composed of triggers, followed by specific actions.

RedTrack automation package includes a customizable set of 6 rules applied to traffic sources. It optimizes your campaigns, streams, landing pages, and offers with your minimal assistance. By taking all the calculating and redistributive activities on themselves, ""rules"" act as data-based automated ads managers, saving your time and money.
What are RedTrack auto-rules?
The release of RedTrack auto-rules feature is a step towards our key mission - to automate as many tasks of the work of affiliate marketer as possible. The first step was the launch of auto-update cost. And now it's time to scale.



A standard ad tracker can’t provide a user with full control over the traffic. But let’s see what RedTrack offers. Based on the rules you set, RedTrack algorithms can now automatically stop, pause or redirect the traffic flow once it reaches the target value or falls short of it. 

RedTrack automation features can work on the levels of campaign, stream, landing page, and offer equally well. Just set desired KPIs (EPC, CR, or ROI), choose a lower or upper limit and time period. RedTrack will automatically notify and perform a certain action once the KPIs are met or not. 

How does it work? RedTrack set the integration with a tiar of Advertising Networks via API. It ensures the following flow: you set the KPIs for your ad campaign performance, and once the parameters are met, the algorithms would automatically stop the traffic in both RedTrack and the Ad Network platforms. 

The following traffic sources are already integrated with RedTrack with auto-optimization functionality: Google, Bing, PropellerAds, ExoClick, Revcontent, and MGID. We keep expanding this list now. 

You can try how the auto-optimization feature works by clicking on ""Rules"".

&nbsp;
Campaign-level optimization feature
Automatically pause your campaign if it doesn't show the desired results

Set rules for your ad campaign, and If it doesn't meet set KPIs - RedTrack will automatically pause it. The best thing is that you don't need to constantly switch screens and watch the dynamics. If you have a clear strategy, simply assign all routine executive functions to RedTrack. Later you may edit, restart or simply remove them. Besides, receive an alert every time benchmark KPI is not met. 

The parameters that are now available as indicators of campaign performance and can be auto-optimized are EPC, ROI, and CR. 



&nbsp;
Stream-level optimization features
 1. Landing pages optimization:

If you use several landing pages within one campaign, traffic is redirected to the one with better metrics in a given relation. Now you could not only A/B test your landers, but control the traffic distribution while working with large volumes by setting weights. 



&nbsp;

2. Offers optimization:



With several offers in rotation, traffic is redirected to the offer with better metrics in a given relation. Like in the landers case, after setting KPIs and weights to chosen offers, you can be sure that the traffic is distributed in the most effective way. In RedTrack you may experiment with a great number of offers in search of the most effective. Start promoting your offers right now with our video guide.

&nbsp;

4. Stream optimization

With several streams on board, traffic is redirected to the stream with higher EPC, ROI, or CR in a given relation. Works the same as with landing pages and offers. 

Follow the step-by-step guide on how to set auto-rules for your campaign --&gt; here.

&nbsp;
Auto-Optimization features
Stream auto-optimization 
 If you're not sure how to work with offer weights within one stream effectively or don't have a clear strategy, you may assign traffic distribution to the auto-optimization feature. RedTrack will regularly check the CRs and automatically redistribute the traffic in favor of the offer which shows the best performance. Choose the frequency of auto-optimization and write it down in the field provided. And don't forget to include several offers in your stream, otherwise, it won't work. 


Follow the step-by-step guide on how to set auto-optimization within a stream --&gt; here.
In other trackers, this feature can be called as a SmartLink or a new AI-based technology, when, in fact, it can be easily replaced with several complex code lines.

Benefit from Rules &amp; Alerts
RedTrack automation features work 24/7 and take full control of your tracking and traffic optimization process. While you sleep, do your hobby, have fun or think about the conquest of new vertical, your ad campaigns are under RedTrack care. Even if your marketing hypothesis turning out wrong, you won’t lose your money - your campaigns will be automatically stopped. To stay up to date just check your inbox.

Automation features are already included in Pro and Business subscription plans. Optimize effectively, get higher ROI and save your time for more important things. You can read more about automation and get to know the solutions currently available on the market here

4261,Next level tracking: Auto Update Cost,"Tracking with RedTrack is moving to a higher level. A new set of automation features is coming to increase your efficiency and free your time for business and personal development. With a standard ad tracker, you still have a lot of routine and tedious tasks that you have to so manually. Let's look at how you get campaigns costs, for example. Do you still spend your time on it matching traffic sources and tracker's values? 
Auto Update Cost feature to ease your life
Auto-update cost is a new switch at the right corner of your Campaign screen that automatically updates your campaign cost. RedTrack receives the latest data directly from traffic sources through API. The latest information immediately appears on your screen and reports regardless of your payment model. 

It gives you an understanding of how much you spent on promotion within a particular campaign. Knowing your campaign cost you can easily get your profit, ROI, and EPC calculated. Currently, far not every tracker can smoothly provide you with this valuable sort of information, while not many have capabilities to get the data directly from traffic sources. In most cases, you have to manually enter the values and constantly switch between two resources. 

With Auto Update Cost feature RedTrack automatically brings your campaign cost up to date at the end of the day. At present, Google, Facebook,  MGID, and Revcontent are integrated by default.

4311,Affiliate Conferences from A to Z: Interview with Shawn Collins,"Only few days left before Affiliate Summit East in New York. Thousands of people will gather to share their virtual business cards, learn the last industry trends, and find new business opportunities. On the Eve of the conference, we spoke to industry pioneer, co-founder of Affiliate Summit, Shawn Collins about affiliate marketing events. When it comes to expert opinion, it’s hard to remember someone who is more experienced than Shawn. 

Read on to know


 	 What's the future of affiliate marketing
 	 The inner workings of the affiliate event industry
 	 How to get the maximum from conferences attendance

Affiliate conferences in retrospect
- Experiencing all the changes in affiliate marketing event sphere on yourself, can you remember significant turns in its development?

I started working in affiliate marketing in the late 90s. Looking back, I can say that this industry has changed dramatically. In 2003, when me and my partner Missy Ward made our first event we had to deal with all organizational and marketing issues manually. I remember myself sending  “Thank you for registration” emails at nights, stuffing bags for attendees and making very simple website page that stayed almost the same for several years. And all these things were workable back then.

With social media burst and internet marketing transformation, organization of AM events became easier and more cost-effective. In the early 2000s, our main promotion channels were print ads and publications, which were pretty expensive. Social media promotion, in its turn, takes less money but more time. You can’t go on top of Linkedin, Facebook, Twitter fast, but your ROI is significantly higher. On top of that more things have become automated, so now people can do all the things much faster.

Affiliate conferences trends
- Automation seems to be a crucial process changing the rules of the whole industry. How did these changes affect attendees? Have their profiles changed over time?
For sure. We should take into account that the definition of affiliate marketing wasn’t always the same. Over time it has endured significant changes and become much broader. Early on, our main targets were affiliates and affiliate managers. Affiliates were mainly people with some kind of technology background. They knew how to code (at least basic HTML), and some of them could do more complicated things like databases. In general, affiliate marketing was basically about content sites.
Then, with industry development, the term “affiliate marketer” becomes to refer to social media, email and search marketers, different kind of influencers. The audience of affiliate marketing events changes in line with market changes.
- Are they all looking for the same thing? What were their motives for conference attendance back then and now? Education, networking, PR?
In my experience, only a quarter of people who attend conferences pay for access to educational sessions. Networking is a goldmine here. People want to meet with the press, find new partners. Everyone wants to talk about their products and find opportunities for business development. On average, attendees have from 5 to 20 meetings per conference day. That’s why Affiliate Summit Exhibit Hall and the Meet Market are always the hottest spots with a pretty small proportion of people interested exclusively in education. 

Tips for affiliate conferences attendees 
- As they say, if your business comes from relationships, relationships should be your business. What would you recommend for affiliates to get the maximum value from attending affiliate marketing conferences?
My key advice is to do advanced work before the event:


 	Go through the list of attendees and speakers carefully, and decide who you’d like to meet


 	Do pre-networking and set meetings beforehand. Use the app your conference provides or any social media
In this way, you'll have much more opportunities to establish business relations than if you just go blindly with the hope that people you want to meet will be available. There are thousands of attendees out there and the most desired ones usually have their schedules booked long before the event.
&nbsp;
 	Leave some schedule gaps for a chance meeting
Life is unpredictable. Leave some free time for unpredictable meetings. You never know who you can meet at the elevator or at the bar. So, be prepared.
&nbsp;
 	Don’t rush with follow-ups
I meet a lot of people who send messy “It was great to meet you” emails right after the event. I don’t think it’s a good strategy. Just because people who you want to reach are usually slammed with thousands of other similar emails when they get back to their offices on the next day.


 	Be creative
The one thing that I did for many years and that was extremely effective for me was sending an old-school thank you notes by actual mail. It can be just a small text on a simple thank you card you can get from Amazon or local store. Assuming that you have their correct e-mail address,  you can pretty much expect 100% open rate with your hand-written self-reminders.
 	Be specific while reaching out
It can be just 2 lines in your follow-up. A simple “ it was great to meet you and chat about social media/influencers …”. The best way to speak up for yourself is to mention the specific point of the conversation you had at the conference.

Secrets on being a leader in affiliate conferences niche
- Affiliate Summit has kept on being an industry leader for such a very long time. What’s the secret?
I guess it’s because of the special atmosphere and treatment of all the attendees. Back then, my partner and I came to the idea of creating Affiliate Summit because we found all other conferences pretty boring. We wanted to make an alternative which will be more fun, interactive, and user-centric. What we definitely wanted to avoid is this steady corporate atmosphere. That’s why we constantly relied on people's feedback and adapted our capabilities to their wants and needs. 

In 2006 we had a Meet Market in Orlando (Florida) at the day of the World Cup finals. Our networking area was empty for hours that day because all the people went to the bar and hotels to watch the finals. If you don’t want to lose your audience, you need to be flexible. Our Las Vegas conference is usually held at the time of NFL playoffs. Each year we put a huge TV at the Meet Market and bars to take away any possible obstacles to Affiliate Summit attendance. 

The future of affiliate marketing
- What can you say about the current state of affiliate marketing industry and where it’s going? Should people take the clickbait forum topics about its quick death seriously?
All these headlines about dying affiliate marketing seem funny to me. I’ve been in the industry for 22 years now, and this kind of articles have been spreading around the internet since the 90s. 
As to my opinion, as long as there’s e-commerce out there, there are no threats to industry development. E-commerce is growing more and more each year and its growth has a positive impact on the industry well-being. The biggest possible threat is an increasing number of stopping blocks caused by changes in different countries legislations. It all started with US CAN-SPAM Act in 2003 - now we have European GDPR, Canadian new anti-spam law. Things like that will undoubtedly affect affiliates who work internationally as they have to adhere their strategies to different local laws.

A major reason why we needed the ad tracker solution was for compiling and sending reports on performance traffic to our strategic partners and to further our effective monetization of remnant traffic

- Grand Slam Media
The functionality of any good tracker has gone far beyond tracking itself. The basic task for any ad tracker is to effectively track different media-buying processes and provide users with quick statistics and clear reporting. But is that enough in today’s busy and competitive advertising space? Simply put, it’s not. Today, ad tracker is a full-fledged assistant, optimizer, and manager. It helps you with all the routine tasks and manages ad processes when your workplace is short-handed, and leads you to higher ROI. 



In RedTrack all of this is implemented along with:

 	Fraud Report that prevents you from wasting money on bot traffic.
 	Automation rules that will redistribute or stop your traffic if your set KPIs are not met.
 	Granular reporting with 30+ real-time data points for traffic monitoring and analysis to help you get the full picture, without sampling.
 	Partnership Portal for those who expand media buying into working directly with publishers or other affiliates.
 	Multi-user access and shared reports to organize work within a team.

&nbsp;
Why RedTrack

▪︎ cost effectiveness;
▪︎ advanced reports;
▪︎ insights that help to optimize and rotate offers;

4594,Multifunnel: Check the effectiveness of your funnel,"You don’t need exact numbers to understand that affiliate marketing is becoming a more competitive industry. Affiliates are still looking for high paying offers, but not as much as free niches in more or less stable verticals. Some start to experiment with black hat tactics. Others come up with intricate schemes to lead their website visitors down the “right” white path. 

The affiliate marketing industry is changing at space speed. Some tactics quickly become obsolete, and direct-linking doesn’t work so effective as it did 7 years ago. Today it's hard to reach financial heights not knowing how to create convertible sales funnels - a strategically designed combination of pages that turn a user into a customer. The subtle art of consistent marketing.

We’re sure you’re great in it. Our only concern is how will you understand which stage of the funnel works, and where you have holes to be patched? To understand this you need to track your pre-landers and landers separately. How? Just use RedTrack Multifunel feature.
What’s a Multifunnel?
&nbsp;

Multifunnel is a new RedTrack feature that allows you to track complex landers funnels and evaluate the effectiveness of their main collateral separately. This feature was created due to the numerous requests of our customers and fully consistent with their real-life needs. To try it, follow the following steps:

1) Go to Campaign Tab and choose Multi Landing option your Stream block:




2) Enter the required values in the appropriate fields:

Link from LP 1 to LP 2 (for the pre-lander): https://your.tracking.domain/preclick

Link LP 2 to the Offer (for the lander): https://your.tracking.domain/click
Improve your Sales Funnel
So, we have a landing page and a pre-lander working together. Let's look at each of these in turn. With landing pages, it’s more or less clear. They contain your actual offer or multiple offers which can appeal to different target groups. Groups can be separated by personality types, hidden needs or financial status. A multi-offer landing page doesn’t only help you adapt the offers to different types of users, but give the users a sense of control. They can choose.
As to pre-landers, there can be two types of them: pre-selling pages and lead gen pages. Pre-sellings are warming up pages that you want your users to see before the actual landing page. Lead gens, on the other hand, are used to capture information about the user:  name, opinion, tastes, email, or some contact information. Affiliates can provide some free valuable service or product in exchange for this. The information will then allow you to sell, upsell and create a long term relationship with your audience. 

Making effective pre-landers:
Pre-landers can be performed in different variations and used in combination with other features. The only thing is that they are usually made with an eye on some verticals features:
Nutra 
The main purpose is to show the real results after using a particular product. There are many ways through which social approval can be conveyed. You can use photos, testimonials, expert opinions, profound analysis of the product ingredients, and so on. 
Sweepstakes
Sweepstakes rely on a different strategy as they offer people the chance to win a prize. Again, this may vary, but the prizes often consist of a new gadget or a similar item. Sometimes, they also feature a timer to urge people to participate.


&nbsp;
Games 
The purpose of the pre-landing page: to show the graphics in all its glory, to make users interested in the gameplay.


&nbsp;
Gambling 
2 most frequent messages affiliates translate: 


 	gambling/online casinos/social gaming is easy money
 	it's not difficult to succeed in gambling/online casinos/social gaming. They are interesting and easy games that bring a lot of fun

&nbsp;
Performance Boosters 
These pre-landers often offer to clean up the user’s computer and improve its overall performance. They usually display a technical message about the computer’s performance and promise to fix the problem.


&nbsp;
E-commerce
In competitive e-commerce content is the king. In this vertical pre-landers are usually longer and more informative. The main purpose is it to demonstrate the value the product provides. To make a successful pre-lander you need to consider the following elements: 

&nbsp;
  1. Identify the topic related to your product and in which your potential audience will be interested in. Don’t talk exactly about something you sell. Talk about the situation your product can improve
&nbsp;


  2. Choose an engaging headline on the assumption of three main angles: competitive, beneficial, or inspirational one
&nbsp;



&nbsp;
3. An exclusive offer or free value
&nbsp;



&nbsp;
4. Make an introduction to the product you sell (use leading questions, buyer persona image, values, and how it can be used)
&nbsp;



5. Find a creative way to demonstrate social proof: certificates, media publications, reviews, referrals, ratings, etc
&nbsp;



&nbsp;
Conclusion
Simply put, your success heavily depends on three factors: the choice of the right affiliate marketing offers, understanding customer mindset and effective creatives. Multifunnel is to help you define which of your creatives work best.

4895,How to create a successful sales funnel in affiliate marketing,"Back in 2014, a provocative article in Harvard Business Review claimed the inefficiency of marketing and sales funnels. Indeed, today there’s a huge number of ways people can learn and interact with a product. Instead of following a linear path towards a purchase, users choose their own unique trips and journeys. Sometimes they skip several sales funnel stages or purchase the products being in the middle of it.

This inconsistency isn't marketers' or salespeople's fault. With loads of information around, you simply can’t track or control all the ways the targeted audience interacts with the products. They can read articles, study reviews, watch videos, consult with their friends, or accidentally hear about it in a line. You may ask: how, in that case, we can structure interaction with customers in the most effective way? Let's figure it out.

In this post, we’ll look into sales funnels, learn how they work, and analyze how to transform them if you want to increase your profit.


&nbsp;
What are Sales Funnels
&nbsp;

First, let's agree on what a sales funnel is and what role does it play in affiliate marketing.

Sales funnel is a certain path that customers follow before making a purchase. In addition to boosting sales, it's also used as a mechanism for warming up leads and convincing them to take the required action: leave contacts, subscribe, or sign up. By creating a funnel, you prescribe all possible scenarios of your potential customers' behavior and generate a set of tactics leading them to a specific goal.

No matter which business sector or marketing direction you’re specialized in, you should always remember about the basic stages of the buying process through which your potential customers will or may go. Linearly, selectively or chaotically. These stages are

 	Awareness 
 	Discovery/ consideration, along with evaluation
 	Intent
 	Purchase
 	Loyalty

This is a classical marketing understanding of how humans buy things. But knowing this is not enough for making money. In reality, the boundaries of all the stages are quite blurred and they are pretty hard to digitize. Let's see how it works in detail.

&nbsp;
Basic affiliate marketing Sales Funnel
The basic affiliate marketing sales funnel consists of 3 main elements:

 	Pre landing
 	Thank you page
 	A landing page

Pre-landing page
Pre-lander is a page that customers see before the landing page. It has several functions:

 	warming up potential customers;
 	getting off the unwanted audience from the landing page with a product offer;
 	collecting contacts and users personal info;
 	transfer users to the next funnel step (next pre-landing page/thank you page or the main landing page).

There can be various types of pre-landing pages. Some of them you can see more often in particular verticals and niches. But here, we won’t dive into the details and consider the most popular types in general.
Types of Lead Generation pre-landing pages:

 	a well-designed page with strong CTA.

It should have a good structure and be straight to the point. Simply sell the reason why your customers should click on the button and follow the path you've created for them.



 	a page with free valuable resources.

Offer free samplings, instructions, a book, a checklist or another informational product. The most important thing is that it should be of real value for the people you want to convert into customers.



 	a landing page with a questionnaire.

It kills two birds with one stone:  helps you get rid of the unwanted customers, on the one hand, and get more info about the target interested audience. You may simply ask their age, sex, or build a chain of questions to establish a stronger contact.



 	a gamified page.

According to TechValidate’s, 30% of companies that use gamification improve their registration CR by more than 50%. It can be leaderboards, progress bars, loyalty programs, or a simple quest. The secret lies in the ability to arouse human natural instincts: competition, exploration, and curiosity.



 	a certain prize page.

Pages that offer you to participate in a prize draw if you leave contacts are heavily used in sweepstakes vertical but also well suited for others.



 	a page with a sense of urgency.

The sense of urgency can be conveyed by time and resource limits. The typical keywords used to enhance the effect are ”now”, “today” or “latest”. For conversion rate, a combination of limited time for the special price works the best.



 	antiviruses/ performance boosters



&nbsp;

Some people are quick funnel lovers. They tend to minimize funnel stages and experiment with combinations instead. In our case, the funnel might look like this:

&nbsp;


Top 3 tips:

 	Always test different pre-landing and landing pages combinations. Test your hypothesis with minimum budget, use analytical and tracking tools, and compare metrics.
 	Pre-landing pages are more effective when they include a thoughtful copy: headline, body, call to action, and footer.
 	Working through combinations, keep in mind that the angle “what will change for the consumers with the product” is better than “this product is awesome and it does this and that”.



A thank you page
A thank you page is where you say thank you to your users for taking a specific action at the first stage. Here you can just be grateful for having your customers contacts or also provide them with the free valuable item they requested: eBook, check-list, video, infographics or etc.

A thank you page may be erroneously perceived as a formality. In reality, it’s the core stage of the funnel, the ""impulse zone"" as to say. It’s a kind of bridge where you start building trust with your potential customer. 

A highly-convertible thank-you page consists of 3 main elements:

 	A confirmation message;
 	A clear call to action;
 	Specific instructions on what a person should do next. Here you may want to move all the communication to emails.




To monetize your ""thank-you page"" more effectively you can place:

- an offer/affiliate link near the bottom of the page

- an affiliate link near the bottom of the page

- a tripwire*

*A tripwire is a relatively painless low-cost offer that that’s sole purpose is to convert an audience into customers. This small offer helps accelerate the buyer’s journey by letting customers dip their toes in without having to make a big purchase. Then, once they see the value in that product they will be more likely to purchase the core offer

- the list of your offers or one offer

&nbsp;



&nbsp;

So, at this point we have

&nbsp;



&nbsp;

To track several landing pages in one campaign flow (LP 1 -&gt; LP 2 -&gt; Offer), use RedTrack Multi Landing feature. It was created due to the numerous requests of our customers who use complex sales funnels and want to measure the effectiveness of each stage.
An offer landing page 
This is the page where you make money. Remember, that the best landing page is defined by the number of conversions, not by some subjective opinions and ratings. If you're working with cold audience, prepare your re-targeting strategy: ads, emails, and experimential urgency campaigns. 

Keep in mind that there's no secret sauce that will make your page high converting overnight. But there are, of course, some tricks that statistically improve its CR:

&nbsp;
Tips to create effective Landing Pages
&nbsp;

 	Catchy design with high-quality images and visuals:

Don’t try to hit the audience by demonstrating all the visual methods that you know. It’s better to stick to the concept of visual simplicity:

- focus customers attention on CTAs by isolating them from other elements;
- display and contrast key features and calls;
- place elements in a way that directs users to keep reading.

&nbsp;

 	Tight, convincing copy:

The formula is simple. If you don’t know what to write, simply answer the following questions: What product do you sell? What does it do? Why is it valuable to your landing page visitors? What should these visitors do next and what they should expect?

&nbsp;

 	Social proof:

There are several forms of social proof that you may display on your landing page. Among them are testimonials, reviews, case studies, customer showcases, celebrity endorsements, number of shares, number of customers/ users and others

&nbsp;



&nbsp;

 	Well formulated value proposition:

A value proposition is a clear statement that describes the benefits of what you are offering, how you solve needs and your visitor's problems, and what distinguishes you from the competition. The distinctive features of effective VP are differentiation, quantified value, and relevancy. When it comes to landing pages,  it should  be conveyed in the first 10 seconds.

&nbsp;

 	Video demonstration:


-  Explainer Videos
- Testimonial Videos
- Video Backgrounds



&nbsp;

But what’s important, first, make sure your video doesn’t slow down your landing page and it doesn’t distract users from your call to actions:

&nbsp;



&nbsp;
Conclusion
No matter which kind of strategy you’ll choose or how many elements will your funnel include, the key to success is to build relationships with users. It’s difficult to persuade someone to buy something from you if there’s no trust between you two. Especially if we are talking about expensive goods. Trust is a strategic investment that will help you monetize one audience several times. The rule of thumb is that it's always cheaper to retain a customer than acquire a new one. Some claim that acquisition is typically seven times more expensive than retention.

As you see, a basic affiliate marketing sales funnel inherently is not much different from the standard marketing one. It likewise suggests a buyer passing through all the stages of any buying process: from acquisition (ad) to retention. It’s technologies, instruments, and the external factors that are changing over time, but human nature stays the same.

To make sure you’re right in what you are doing, track all your potential customer's impressions, clicks, and conversions. Test, look for patterns, improve it and do it all over again. Without a doubt, it’s not an easy process. But RedTrack is always ready to help you.",9/27/2019,https://redtrack.io/blog/how-to-create-a-successful-sales-funnel-in-affiliate-marketing/,All|Articles|Industry
5041,Native advertising mistakes to avoid [+expert opinion],"The native ads industry growth came in 2016 and 2017. Nevertheless, the interest to this ad format has only increased over the years, as it has proved its effectiveness for both B2B and B2C market segments. Experts predict that in 2020 almost all additional native spending will go to mobile placements, which already account for about 85% of the US native display ad market. Interestingly, by the end of 2020, advertisers will allocate almost two-thirds of display budgets to native ads.

What are Native advertising about?
Native advertising is a form of paid advertising that matches the visual design and the function of the media in which it appears. It looks and feels like natural content due to its full consistency with the native user experience. 

The most popular types include

 	

 	promoted search results;
 	sponsored content, including social media posts;
 	in-feed sponsored units;
 	promoted product listings;
 	recommended content on the web pages of online publications.







&nbsp;






&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Earlier on in our blog, we've talked about native ads' advantages over the rest. Among them is the ability to effectively capture consumer attention, drive greater purchase intent, and strong viral potential. Native ad formats are often compared to display ads and content marketing. Novice affiliates and advertisers may easily confuse them with each other. To resolve any misunderstandings, let's have a look at their key attributes:




 Native ads

 Display Ads

Content marketing




an ad that fully matches the surrounding context

a paid banner ad
valuable, relevant and attractive without a direct hint  on advertising



soft sell

hard sell

lead generation




high CTR (in the range from 0.2 - 5%)

low CTR (in the range from 0.2 - 5%0.05 - 3%)

long-term “hard to measure” goals




works best for driving traffic to the website

works best for retargeting campaigns

mainly used for lead generation and potential clients warm-up





Having appeared in response to banner blindness, native ads have become the real engine for online business growth. With the spread of new ad-blocking technologies and restrictions on the use of aggressive promo techniques, it's seen as creative salvation for brands. Recently, native ads have been ranked as the top priority for B2B marketers when asked where they will focus their mobile ad buys over the next six months.

&nbsp;
Native advertising mistakes to avoid
It’s important to understand that native ads themselves cannot guarantee you success. We contacted our partners and one of the world's largest native Ad Networks — Revcontent. Read our interview with Katherine, Marketing Director at Revcontent, where she shared her observations on the native ad industry and commented on its specifics.  

- Katherine, please, tell us more about Revcontent. What is your core audience and what value do you provide to them?
Revcontent is a leading content discovery platform helping advertisers drive a highly engaged audience through technology and partnerships with some of the world’s largest news &amp; media brands. Revcontent's discovery platform allows the world’s leading publishers to monetize their audience by providing users with a way to discover news, media and useful products that are interesting and relevant to their everyday lives. We work with brands, media publishers, affiliates, and more. 
- Revcontent is known as the world’s fastest-growing native advertising network. Could you tell us more where this native traffic come from?
Revcontent recommendation units contain Native, Video &amp; Display demand and can appear in a variety of placements around the world’s leading media websites; primarily in-feed or below article. We aim to maximize user experience and engagement with higher revenue, publisher control, and audience engagement tools that provide an additional revenue stream to publishers. 

&nbsp;



&nbsp;

We work exclusively with premium publishers such as History.com, Sports Illustrated, Nasdaq, Heavy.com, Boston.com and more. 

&nbsp;

As a self-funded company in control of our own destiny, we’re putting ourselves in our publishers’ shoes and exploring how to do more (higher ECPMs, higher revenue, higher user engagement, more ad quality controls, etc.) with less (fewer widgets on the page, fewer ads in the widgets, fewer contract contingencies, etc.)

&nbsp;

Leveraging a new machine-learned quality scoring algorithm, Revcontent rewards the highest quality publisher traffic with the highest yields and revenue. By aggressively taking a quality-first approach on the supply and demand sides of the business, Revcontent’s tier 1 publishers have seen a 117% increase (and still growing) in ECPM since Q1 2018.  
- Investments in native advertising are increasing. At the same time, B2B companies are turning into native much slower than B2C ones. To your mind, what challenges businesses face adopting native advertising strategies?  
Many businesses overall can be slow to adopt new technologies. Some companies shy away from native ads because Native can be incredibly effective when done the right way — with user engagement in the forefront, powerful technology, and understanding how consumers interact with content online. 

&nbsp;

Brand protection and quality control is always a concern for publishers and advertisers — content recommendation sometimes doesn’t have the best reputation and is known for clickbait ads.



What is clickbait? Simply put, clickbait is a piece of content that intentionally over-promises in order to catch people's attention and make them click and visit a particular website. Clickbait usually captures users with a snappy headline, such as ""you never believe this"". One of the most common reasons novice affiliates make is the use of bad clickbait titles, such as



No doubt, clickbait is one of the best ways to catch people's attention. Various studies show that the most effective headlines are polarized. The point is that clickbait frequent use may ruin the brand's reputation and establish steady harmful associations with it. These are pretty obvious facts, which for some reason are often forgotten. 



- Except for clickbaits, what are 3 unobvious mistakes Revcontent clients make with native ads? Share some tips on how to avoid them?

First, creatives can always be an issue. It’s worth spending the money to test what image/headline combinations your audience likes. 

&nbsp;

Second, being overly reliant on a single revenue or user acquisition source is a major mistake.  

&nbsp;

Third comes down to user experience. A lot of publishers are stuck with only offering a single user experience. Consumers are wanting a personalized experience, so publishers and advertisers should be aware of the user experience depending on where they are coming from - if they are new, coming from social, search, paid campaign, etc.
- Are there any threats to native advertising ad format growth? 
Luckily, the goal of content recommendation is truly to add value to the user and help publishers keep the lights on. As new regulations and interest groups come into existence, we continue focusing on maximizing user experience and engagement with higher revenue, publisher control, and audience engagement tools that provide an additional revenue stream to publishers.

Native advertising compliance issues
The most influential body that regulates native advertising is the Federal Trade Commission. According to its special native advertising guide for business, “Everyone who participates directly or indirectly in creating or presenting native ads should make sure that ads don’t mislead consumers about their commercial nature.""



We won’t list all the rules, but would like to recall 4 ‘basic principles of advertising law’, which should be applied to all ad formats:

 	

 	

 	Advertising must be truthful and not misleading;
 	The advertiser must substantiate any express or implied claims;
 	Advertising cannot be unfair or deceptive;
 	Any disclosures necessary to make an ad accurate must be clear and conspicuous. 





To avoid the disclosure problem, pay attention to the location of the disclosure and its proximity to the claim, whether the consumer can avoid seeing the disclosure. whether there any distractions on the page that might overshadow disclosure, and others, whether its language is understandable to the intended audience. 
Key takeaways for native advertising
1. Pay attention to performance metrics. Impressions shouldn't be your key metric for native ads efficiency estimates. Wide media coverage may easily result in a low engagement rate, which is a serious threat to the whole sales funnel. Don't forget that social media algorithms treat engagement. The more engagement your ad gets, the more chances that it will be naturally promoted by the algorithms. The convertible content is the one that resonates at the individual level, provokes conversation and encourages them to learn more about the product.

2. Adopt an ad strategy. Keep in mind that buying ad placement in any online media you should make your brand stand out not only among your direct and indirect competitors but the whole editorial and sponsored content of this particular media as well.

3. Make strong CTA. According to Hubspot report,  targeted calls-to-action perform 202% better than generic ones. Keep in mind different levels of involvement require different CTAs. Don't try to sell the product before telling your audience its competitive advantages and the real value it will bring to customers. Native advertising works best when scaling top-funnel content, while mid-and bottom-funnel content is better broadcasted with display and PPC ads. 

4. B2B and B2C require different native creative strategies. B2B native ads strategy isn't about entertaining but creating meaningful connections with the target audience. You need to demonstrate your expertise, skills, and show how business can benefit from spending their time and money on your brand. As to particular traffic sources, Twitter, Linkedin, and Facebook are still considered to be the best platforms for B2B lead generation with Linkedin showing the best results.

5265,Browsers' policies updates. Should we forget about cookie-based tracking?,"Google's cookie crackdown: are marketers ready to give up ad trackers? - Campaignlive.co.uk
The third-party browser tracking cookie is dead. What’s next? - Marketingland.com
How Apple's ITP Update Will Affect Your Innovation Ambitions - Thedrum.com

Starting this May, marketing and business media truly began to bury cookie-based advertising and tracking, foreshadowing the radical transformations in the industry. We were all impressed by terrifying titles about Apple's recent Intelligent Tracking Policy and its updates. But are all these threats to digital marketing real? Or just some clickbait tricks which make a mountain out of molehills? Let's figure this out. In the article:

 	the real meaning of ITP for the affiliate marketing industry,
 	the possible ways to counter the restrictions,
 	the role of an ad tracker in the upcoming changes.


- Okay, RedTrack. Tell me more about ITP and its key points
Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) is Safari’s anti-tracking feature that was first introduced in Apple 2017. The main purpose was to prevent cross-site tracking and shorten the life of cookies to 24 hours. Overall, despite the little buzz around it, the actual number of companies affected was not so critical. The majority has already used analytical and tracking instruments that relied mainly on first-party cookies.

Another wave of restrictions happened with the roll-out of iOS 12 and macOS Mojave in the fall of 2018. It brought users:

 	The removal of the 24-hour grace period and the third-party cookies' actual shutdown.
 	“Protection against tracker collusion” release that recognizes all redirects used for tracking purposes. It prevents cookies from being dropped or read on a users’ browser during redirects through tracking domains before they get on the advertiser’s site.
 	“Origin-Only Referrer” release that cuts off and removes any information after the root domain. For example, thebestaffiliate.com/snickers starts looking like thebestaffiliate.com.

Despite all the restrictions, companies still had a variety of solutions to track users’ activity with cross-site tracking via link decoration based on first-party cookies. 
Cross-site tracking — is a method that allows companies collect browsing data across multiple websites. The scheme is simple: when someone clicks a link from one website to another, the first website passes the special ID in the destination URL to the second website. The second one stores it within a first-party cookie and passes back to  the first website to record users actions.
And then Apple took up first-party cookies. ITP 2.1 warned everyone that it would delete first-party cookies seven days after their installation on a browser. In two months, ITP 2.2 simply cut their lifespan to one day. This forced companies to refer to different kinds of workarounds to store users’ information within non-cookie-based web storage mechanisms. Did Apple like it? Apparently, not at all. ITP 2.3 released this October aimed to eliminate those workarounds but re-extends the window to 7 days so long as companies use non-cookie-based web storage to hide the identifier. 



So, if Safari sees that a company classified as a cross-site tracker has decorated the link, it deletes all the non-cookie-based website data for it from the user’s browser after seven days in which he used Safari but didn't visit the site since clicking that link.

Seems like we are in trouble, aren’t we? 

&nbsp;
- Wait, I'm a little lost. Please, explain the difference between cookies types and how do they actually work?
Sure, let’s talk about cookies. There are basically three types of them: first, second, and third (ugh...yes, that's easy :)). We will not dwell on the second type of cookies as it’s just a name for the first-party cookies transferred from one company to another via some kind of partnership agreement. In this case, we are more interested in the first-and -the third-party cookies:

 	First-party cookies are cookies created directly by the website domain a user is visiting. They are usually generated by a publisher with JavaScript code. 

How does it work in practice? When a user visits a website for the first time and he sees a pop up (most often at the bottom of the page), explaining that to continue using the website, he needs to agree to the use of cookies. At the time the user accessed the page, the first-party cookie is generated. It collects all possible website settings e.g. the language, the cookie’s expiration time, the information entered by the user (log-in data, personal data sent via web forms, entries in search masks). 

 	Third-party cookies, in their turn, are loaded by third-party servers on publishers’ websites. They record the users' behavior and path on the internet in order to create their profile and display personalized ads on the basis of their preferences.

How does it work in practice? Let’s look at an example of an ad-retargeting service. Website owners put a 1×1 transparent pixel on their site. This pixel sends a request to the ad-retargeting server when the page loads and the server, in its turn, returns the requested information. Such an exchange allows them to assign a cookie to the users and retarget them later with the products or services they’ve viewed, interacted with previously or relevant new ones. 



&nbsp;
- Got that. Now, please, explain how ITP will actually affect affiliate marketing?
ITP 2.0 has brought about challenges for all digital marketing channels. Now there are very few affiliates left who rely on third-party cookies while tracking users’ behavior. They are fully blocked on Safari, which makes affiliate companies unable to accurately identify the sales that affiliates have delivered for their clients.

As a result, companies can't determine their best-performing marketing channels, affiliates are getting paid less as the sales are not linked back to their activity. Basically, it becomes almost impossible to make solid digital marketing strategies and plan marketing investments to meet business objectives.

You'll probably say that Safari is not the only browser in the world. And you're absolutely right. 
The Usage share of web browsers

Wikimedia


Chrome
64.92%
64.62%
45.4%


Safari
15.97%
17.62%
24.9%



The fact is that this kind of threat is coming not only from Apple. The whole data-privacy landscape is continuing to change. And this will certainly cause the emergence of new developments and sophisticated security features are expected across more browsers and platforms soon. 
""We need to think about all the data-collection mechanisms that take place across the ecosystem. We are making a number of upcoming changes to Chrome to enable these features, starting with modifying how cookies work so that developers need to explicitly specify which cookies are allowed to work across websites — and could be used to track users” — Google 
Chrome is now aggressive against “fingerprinting”. They consider it as a harder-to-detect method of user tracking that overthrows cookie controls. So, they are more focused on “reducing the ways in which browsers can be passively fingerprinted so that we can detect and intervene against active fingerprinting efforts as they happen.”

Fortunately, affiliate companies are mindful of this and already started to implement solutions designed with respect to consumers and privacy laws. As to ad trackers, the most secure and reliable solution for tracking today is the S2S postback URL. By the way, RedTrack was one of the first ad trackers which started massively implementing this method and made deep API-based integrations with affiliate marketing companies. The latest one was with CJ Affiliate.

- Okay, tell me how RedTrack can help me track my website users’ activity?
There are basically two methods you can now track your users: pixel tracking (cookie-based) and S2S postback tracking. The main difference between the two of them is that the first one uses cookies, while the second one has non-cookie-based mechanisms behind it. Is it worth repeating again, which one of them has the future?:)    






Pixel Tracking  

S2S Postback Tracking




The principle of work

passes information about conversion through the cookie of a user's browser
passes information about the conversion between the server of an affiliate network and the tracker through the link



Reliability

Being highly dependent on external factors, conversions are not always fired and lower the data reliability 
Shows less randomness in results. Can be used for verifying if there are any differences or distinctions in the number of conversions



Options for conversion signal

fires a conversion at the loaded thank you or confirmation page
provides broader opportunities to register successful events. Can register conversion after shipping an order, or a successful call (i.e. upsells)



Browsers limitations

 Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari has already implemented restrictions and baned the third-party browser tracking cookie
Is supported by all browsers across the web



Users limitations

Users use ad blockers and can delete cookies (clear his cache) 
Can’t be affected by users’ actions



Easiness

Easy to implement. doesn’t require any skills
Easy to implement. Need some basic skills



S2S postback tracking, or server to server tracking, is captured and stored at the client-server, so you can easily understand the entire customer journey and develop specialized attribution/compensation models that reward contributing upstream partners in addition to the converting partner. It allows you to save the identifier (or user ID) directly to the advertiser’s, RedTrack’s, and Affiliate Network’s servers. 

So, clicking on the link, in a split second a user is transferred through their tracking domains and leaves the information about himself to all of them. After the transfer to the landing page, the user gets the ID in his URL. Neither Safari, nor Google Chrome won’t block any information about users in this way. When the conversion is made, Affiliate Network fires a postback, RedTrack gets the signal and initial user identifier and verifies conversion. 

Still have questions about which tracking method should you choose?

5333,Things you should know about Google Ads conversions tracking,"Google Ads is one of the most popular Traffic Sources among RedTrack users. Why? Well, the answer is pretty obvious. It has tons of traffic, tools, and ways to optimize advertising campaigns. One of its main shortcomings is the high click cost. Of course, it is. You certainly can’t answer the question of how many users does Google Ads actually has, but by some estimates, it’s more than 50% of business around the globe and 85–90% of online business.

So, what opportunities Google Ads provides to digital marketers and affiliates? What does make Google Ads so popular? First, there's a great variety of ad formats available in Google Ads. Here are the 6 most popular:

 	
Search ads:


Search ads are the paid-for results that show above organic results when a user is looking for an answer or product. JFYI, Google has 75.2% of the search market, not including mobile (it's a lot, isn't it?). The ad may look like this

&nbsp;

 	
Display: 


Display Ads are those visual-based ads that you see while reading an article or a blog, watching a video, or do whatever you always do on the websites that are a part of Google Display Network. This network unites over 2 million websites and apps with a potential reach of over 90% of all internet users. 



&nbsp;

 	
In-app:


It all works as it sounds. The ad is simply displayed in Google's app-related properties: search, Play store, Display Network and other. You can target the specific app categories or select the specific apps, where you want your ads to be shown.

&nbsp;



&nbsp;

 	
Shopping:


It works as follows: you send your product data with the Merchant Center and create a campaign in Google Ads. Shopping ads use the product data to decide how and where to show your ads. And the variety of spots is really great:

- Shopping tab on Google Search,
- Google Search itself, next to search results and Google Images (separate from text ads),
- Search Partner websites,
- Display Network.



According to the latest data, Google Shopping Ads only amount to 20% of retail paid search clicks. So, there’s actually plenty of opportunities there.

 	
Video:


Your video ads will be shown to your users when they watch a YouTube video. There are several video ad formats that can be used: 

 	skippable in-stream ads, 
 	non-skippable in-stream ads,  
 	video discovery ads, 
 	out-stream ads, 
 	bumper ads, 
 	YouTube Masthead ads.




&nbsp;

Simply upload your video ad to YouTube and then proceed to create an advertising campaign on Google.
What do we have?
As you see Google Ads provides a truly wide range of opportunities for those who want to engage users with their product through advertising. However, using Google Ads itself won’t guarantee you excellent results. So, it’s better not to pull all the eggs in one basket. No matter how hard you believe in your chosen Traffic Source. 

Besides, one of the most important things that you need for successful advertising with Google is secure and accurate data collection. It will give you insights about your customers, their behavior and tell how to change the strategy for greater efficiency. It’s not that difficult if you have a reliable and quality ad tracker. As to RedTrack features, you might like the most, it’s reliable no-sampling data collection method along with robust drill down extended reports with 30+ parameters about every click. RedTrack offers a combination of several conversion types, statuses, and ways to deal with duplicate postbacks.

But wait a second. 

&nbsp;
What can be counted as conversion in Google Ads?
&nbsp;

Some people may get confused with the use of such terms as conversions, impressions, and clicks. In fact, conversion refers to any user action that is valuable for you. Most of the time it’s a sale. So,

 	Clicks are counted when a user clicks on an ad, link or landing page.
 	Impressions occur when your ad is ‘seen’ by a user. Basically it happens any time a user opens a website, a landing page or an app and an advertisement becomes visible.
 	Conversions refer to any user action that is valuable for you: sale/registration/ etc. You can easily calculate by dividing the number of sales by the number of clicks.

So, how are conversions transferred to RedTrack? In two words, it’s generated on the offer side and then it’s passed to RedTrack with the help of either S2S Postbacks or Pixels. You can read more about it in our recent article. In order to automatically pass conversions to Google Ads, you need to enable API integration in your RedTrack account. But you must be prepared for the fact that Google takes the conversion data once a day. So, the statistics passed from RedTrack will appear in your Google Ads account in approximately 24 hours. 

With RedTrack, you can now see all your 3rd-party conversions right into your Google Analytics account. 



&nbsp;

RedTrack sends S2S postback to your Google Analytics account based on previously recorded Google Analytics user id. Integration works out of the box with minor additional setup on the publisher's side. So, if you’d like to activate these features, please, drop us a message at sales@redtrack.io (and yes, it’s absolutely free).

Now that we have everything to start a campaign in Google Ads, let's see what tracking methods are currently available:

&nbsp;
3 ways to track conversions in Google Ads 
&nbsp;

With RedTrack you can track your conversions in Google Ads in 3 different ways:

 	Parallel Tracking;
 	Direct Traffic Tracking;
 	Multiple Direct Traffic Sources.

Now, let’s dive into these three methods. But before that you need to take three simple steps:

 	Activate your RedTrack account
 	Choose an Affiliate network and the offer
 	Activate your Google Ads account

All set!

#1 Parallel Tracking
Parallel Tracking is a relatively new method of tracking introduced by Google Ads. By this time, Parallel tracking has been enabled for Search, Shopping, and Display campaigns on most browsers. In the traditional approach, users click on an ad and are taken through multiple tracking redirects to get to the final landing page. A distinctive feature of parallel tracking is that it loads a landing page URL of an ad separately from a tracking URL. Tracking URL, in its turn, loads in the background instead of redirecting the user. 



By reducing the number of operations, parallel tracking speeds page load time and as a result has a positive effect on campaign performance.

When it’s better to use Parallel Tracking?
Well, actually this alternative method is suitable not for all cases. It can be useful only when you send traffic directly to the third-party offer and you need to receive postbacks with Google click IDs.

Basically, the only case when you really need this Parallel Tracking thing is when you use redirects, so the tracking link and the landing page link differ from each other. In other cases, it’s much easier to track your data using RedTrack Direct Traffic Script instead of Click URL. It will simultaneously track both clicks and views, so you don’t need to add LP views script to the lander.
What are the benefits of using Parallel tracking?
There are three main advantages of using Parallel Tracking : 

 	Faster page load speed
 	Better user experience

How to set it up correctly?


 	Ask your Affiliate Network manager if you need to change anything in your postback URL or offer URL to work with Parallel Tracking
 	Choose Parallel Tracking option in your RedTrack account with Google Adwords template
 	Put the {gclid} parameter in Click Ref ID field
 	 Set parallel tracking in your Google Adwords account

Follow the full guide to learn more.

&nbsp;
#2 Direct Traffic Tracking 
&nbsp;

Direct Traffic Tracking is a tracking method you can use when sending your Google Ads Traffic directly to your landing page from just one traffic source. 



&nbsp;

Mainly, there are three cases when it’s simply necessary to use Direct Traffic Tracking:

 	when you  want to buy traffic from a traffic source where redirects are not allowed 
 	you work with Organic Traffic
 	when you have low page loading or internet connection speed

The main advantages of direct traffic script:

 	Accelerates the process of redirecting visitors as there is no redirection-in-the-middle
 	Allow you to track all types of traffic that come to your landing page, whether it's organic or paid one
 	Every refresh of the landing page is recorded as a new visit.

How to set it up in RedTrack?
To implement the Direct Traffic Tracking method you need to use LP (or direct traffic tracking) Pixel. With its help, you can track events that come from both the paid and organic/direct traffic. In other words, this function allows you to send traffic without redirects, and get all the information like you normally do. If you’ve already worked with Google Ads, you know how much it loves to ban redirects:)

Basically, the only thing that you have to do is just copy &amp; paste RedTrack Direct Script from your campaign settings. To learn how to set it correctly inside your campaign, we recommend you to watch this guide:

&nbsp;



Or contact us at support@redtrack.io if you still have questions. 

&nbsp;
#3 Multiple Direct Traffic Sources
This method is relevant for those cases when you send traffic to your landing page from several sources. For example, you have a well-established landing page and you want to track your Google Ads traffic and keep tracking your organic traffic and keep all statistics clear and in one interface. Even though it may be complicated, in fact, RedTrack can easily manage all the flows with just one script that you can create inside your campaign in 3 simple steps:

 	create separate campaigns for all you Traffic Sources,
 	assign the link to a specific Traffic Source script, recognize and track your traffic sources properly with a special “tsource” parameter
 	add Campaign IDs into the script

Simple, isn’t it? 

We’ve prepared a profound guide on how to do it in our Knowledgebase as well as recorded a video:

5396,RedTrack: 2019 in Review,"Well, it seems that the time to sum up the year has come. Everyone relives all their victories, failures, pleasant moments, and instructive experiences. As to RedTrack team, we are infinitely grateful to 2019 for all the useful feedback, demanding users, friends, and partners that helped us to make the world of ad tracking and management a little bit better, easier, and tech-advanced. Throughout all these 12 months we did our best to make our users tracking activities the easiest and the most enjoyable part of their daily routine. 

So, we thought: why not to remember all those great moments we shared this year together? Don’t worry, in this blog post there will be no rants and long speeches. Just take your cup of coffee or tea and let’s go back to the past for 5 minutes.


&nbsp;
RedTrack victories

&nbsp;



First, we should admit to you we kept one secret from you. And it seems to us that New Year holidays are the most suitable time to make this kind of confession. 

We’re happy to say that RedTrack has become an official Google tech partner. We became one of the few who graduated from Google Tech Incubator and improved our product and strategy according to Google recommendations. We met a great number of new partners along the way there that help us to resolve any issues concerning this traffic source in the fastest way possible. More perks are coming ;)



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

But that's not all. This April our team has got the Best Support Award from Software Suggest team. Since the foundation, our customers’ well-being and happiness have always been our top priority. Today we take all the masks off. Meet our customer success and support managers. It was they who managed and helped you to set up your campaigns, edit scripts and answered all sophisticated questions all over the year.

&nbsp;





&nbsp;

This year we also launched regular Q&amp;A sessions and webinars where we revealed all ad tracking and management secrets and gave detailed answers to your most frequently asked questions.

If you still have not subscribed to our channel, now is the time to do this. Do not miss our exclusive educational videos next year. A little secret, we’ve already prepared a lot of interesting things:)


RedTrack features that changed it all
&nbsp;

In 2019, we took several big steps towards the realization of our main goal — to automate the processes of ad tracking, management &amp; optimization as much as possible. Based on your requests, we launched three big features, which unexpectedly for us already managed to make a noise in the industry:
1. Publisher Panel 
This feature was designed to help SMEs and media-agencies effectively manage publishers with less burden of routine and zero workarounds. The Panel has become a perfect solution for those who struggled with functions overloading and the high cost of available performance marketing platforms.

Learn more: RedTrack Publisher Panel: track and manage your affiliates with no workaround.

&nbsp;
2. Fraud Report
We can’t do anything with fraud traffic increasing volumes, but we can protect ourselves from its negative impact. Fraud Report was designed together with experts from Fraud Score and has become the solution that already helped RedTrack users to save thousands of $. It gives the full overview of the traffic your buy and inspects the quality of every ad click based on 13 metrics and provides the ratio of human clicks and fraud ones with the reason of fraud behavior. 

On top of that, it shows you the exact reason why your clicks were marked with fraud labels: cookie stuffing, proxy-connected user, hijacked device, and others.

Learn more: Fraud: to pay or not to pay? – Brand new feature by RedTrack

&nbsp;
3. A set of automation tools
This is probably our biggest 2019 pride. The release of the RedTrack auto-rules feature is a step towards our key mission – to automate as many tasks of the work of an affiliate marketer as possible. 

You start your campaign, set KPI and RedTrack algorithms start working. If the benchmark is not met they automatically stop or redistribute the traffic flow. One of the best things is that they notify you as soon as changes to your campaign were implemented. So, basically, all the rules can be divided into three categories:


 	Rules that pause campaign when metrics drop
 	Rules that redistribute traffic for stream/lander/offer based on performance.
 	Rules that stop your campaign when the amount of fraud traffic exceeded the allowable amount

RedTrack new integrations
&nbsp;

 	
The long-awaited Integration with Google Analytics




Now all Google Analytics users can easily track and report their conversions inside Google account without let or hindrance. 

Once conversion appears in RedTrack, it sends S2S postback to your Google Analytics account. The set-up is easy and fast. You can request a detailed guide at sales@redtrack.io.

 	
Integration with that very CJ Affiliate


Believe it or not, but CJ Affiliate doesn’t support S2S postback tracking, so to track their offers effectively you have to be integrated with it via API. RedTrack users became the first to implement this solution. 

With RedTrack S2S Postback Tracking feature, CJ Affiliate users can easily track ads across all browsers with no-cookies. The best part is that it can be easily done in 4 simple steps. The guide is here.
Seamless integrations through API with 64 Traffic Sources
Having your Traffic Source properly connected to RedTrack allows you to transfer any updated data between them in the easiest, fastest, and most reliable way. You can also be sure about data integrity across your stack without worrying about versioning issues.

More than 6o Traffic Sources are now integrated with RedTrack with the help of API.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
RedTrack global expansion 
In 2019 RedTrack has officially become a global international startup with servers located all around the globe. It allows us to serve the client’s needs from every part of the world without any delay. It concerns the speed of redirects, data loading, and Affiliate Networks and Traffic Sources data processing speed.

Happy Tracking!",12/27/2019,https://redtrack.io/blog/redtrack-2019-review/,Updates
5501,The definitive guide to Facebook Ads Tracking [2024 updated],"Facebook is considered to be the most popular social media platform today. Having 2.4 billion users from all over the world on board, it attracts thousands of marketers, media buyers, and affiliates. But does Facebook Ads really work? Especially after iOS 14 Privacy Update, there are a lot of questions about Facebook effectiveness.

Does anyone still pay attention to all these endless offers in their newsfeed? Well, considering Facebook's $1 billion in advertising revenue per quarter, it seems like it is worth your time. But then we see this:

- Facebook ad CTR has been consistently declining over the last year, from a median of 2.36% in Q1 2018 to a median of 1.33% in Q1 2019

- 62 Percent of Small Business Owners Say Facebook Ads Miss Their Targets

- Only 42% of marketers feel that their Facebook marketing is successful 

and this

- ""You have to be careful because your efforts might ultimately be wasted if you focus 100% of your time doing affiliate marketing on Facebook"" - Quora.

It's not surprising that after reading these headlines the confidence of those who only start their Facebook Ad is diminished. But we suggest not making hasty conclusions and sort things out thoroughly. Let's do it together in this guide.

&nbsp;
Is it a good idea to run Facebook ads in 2022?
Let's figure out first what the Facebook Ads ecosystem actually gives to media-buyers. It allows targeting specific audiences that are likely to be interested in specific products and services by leveraging the immense wealth of the data it possesses. 



&nbsp;
As to Facebook ad costs, the average CPC here is around $0.97 per click, while on Youtube this figure is about $3.21 and $5.26 on Linkedin. Not so bad, isn’t it? 
So, if you meet someone claiming that he can’t make money on Facebook and advise you to choose another Traffic Source, we recommend you not to rush. There’s a high probability that it’s not a Facebook fault. Most often it happens due to the advertiser’s lack of knowledge and incorrect settings. Furthermore, let's figure out which campaign can be considered successful and which not? The easiest and most objective way is to compare your metrics with average market performance.

An average CTR on Facebook Ads is between 2-5%, but the exact value is very dependent on the niche. Here are several of them:



Industry
Average CR
Average CPC


Apparel
$4.11%
$0.45


Auto
$5.11%
$2.24


B2B
$10.63%
$2.52


Beauty
$7.10%
$1.81


Consumer Services
$9.96%
$3.08


Education
$13.58%
$1.06


Employment &amp; Job Training
$11.73%
$2.72


Finance &amp; Insurance
$9.09%
$3.77


Fitness
$14.29%
$1.90


Home Improvement
$6.56%
$2.93


Healthcare
$11.00%
$1.32


Industrial Services
$0.71%
$2.14


Legal
$5.60%
$1.32


Real Estate
$10.68%
$1.81


Retail
$3.26%
$0.70


Technology
$2.31%
$1.27


Travel &amp; Hospitality
$2.82%
$0.63



&nbsp;

Looking at the table, some might conclude that Facebook is the perfect media platform for promoting fitness or education products and isn't very suitable for industrial services advertising. In fact, this is not entirely true. Whereas the target audience for industrial services is definitely much smaller than for fitness products, a single sale can bring you ten times more money than selling 100 bottles of premium bottled water for sports fans.


Also, keep in mind that neither CR nor CTR or engagement rate can't be applied for an objective assessment of the cost-effectiveness and its value for your business. If your ad campaign gets you a lot of Reach, Clicks, and Conversions, but you’re actually losing money per sale when you sum up all your expenses, then your strategy is no good. 

What about the recent changes in Facebook Ads after privacy Update by Apple was rolled out? We see problems around Facebook pixel, constant blocking of Business Manager, inability to verify domains to be able to run ads effectively. Well, we can agree — it's not pleasant. However, keep in mind that Facebook still remains the biggest social media in the world and catches the eyes of your potential clients. So we do have to find a way around it. If you want to learn more about the shift to Facebook Conversion API and how it changes advertising on Facebook — be sure to read this article ""How Facebook Conversion API is changing advertising?""

&nbsp;
How to make Facebook ads work for you
The whole process of promoting your offer on Facebook can be divided into 4 phases: preparation, running ads, tracking &amp; analytics, and optimization.

However illogical it may seem at first sight, you should start with an ad tracker set up. Otherwise, your guesswork may result in a huge wasted ad spend if you don't track all the outcomes. Facebook allows you to track your ads absolutely for free with a built-in Facebook Analytics tool. With it, you can track some basic metrics of your campaign performance. And though it is often ignored by experienced media-buyers, it can actually be a good starting point for those beginners who are making their first steps in the world of FB advertising and are eager to test their hypothesis at the lowest cost. In this case, you only need to create a Facebook Pixel and add it to the code of your thank-you-page. 



As we cheer for your success, we must warn that if you rely solely on Facebook Pixel, you are in big trouble. Ever since iOS 14 rolled out the Privacy Update, Facebook started a shift to Facebook Conversion API and pixel is not as trustworthy as it used to be. Other issues you usually face with FB Pixel:

 	Facebook statistics mismatch business statistics
 	Tracking Pixels often don’t fire or fire several times if you use omnichannel marketing strategy to the same conversion page
 	Pixels can be blocked by Safari, Mozilla, and other adblocking tools

Again, it can be a good tool for your first ad campaign, but if you have a complex sales funnel, work with several paid marketing channels or combine organic and paid traffic, analyzing your campaign without a reliable ad tracker can be a big strategic miscalculation. It's almost impossible to track the effectiveness of all your marketing channels correctly and get the whole picture of your user's actions and their characteristics. Therefore, we suggest not losing money and time and going to the tracker setup.

Another issue tracker can help you solve is the verification of third-party domains. At RedTrack.io  we found a way to help you verify domains with ease and keep running your ads. If you want to learn more about this topic, be sure to watch our latest stream on YouTube.



Preparation
Get reliable data from Facebook Ads &amp; Set up Facebook CAPI
With RedTrack you can easily set up Facebook Conversion API ad track your conversions from Facebook, being sure about the accuracy of the information that you get with the help of non-redirect tracking. Remember those redirect URLs are forbidden on Facebook. Once Facebook detects it, you’ll be banned.

The non-redirect set-up consists of 3 simple steps:


RedTrack setup:

 	Add Facebook as a Traffic Source. 
 	Create a Campaign with Facebook as a Traffic Source and Save &amp; Close the tab. Scroll down and you'll see that all the dynamic macros that would store additional information about your audience and traffic source parameters are already configured by default. 
 	Copy and put your automatically generated Direct Traffic Script to your landing page.


Facebook Ads setup: 

 	Create New Campaign or Use the existing Campaign inside the “Create Ad” section and set up campaign parameters.

 	Copy LP URL (the link without macros) to Destination/Website URL. 
 	Add macros to URL parameters with the help of the 'Add parameter' option. Make sure they match the ones you set up in RedTrack.



At this link, you can find the full setup guide. If anything, contact our support team at support@redtrack.io and we'll be happy to help you.

To run ads on Facebook you should have either a fan page or create a landing page. The need for a landing page fully depends on your product, its sales cycle length, goals, and the type of relationship you have with the audience. Don’t worry, we will analyze each of the cases in detail further in this guide.
Choose the right goal for your Facebook Ads campaign
On Facebook, you can choose one of the three goals groups: awareness, consideration, and conversion. Don’t diminish the importance of this step as your choice will not only influence Facebook algorithms behavior but also determine the metrics you must track:



&nbsp;
- Awareness:
Choose this goal if you want to generate interest in your product or service or build a community. In this case, you want to make sure the copies you submit complement all your other affiliate marketing efforts on Facebook as you don't want to deceive their expectations and disappoint with the irrelevant content. For this goal, it’s important to keep your business page up-to-date and constantly interact with your audience. So, before running a Facebook campaign, warm up your account and fill it with high-quality engaging content.

Key metrics to track: Reach, Frequency, Engagement Rate. 



&nbsp;
- Consideration:
Consideration goals are more suitable for those cases when you work with people who are in the middle of your sales funnel. These are the people who've already demonstrated their interest in your offer or similar products. And now you want to convince them to buy by providing valuable and highly informative content about your product. By choosing one of the consideration goals, you make it clear to Facebook algorithms that you want to find delivery opportunities that drive web traffic and engagement.


Key metrics to track: Conversion Rate, Engagement, Landing page performance, App installs.



&nbsp;
- Conversion:
This group of goals is best applied to the audience that already heard about you enough. Now you want to motivate them to buy or use a product or service. You may direct them to your Pre-landers to collect their email addresses. 

Key metrics to track: Conversions, Sales.

&nbsp;



&nbsp;

At this point, we are simply obligated to remind you of the rule of thumb: users rarely buy from the first impression. Affiliates that earn a fortune on Facebook create funnels with several steps and provide valuable content before asking to buy. While practicing, you’ll see that a high percentage of your landing page visitors weren't actually looking for your product or even have a slight understanding of having a particular that your product may solve.
Define your audience
After we've decided on our campaign goals, it’s time to answer the question of who are these people that may be interested in an offer. This is usually done by audience segmentation. What it means is that you should create the profile of the users with similar characteristics to whom Facebook will show your ads. Luckily, Facebook has thousands of custom audience options that allow you to create amazingly refined audience segments for your campaigns. It divides all the audiences into three main categories: Core, Custom, and Lookalike audiences.

&nbsp;



&nbsp;
Core Audience 
This option allows you to target users based on the following parameters:

 	Locations – from an entire continent down to a 1-mile radius.
 	Age.
 	Gender.
 	Language. 
 	Detailed Targeting.
 	Connections.
 	Life events and some profile status – e.g. people who are recently engaged or have children and others

Custom audience
 It defines those people who have already engaged with your offer/business or it can also be an email database of those people who can be potentially interested in your offer.



Look-alike audience 
It's automatically generated by Facebook on the basis of the database you provide. It can be a Custom Audience created with your pixel data, your mobile app data, or fans of your Business Page. This option is frequently used for warm and hot traffic.


Cold vs Warm vs Hot Traffic
The term cold traffic is often used to describe people who have total ignorance of the company/product or service you promote. That means they basically have no idea who you are and what you are doing. People categorized as warm traffic already have a basic level of knowledge about you. They may have visited your site before, read your content, signed up to your emails or have been following your Facebook page for some time. BUT what sets them apart from hot traffic is that they haven’t indicated any interest in buying from you so far. Hot traffic is described for those who recognize and understand the value of the product, purchased your product and probably shared it with others.
Choose your Bidding Strategy
As you know, Facebook distributes ads based on an auction format. It means that in order to get your ad shown you have to win at auction. A bid is a figure that represents how much you're ready to spend to achieve your target audience. By default, Facebook automates it for you, but you have a free option to change to better control your costs. Facebook recommends setting a daily budget that is at least five times higher than your bid cap as it needs at least 50 events/week to properly optimize your campaign.

Running Facebook Ads campaigns
Cold Traffic
So, you need to find your audience. Let's say right away that if you've never promoted your offer or similar products before, the image of the audience that you now have in your head is erroneous. But it's not a big deal. We all were there. The only method that will help you to find your audience is testing. So, let's take it to step by step:

1. Create several audiences and isolate each from each other into separate ad sets and use the same ads for each of those ad sets.

As an outcome, you'll see which audiences perform better for your offer and prioritize them. Once you know your best-performing audiences, you can test various types of ads or copy.

2. Test ad copy either in separate ad sets (similar to audience tests) or in separate campaigns. This helps you to see any possible correlation between the audiences and ad types.


How much should I spend? 
There is no specific figure, but usually, it should be 2-3 times the target cost per conversion, per ad set.

For example, if you are expecting a conversion cost of $5 per event, be ready to spend at least $10-15 per ad set before optimizing your campaign to make sure you gather enough performance data.

What content should you promote?

You may interest your cold audience with the following ad formats: 

 	Blog posts,
 	Power posts (also referred to as epic, data-driven content),
 	Videos,
 	Podcasts,
 	Research findings,
 	Lead magnet squeeze pages,
 	Surveys,
 	Guides.

Warm Traffic

This type of traffic can be divided into two categories: 

 	People who already know about you and your product but haven’t been targeted before.
 	Your retargeting audience – people who visited your website and/or came in contact with your brand. 

Audience #1: 
In order to convert your warm audience,  you need to drive it to pages or assets that deliver value but also remind them of their interest in your product or services. For these purposes, the following types of content will be ideal:

 	Lead magnets (e-books, white papers, etc.),
 	Product demos,
 	Webinars,
 	Free tools,
 	Trial signup pages (free),
 	Events,
 	Offers.

Audience # 2: retargeting campaign:
Your remarketing group may include your website visitors, your Facebook page fans, people who engaged with any of your organic posts or ads, your video viewers or your custom list which interacted with your product outside of the Facebook environment.



But be careful with creating a too broad retargeting audience. Retargeting every website visitor means you run the risk of diluting your marketing message.

Let’s say you have two different users who visited your website. One has spent 40 seconds scrolling the main page from top to bottom while another has carefully read all the information about your product and signed up for lead-magnet. In the first case, it may be worth promoting your lead-magnet offer while in the second it won't make any sense. You risk sending the wrong offer to the wrong person at the wrong stage of their buyer’s journey.

Prevent your retargeting campaign from burning out by changing and updating ads, and using burn pixels remarketing cookies. Quite often, the new retargeting campaign performs amazingly well after launch, but it slowly dies down with time.

Here it is. 

Now what you need is to set a budget and time to run your campaign and the most complicated thing... wait.

&nbsp;
Measuring &amp; Optimizing your Facebook Ads  campaigns
Once you start running your ads on Facebook, you can watch everything happening with it in real-time with the help of extended Campaign reports available in your RedTrack interface.

The data is passed quickly and with no delays. To get them just go to your Campaign tab, select your desired Campaign and click the Report button. You'll have all the data about your campaign and can easily group it by the parameters, including offer, landing, date, Date parting, Connection, IP, Device, OS, and others. After getting enough data, you can analyze and optimize your campaigns to reach higher results. 



&nbsp;
Use FTO (fast take off) method
 It helps you need to get the results faster as the smaller the starting budget, the more it takes to your campaign to take off. The essence of the method is as follows:


 	set daily and lifetime budgets exceed your planned minimum budget
 	wait until you ads get 10,000+ impressions, 
 	analyze what’s working and prioritize your ad sets
 	lower your budget back to initially planned one

Keep in mind that Facebook needs at least 24 hours to adjust the performance of your ads after every edit.
Experiment with the schedule
While analyzing, you'll notice that there are always some days and hours that outperform the rest. Find the best time for advertising and keep all your campaigns.on a custom schedule. On the one hand, it will allow you to improve your performance indicators and earn more, on the other - your users won’t get bored with them as quickly.


Rotate Ads regularly
If you don't change your creatives, you should be ready that people will get bored soon. experiments show that showing the same creative to the same audience more than four times leads to a significant click-through rate increase. To avoid it, simply create several creative with different designs or set up an ad campaign with multiple ad sets with different ads and schedule each one of them on different days.


Always limit your A/B test to only one element
Some advertisers can make hasty conclusions. To get relevant data for analyzes, wait until you get at least 300 clicks/conversions/ leads. Even better if you can wait until you have 300 or 500 conversions per variation. 
Set up auto-optimization rules
There's a free and easy way not to spend hours in front of the monitor and track the effectiveness of your campaigns. Just use RedTrack automation set of features that will automatically optimize your campaigns and traffic if it doesn't meet expected KPIs. 



Automation rules allow you to:

1) Automatically pause or stop weak campaigns
Set KPIs for your campaigns, like desired EPC, CR, or ROI and we would automatically pause sending traffic to this campaign if set metrics are not met.

2) Redistribute traffic inside a campaign among its various elements

Simply create a rule for several offers/landers/streams inside one campaign, and RedTrack would automatically distribute traffic between them once the performance of one increases or decreases. The special algorithms will optimize your ad/creatives/landing pages' performaтce and offer weight.

3) Get rid of fraud traffic and help focus on trusted and efficient one

Use the rules &amp; alerts feature together with our Fraud Report, and RedTrack will automatically pause traffic in your traffic source if the quality of clicks is suspicious.

&nbsp;
What you can't promote on Facebook
Facebook has strict advertising policies. It will take some time to review your ads and decide whether to approve it or not and even check the page that your ad will be driving traffic to. So, be ready to have your ad disapproved if your page doesn't match up with what your ad is promoting. 



On top of that, there's a list of products that you simply can't promote on Facebook Ads. Here are 10 of them:

 	Unregulated Supplements
 	Adult Products
 	Third-Party Infringements
 	Surveillance Equipment
 	Counterfeit Products
 	Health Products: Before and After
 	Controversial Products
 	Weapons
 	Tobacco Products
 	Drugs and Drug-Related Products

Conclusion
As you see, Facebook Ads is a powerful and workable tool for affiliates and media-buyers in various niches. RedTrack, in its turn, helps them to get the most out of it by providing quality tracking and optimization tools. With it, you won't have to worry about your pixels events firing, the accuracy of data, and the need for a dozen of sub-pages. If you have any questions please refer them to support@redtrack.io.

With regard to the latter, 90% of US  consumers use coupons in some way, including paper ones. As to special national preferences, there are also some interesting facts that are worth our attention.

What does it mean?  Everyone loves Deals. All we need is to understand how to use them in the most efficient way with no loss for the margins. That's what this article is all about. 
Affiliate Coupons FAQ
- What is an Affiliate Coupon?
A coupon/discount code is a deal or a promo code consisting of a series of symbols (digits or letters) that various businesses create to encourage consumers to buy a particular product or service from them. Typically, these codes are parts of their business's advertising and product marketing strategies and are used for a higher volume of sales.

Coupons are as popular in a digital space within affiliate marketers.
Affiliate coupons — these are the same coupons we are used to in advertising &amp; marketing that are used by affiliate marketers to bring attention to the product, recruit new customers, re-activate former ones and sell more.


&nbsp;
- What types of coupons exist?

 	Quantity Discounts. Here you can come up with different variations like order 2 or more of a certain product and get 20% off your next purchase or get it entirely for free.

 	The amount discounted from the offer's total cost. Most often this example implies certain restrictions. For example, you get 20% off your purchase if you spend 1000$ or more.
 	Free shipping coupons. It seems like it's clear as day, isn't it?
 	Special events discounts. These coupons are dedicated to holidays or special events ( Black Friday, Christmas, Happy New Year, etc).

 	A free product offer. It can be used as bait or as an element of the freemium business model.

&nbsp;



 
- Do they actually work in 2021?
Absolutely! The Experian’s Email Benchmark report that shows that emails with coupons have:

 	14% higher open rate;
 	34% more unique clicks;
 	27% higher transaction Rate ;
 	48% boost in revenue per email.

According to the Data Analytics Department of CouponUpto, more than 50% of consumers think that when they are considering different goods, online coupons like promo codes will say the final decision. People believe that coupons are smart spending solutions, that are followed by the emergence of a series of online coupon vendors.

- Where should I post my Coupons to earn money? 
According to Inmar Shopper Behavior Study, buyers use 5.8 methods to discover or acquire coupons, combining both traditional and digital methods. The most popular methods include coupon websites (96%), brand websites (92%), retailer websites (91%), search engines ( 85%), social media ( 68%).

The popularity of affiliate coupon websites is rising every year. It is not surprising that there is a serious struggle for showing up on the 1st or 2nd Google page and increasing organic traffic. Almost  30% of buyers search for a discount code almost every time they make an online purchase. And what's more, these numbers apply not only to the older generation, as many of you might have thought. .      
How to work with Affiliate Coupon Websites?
Coupon websites make money by working with advertisers and brands and driving traffic to their products. Both small and big businesses all over the world are interested in posting special offers on them. The reason is simple. It's an effective promotion channel with almost zero up-front costs and decreased risk. Top coupon websites have not only a good SEO presence but large user bases that they target with personalized newsletters and ads. One of their main features is that they typically work with CPA (cost per action) monetization model, so you pay only for sales and conversions generated by publishers, not for clicks or impressions. Isn't it great?




To partner with such websites, most often you'd have to go through Affiliate Networks - intermediaries between you and the coupon website. The most popular Affiliate Networks include CJ Affiliate, Rakuten LinkShare, and Shareasale, and others. Many of them have smooth integrations with RedTrack.io, so ad tracking and management processes become easy parts of the job. The pros of working with affiliate coupon websites include:

 	saving your time and productivity costs of managing individual affiliate relationships,
 	expanding your brand’s reach to the huge amount of online shoppers ( especially if these sites have good SEO ranking),
 	introduce your brand to online shoppers who haven’t heard of you yet. 

Types of Coupon Affiliate Websites
So, suppose you decided to test how coupons work for your products. You've made a list of the most interesting online platforms and ready to send your first requests. Wait for a second. It will be more reasonable to check their reliability first. There's no secret that the affiliate marketing industry attracts many scammers who use a variety of grey and black tactics to reach their financial goals. It can be anything from black-hat SEO to bidding on your brand name and stealing traffic for branded coupon-related keywords. So, let's divide all affiliate coupon websites into two big groups: good ones and bad ones.

Good examples of coupon Affiliate sites:
In general, all good coupon websites can be categorized as follows:

 	
Curated coupon sites
A traditional coupon website simply displays all the coupons they have as they are. Curated coupon sites often have some editorial people who make the coupons look more attractive to the audience, categorize them, place in special lists and highlight the most promising ones.



 	
Loyalty coupon sites


Loyalty coupon websites are those that offer cash-back rebates to their customers. What they do is sharing their affiliate commission with those who made a purchase. Because of the cash-back system, these sites typically have extremely loyal user bases that start their shopping with these kinds of websites. However, we advise you to check if there are any of the competitors' deals on the wanted site. Sometimes the owners may willing to leave your brand for a competitor if the site posts a better deal.



&nbsp;

 	
Coupon blogs


There are thousands of bloggers who are promoting brand coupons in different ways and for different prices. Your offer may be included in curated blog lists, such as “Best Ways to Lose your Weight Fast,” as well as dedicated blog reviews of your product or simply a banner. Bloggers often focus on a specific industry or niches and care about the reputation of their own brand reputation. That's why they often refuse to place coupons on their websites. You should be ready that It does not always happen due to objective factors. Nonetheless, it's worth a try. Our advice - do not try to contact top bloggers at the very beginning. Start with micro-ones. If they have good Engagement Rates, the outcome might be the same.



 	
Coupon forums


Like all the other forums, coupon ones are user-driven. Their members regularly update the threads with new offers, tips&amp;tricks, comments, questions, and answers. Brands often enter into partnership agreements with them by paying a fee or supporting their activities. They can also develop individual affiliate relationships with some of the most active and prominent members. If you choose the second strategy, make sure it's allowed by a forum's owners. If you see that such a workload is overwhelming, you can always try RedTrack Partnership Portal that will help you track and manage your affiliates with no workaround.

&nbsp;



Coupon websites to avoid
There's a variety of ways how dishonest website owners can catch you. They may use bots to game the system or cancel the orders after purchase, list fake or expired deals and many others. Good news  - you can easily check the website for its reliability. How? Easy!

1)  evaluate the traffic stats on SimilarWeb and pay special attention to the two parameters:

- whether the traffic numbers the website claims match what Similar Web says,
- how much organic traffic does they have ( try to avoid the one organic traffic percentages above 90%).

&nbsp;



&nbsp;

2) test out some of the website's deals.  

3) check the frequency of updates and the number of expired coupons.

4) make sure there's a clear definition of commissions.

5) evaluate its online presence. Good presence - the 1st or the 2nd page of Google.

6) search for reviews. At least they should be.
How to Add Coupon Affiliate Sites to your Affiliate Marketing Mix
Every product is different. And for some of them, coupons might not be the best solution. Ideally, coupons should drive lifetime value without eating into your margins too much. If you enter a highly competitive mass market, coupons may help you to stand out among competitors due to price leadership and attract the attention of price-sensitive customers. But if you're working with a product or a service with high value-added and unique features that strongly distinguish it from the rest, coupons may simply devalue them in the eyes of your target audience and scare it away. It certainly does not apply to such special cases as Black Friday, Christmas and other special holidays when everyone expects discounts. If you decided that coupons fit your product, then we advise you to
1. Concentrate on several websites
There's a huge number of websites that will offer you a placement. And there're hundreds of hungry affiliates who would like to promote it. Instead of trying all possible options, build and optimize your relationship with a few select coupon sites and learn it all about coupons world. Far not everything will turn out right the first time, but this is a chance not to make a lot of mistakes at the very beginning. Make a list of high-quality sites and develop relationships with their affiliate representatives. The better your relationship, the more chances you'll be placed and promoted thoroughly. There are almost always hidden extra benefits.
2. Provide guidelines
Keep in mind that affiliates are free-minded people and they want to get conversions/sales at any rate. If you're planning to play along, it’s in your interest to let marketers understand what is possible and what is not. You may create some guidelines on how they should feature you, what kind of language to use and what GEOs to target. If you care about the product reputation there are probably some industries that you don't want it to be associated with. 
3. Optimize your own website/landing page for coupons

Make sure you mentioned the deal on your website. Otherwise, if a user who came from the affiliate coupon website does not see discount confirmation, he may think that it was just a scam and leave. Ideally, the coupon should be automatically applied to the checkout page through the affiliate link and leave a user the opportunity to enter. his promo code manually. Just in case the first option won't work.  

&nbsp;

4. Expand your reach with influencers
Similar to coupon blogs, influencers can give you much more than coupon websites as they usually offer several promotion formats like promo code + in-depth review, informative video or creative product placement in one of their own products. Make sure they know how they can benefit from working with you. You can offer them a free trial ( if you're an advertiser) or participation in the referral program with clear advantages. 

But again, before partnering with anyone, check their credibility and statistics as you did with a coupon site. A good influencer will show you examples of the successful campaigns he made for similar products and share all the necessary numbers. And always keep your finger on the pulse and keep in touch with them. The more influencer knows about your products, the better the campaign will be. 
5. Track performance with conversion tracking solution
Ad tracking tool is one of the first things you have to take care of as an affiliate. It is vital for you to be able to define the most converting offers and optimize for higher payouts. At RedTrack, we are focused on delivering the best from ad tracking &amp; conversion attribution so you can automate, optimize and boost your performance.

Challenge
Today, more and more advertisers are turning to performance marketing. This, in turn, imposes a great responsibility on ad agencies that are fully responsible for their clients’ performance.

In their day-to-day activities, Mobfolio faces the routine of tracking, monitoring, and optimization of a big amount of ad campaigns. It required them a lot of time, as every time before making optimization decisions, you need to get enough data first.   
“In today’s world, it’s pretty clear that to achieve high results you definitely need stable, reliable and up-to-date tracking and optimization solutions. Moreover, they have to be done with a deep understanding of the market and the client's needs and keep abreast of even minor industry twists and turns.”
- Mark, Mobfolio agency 

Some agencies used to hire their own developers and in-house ad-tech experts to develop their own tracking solution. RedTrack users’ survey showed that there are several reasons why they chose not to do it now. Among the most popular reasons are:

•  lack of resources and high side-spends. 

•  the necessity to update tech stack according to industry changes. The affiliate marketing industry is very dynamic. Fraud tactics are becoming more sophisticated, 3rd-party cookies are dying, advertisers require more in-depth reporting from publishers. You need to make sure you keep updating your expertise and stack with these changes, otherwise, it can result in money loss.

&nbsp;
Solution
The Mobfolio team moved their advertising tracking and analytics to RedTrack. Using RedTrack's sophisticated tracking and reporting opportunities, Mobfolio was able to launch promo campaigns in bulk measuring and optimizing their performance in real-time. 


“I’ve been in performance marketing for over 10 years. During this time I've tried a huge amount of tracking solutions, ad servers &amp; optimizations systems. The problem is that you need a solution that, on the one hand, has a variety of advanced features able to help you with ad management &amp; optimization routine, and, on the other, is cost-effective. Basically, that's why we chose RedTrack. They help us focus on what we know best and get better results with our customers at an affordable price”.
- Mark, Mobfolio agency 

Among the RedTrack features that perfectly address Mobfolio’s needs are:

1. Event tracking. If you work in e-commerce or mobile advertising, you know how this is important to understand each and every step of the funnel: from the first touchpoint to the 'Add to cart' action. ""In RedTrack, each event can be separated and reported to the corresponding traffic source. For example, we can see that we have one more 'add to cart' from Facebook and another 'Sale' from an Email follow-up. This helps us to understand potential buyers and improve drastically our metrics, like CR and ROI”.

2. LP management features. ""RedTrack allows us to manage a campaign using one or many landers and connect different offers to the same lander. In simple words, we can create a lander and do an A/B test that will show us the difference between how the two versions of the page performed and combine both of them with one or many offers"".

3. Automation features set. It helps spend money more efficiently and optimize media buying while not focusing on repetitive tasks. ""The most obvious benefit we see is that we can now automatically a/b test different landers and offers, and distribute traffic between them to get higher profit."" This feature-set includes an automatic pause of campaigns/creatives, an auto-blacklist of placements, and an auto-update cost. Currently, 20 Traffic Sources are API integrated and synched with RedTrack. 

Among other features, agencies value in RedTrack are:

 	Multi-access, that gives the access rights of different levels to your team members;
 	Cookieless tracking, a must-have feature for everyone who works with Google or Facebook;
 	Consolidated reports with 30+ data points for traffic monitoring and analysis;
 	Fraud detection;
 	Impression tracking and impression forwarding;
 	Multi-step funnel tracking, used to set pre-landers, landers, offers and mix and match and set weight;
 	Publisher and Advertiser Panels to effectively manage all your publishers, etc.

Case study by Mobfolio: ""A/B testing with RedTrack""
In Mobifolio we usually start our promo campaigns with two versions of the same page. So, the traffic weight percentage is usually 50:50. Once we have enough data, we make the page with better performance than the leading one and leave the rest in rotation, giving them about 10% - 20% of the traffic. 

During a campaign for one of our clients — the mobile e-commerce publisher, we noticed that the number of ""Add to Cart '' events on mobile was much lower than on desktop. Our main hypothesis was that the information was poorly presented and simply disturbed the user. After testing a few LP versions, we were able to find a perfect decision by adding a floating footer with a ""Buy"" button to one of the pages. It allowed users to make a purchase easier (it's a hot place for promotion as well).



With the help of A/B tests with RedTrack, the Mobfolio ad agency was able to find the best landing page structure that helped users to come to a decision faster and make purchases easier. The users were able to make purchases easier. This small change increased the performance of the page by 18% and the significant part was that we could test it with a simple function in the system.
“In our practice, we could have a great number of ’Add to cart’ events with a much lower amount of 'Sales' ones. Users obviously liked the product but something made them quit it before the end of the sale. In the end, We just changed the checkout on an A/B test flow to compare it to the old page and the results improved in a matter of hours!”

5968,How to Skyrocket your business with RedTrack Data Reports,"



""I was just scrolling my Facebook feed and I saw **' s post. His story had a strong impact on me and I decided to go into the media-buying industry.""




“I saw this trick in one of ** 's blog posts and decided to try it”.
&nbsp;

These are the typical answers you'll get when asking media-buyers about their becoming. And It’s not a big surprise really. Everyone loves case studies and success stories. Well-written ones can fill you with hope, give you valuable tips and help to look at an unsolvable task from a different angle. To be honest, you can often find the RedTrack team reading innovative companies' stories during the break. BUT. There’s a thing with them. Pretty much often people take other's stories as ready-made guides to action and copy their tactics, expecting to achieve the same results.

Unfortunately, this is not how things work here. We can choose the advised strategies, audiences, angles, tools, but media-buying has no proven success methodologies. There are just too many factors that live their own lives. Media-buying has become a data-driven art where success is mostly determined by a media buyer's analytical skills, creativity and the quality of data. You may have unconventional strategies and ambitions, but how can you be sure they really work and where is the right moment to pivot?
Only a quality ad reporting platform may answer these questions.
&nbsp;
The Good, the Bad and the Ugly Reporting
As you've noticed, we love conducting customer surveys to learn more about their needs and desires. ( By the way, you may still take part in one of them. Maybe you have special features requests or valuable feedback that can help improve the product? Tell us about it!)

Having analyzed the results, we were pleasantly surprised that RedTrack reports are one of our customers' favorite features. Why you'd ask?

Here's what we found out:
6 features media-buyers value in ad reporting platforms include the opportunity to
&nbsp;



If you go into Campaigns - &gt; Report into your RedTrack account you'll see a pretty and friendly dashboard that can become your loyal and indispensable assistant in making money. But first, 

Why do media-buyers choose RedTrack Reports over others?
&nbsp;
It’s a good question, actually. Today ad reporting platforms descriptions may look the same to users. Every business understands that media-buyers need reliable and accurate data and sometimes may hide their pitfalls under vague terms. What about RedTrack?

1. Reliable no-sampling data
While many industry newcomers may not take the data collection methodology seriously, it's an important point that determines the accuracy of the data you get and the quality of decisions you make. When sampling, the platform analyzes a specific subset of data and makes the assumptions about the entire set on the basis of this part, instead of analyzing the whole data set. Yes, this method is much quicker than a non-sampling one. That's why a lot for big advertising platforms like Google use it. But sometimes you'll pay too much for this speed. 

&nbsp;



&nbsp;
2. 30+ metrics for analysis
Everything you need to see the detailed picture of ad campaigns: Offer, Landing, Date, Date parting, Connection, IP, Device, OS, Browser, GEO, Language, Referrer, Stream, SubID and others:

&nbsp;




3. Customization
There are several ways you can customize your dashboard and reports and make them look the way you or your client want. Here are they:

 	

 	Clicking on the hamburger-menu button at the right corner of your dashboard, you can customize your entire dashboard, adding, hiding and re-ordering all the available columns and metrics






 	

 	Filtering your subIDs, you can create custom reports based on one or several subIDs. It allows you to limit the data to one country, audience characteristics, device type, and others.
 	Choosing the metrics to be grouped, you can order your Campaign data by the needed parameters.



By the way, there's no need to always take your laptop with you to stay up-to-date with the performance of your campaigns. RedTrack Reporting Dashboard not only from the web-application. There're free mobile apps for Android and iOS users where you can track your ad campaign anywhere and anytime. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
Okay, we have quality data. How to make it work for the good of your business? Analyze!


Analyze your data in a smart way
It may sound pretty obvious, but to make a good analysis, you need a plan. Remaining purpose-driven will focus your work, save you time in the long run and improve your business reporting outcomes.

Before digging into numbers, you need to determine:


There are various KPIs that you may follow with the help of RedTrack. But you don't have to focus on all of them. How to choose the right ones? Let's see
&nbsp;
6 KPIs to track into Reports

 	
Clicks


The Role:  determine the volume of traffic your ads and links bring to the website.

The importance:

Some mature experts are pretty skeptical about high clicks metric unless they drive conversions. However, if you're at the bottom of your sales funnel and want to build awareness, click and impressions are basically the main metrics you want to track. It reflects the audience's interest and with the help of A/B testing, you can establish a connection with your target audience. Try different text, pictures, angels and move on through the sales funnel.

The formula: clicks are just clicks:).

&nbsp;

 	CR (Conversion Rate)

The Role: shows the % visitors converted after interaction with your ads and links
 
The importance: CR helps you to see how effectively your landing page/banner (if direct-linking) delivers the promise you've made and how well it justifies the users' expectations. If you have a 10% CR, it means that 10 users out of 100 who visited your website, took the specific actions (purchased a product/sign up/ download/leaving contact details).


The formula: CR = (Number of Conversions / Number of Clicks) x 100



 	
CTR (Click-through rate)


The Role: helps you understand which types of your ads and links get the most interest.

The importance: As a Clicks metric, CTR doesn’t really relate to the economics of your ad campaign, as it doesn’t reflect any action you'd like your prospective customers to take after visiting your LP. But it can clearly demonstrate how your messages and ads are relevant to your target audience. 

So, if your main goal is to sell, it can be far more effective to focus on tracking KPIs that reflect actual value to your business, such as ROI, revenue, or CPA.

The formula: Click/ Impressions

 	
ROI (Return on Investment)


The Role: clearly shows how much revenue you make for each $ spent on the ad campaign.

The importance: When calculating your ad campaign ROI, RedTrack doesn't take into account all your operating expenses (subscription fees, publishers payments, etc). But while it doesn't reflect your overall business performance, it demonstrates the investment efficiency you’ve made in your affiliate program and their success compared to similar programs.

Campaign ROI formula: (Campaign Revenue - Campaign Costs) / Campaign Costs

&nbsp;



 	
CPA ( Cost Per Acquisition)


The Role: shows how much it takes you to acquire a new customer/lead.

The importance: there are no pitfalls and hidden meanings here. If you see that your CPA is high, that means that your campaign is not so effective, and you have either to make adjustments to lower the campaign costs or increase the number of customers gained.

The thing about CPA is that it won't provide you with meaningful insights apart from other metrics. To determine whether you have a good CPA, you compare it with the average revenue per customer. It's easy. Just divide your Revenue by the number of customers you've got. With it, you'll be able to see whether your investments into the acquisition are paying off. For example, if you're spending 20$ per customer acquisition but only get 10$ from it, then it's a sign for you to change something into your strategy.

The formula: Total Campaign Cost / Total Number of Customers Acquired Through the Campaign

 	
EPC ( Earnings per Click)


The Role: shows how much money you make per person who clicks on your ad

The importance: it varies. On the one hand, If your EPC&gt; CPA, it may be a sign to start scaling and spend more on users' acquisition. But it’s not a rule of thumb, especially if you work with affiliates. Here's why: it's likely that the affiliates will use different promotion strategies and tactics. Let's take content and coupons, for example. These methods have different natures and usually bring different clients, so it's not quite right to put together the EPCs they generate. 

The formula: Revenue /the number of clicks generated


Can you show me how should I track my data?

6155,New Affiliate Marketing Trends To Check Out in 2020,"Big thanks to Jitendra Vaswani who helped us prepare this publication. 
&nbsp;

Jitendra Vaswani is a Digital Marketing Practitioner &amp; international keynote
with 6+yrs of experience
and is always up to date with the latest affiliate marketing trends.

Main individual projects:

- the founder of  www.bloggersIdeas.com
- the author of “Inside A Hustler’s Brain: In Pursuit of Financial Freedom”

Will there be any significant changes in 2020?
2020 came just recently but has already brought us many surprises. So far, largely shocking ones. And yes, you guessed it right, we mean COVID-19. Whether we want it or not, it has had a significant impact not only on people’s lives but on brands’ cost structure and ad spendings. In China, for example,  47% of businesses reported that their sales had been significantly or severely impacted by the outbreak of the pandemic, and 7% of them had stopped their advertising activities completely. 

While the whole world is living in uncertainty, the challenges are emerging: supply chain issues, cash gaps, changeable consumer confidence, drop in demand, purchasing power loss and so on and so forth. We are not going to turn this post into a list of advice on what vertical you should choose. Just make sure you don’t put all the eggs in travel, luxury, real estate niches. If you're a beginner, try necessity good first. At least in the near future.



Big brands, in their turn, reduced their marketing spend by at least 30% (80% for some subsidiaries), shifting Q1 budgets to Q2 and consider to increase marketing contents associated with positive energy and mainstream tonality. The good news is that there are quite a lot of chances everything will be more or less stabilized by the 2nd half of the year. At least, that's what optimistic analysts say. Anyway, affiliate marketers should find ways to improve their efficiency. Let's see what are the affiliate marketing trends that will help us overcome all the difficulties of 2020.

Influencer Marketing
Influencer marketing is getting widely used in eCommerce, and the same is going to happen in affiliate marketing. The thing is that in 2020 celebrities, or so-called macro-influencers (500K – 1M followers), will start losing their popularity and become less relevant due to rising costs and declining engagement rates. Yes, they have millions of followers, but it has nothing with their ability to influence. The audience's relevance and the engagement rate are the first things you should think about as a marketer.

Micro-influencers’ (10K-50K) typical followers base size may not seem huge, but they are usually more affordable, on the other hand. Micro-influencers have a super-power to tap into defined micro-communities and establish meaningful and productive relationships with their members.

Nano-influencers usually have less than 10K followers. But it's not the case. On top of their relatively low pricing rates and high EG, an ideal nano-influencer has a very specialized fan base that can spread the word around your offer with no additional investments.

&nbsp;



&nbsp;

Just a quick stats from Rakuten’s 2019 Influencer Marketing Global Survey, if you’re still in doubts on whether to try this affiliate marketing trend or not:


 	65% of consumers discover a new brand or product through an influencer at least once a week,
 	87% were inspired by an influencer to make a purchase,
 	56% of women who follow influencers follow beauty, fashion and entertainment influencers,
 	54% of men who follow influencers follow gaming, tech and celebrity influencers,
 	70% of women prefer Instagram influencers,
 	53% of people find new influencers through social media recommendations,
 	31% of consumers recommend an influencer to friends and family at least once a week.


Voice Search Optimization
&nbsp;

Analysts say that voice search is going to take 50% of the total search volume in 2020, while 30% of all the searches will be done on the devices without a screen. If voice search isn’t a part of your strategy today – then make sure you know how to implement this affiliate marketing trend when the time comes.

The rise of voice search popularity has been caused by the increasing number of people, installing smart speakers to their phones, homes, and workplaces. If the forecasts come true, the rise of this affiliate marketing trend popularity will have a strong impact on the brand's content strategy playbooks, which will have to be optimized for audio queries. By the way, this also applies to you.

&nbsp;



&nbsp;

Today, most of the speakers are made by Google Home, Amazon Echo, Siri or Alexa. And it seems like there are just a few chances this market structure will change. It is interesting that users of 65+ years old use these devices more than others:

 	50% of them use them 1-3 times/day,
 	45% find them reliable and are able to answer their voice queries in 2 to 3 tries. 

What are the best ways to get voice search traffic? The best ways are typically considered to be guides, FAQ and blog section. Work on the content that keeps the conversation going rather than puts a stop to it. Use long-tail keywords and make sure it answers a query or a question.

&nbsp;
Data-Driven Marketing
&nbsp;

Data-driven marketing is going to play a key role in 2020 affiliate marketing. Data has become one of the most important factors when it comes to improving your marketing and ad efficiency with little effort on your part.

1. Use quality reports and analytics to make the right decisions

Only a quality non-sampling data can tell you exactly what's works and what's not. Good news, RedTrack gives has all the tools you can use to get the latest data about your campaigns in a customized way. You can easily check it into your RedTrack Reports dashboard that provides you with all the detailed information for effective in-depth tracking across 30+ metrics. Read more RedTrack Reports here.

&nbsp;





2. Use automation to save time and increase ROI

According to VentureBeat, companies that use marketing automation tools reported an 80% increase in leads and a 77 % increase in conversions. RedTrack with its automation features ( Auto-Rules) gives you a unique opportunity to set rules for your traffic at campaigns and creatives level and get alerts if KPIs are not met. The advantages are clear: you save your time, money and mental energy.


 	 Personalized marketing

The 2020 personalization isn’t about inserting customers’ names into emails. It’s about delivering them the right message at the right time. 91% of consumers are more likely to purchase from brands that deliver relevant personalized offers and recommendations. The only thing to know what’s relevant to them and what’s not is to use a quality ad tracker to gather important information about them.
Audio and Video Content
&nbsp;

In 2020, video has become one of the top high-performing types of content marketing. It has achieved 135% more organic reach than images, status, and link posts. As to consumers, they spend 3x more time on watching live videos than other forms of content. Facebook executives themselves predict that the platform will be all video by 2021.

&nbsp;



&nbsp;

Along with smart speakers, Streaming audio (AM/FM radio) and pure-play music services are the biggest outlets for brand advertisers today. Podcasts have become one of the key channels for many direct-to-consumer brands. They are not only useful in advertising for products and services but are also a great addition to a classic content marketing mix. Like videos, audio content also performs better than text posts. So, why not follow this affiliate marketing trend? Even though podcasts culture is now only under development stage, now over 51% of the population say they have listened to one of the 700,000 active podcasts in the United States.

&nbsp;
Native Advertising
&nbsp;

What should you know about Native advertising:

 	It's the number one digital advertising format of the 2020s and be worth $400bn by 2025 (eMarketer)
 	Native ads receive 53 % more views than traditional display ads. (Sharethrough)
 	This ad format increases purchase intent by 18 %. (Forbes)

But wait for a second. Some of you may have a question on what does a native advertisement actually means? The idea behind this ad format is to match an ad with the surrounding context. It integrates into the environment and typically looks like a regular social media post or Google search result. Why is it so effective? Due to its seamless integration with the surroundings, it shows better engagement and interacts with users on a deeper level. Read more about this affiliate marketing trend and its main features in our blog post - What are the best ad formats in affiliate marketing?
Mobile Phone Marketing
&nbsp;

The global mobile marketing market is expected to grow at a CAGR of over 25% in the 2018 - 2023 period. With it, some optimistic experts believe that mobile is going to take up 80% of all the online traffic in the upcoming few years. 

How to achieve better performance? 

There is no single miraculous recipe but there are some basic recommendations that will help you become better in mobile affiliate marketing:

- make sure your landing pages are mobile-friendly to avoid click loss. If possible, check how it works on different devices - Android, iOS and on different OS versions,
- choose the offers that have carrier billing to make it easy to convert,
- segment your customer base properly to identify customer needs better and provide personalized offers,
- use analytics and attribution,
- know when it’s the best time to reach out to your audience.

Mobile media use varies throughout the day. While desktop is more commonly used during the day, the  content consumption from Tablet and Smartphone dominates in the evening:

&nbsp;



&nbsp;



&nbsp;
Conclusion:

Using the abovementioned affiliate marketing trends, don’t be afraid of experimenting. Experiment with your target audiences, niches of content creators, commission rate, creatives, tone of voice and strategies.

Also, don’t forget to look at your competitors and check how they are promoting their products with the help of spy tools. Though we won’t advise you to copy their strategies,  you can always look up to them for inspiration and come up with your own techniques.

So, those were some of the new affiliate marketing trends in 2020 to check out. If you'd like to try something new, just look around and see what kind of technologies are being used and then try to come up with your own strategies to target your audience, and you will be good to go.

6233,Advanced Hacks to Improve Your Push ADS ROI [+video],"The average US smartphone user gets 46 push notifications/day. How could someone 
not get annoyed with such a high load of intrusive information?
The truth is, most of the time he couldn't. Push ads are real weapons that may madden users and destroy their confidence in notifications. Or, if carried out with precision, make them happy members of your converted leads the list with just one shot.


WHAT'S NOW?
Due to coronavirus, mobile app usage has grown significantly, so push traffic has spiked along with this. In addition to it, Apple has finally allowed using push notifications for advertising and marketing purposes, so long as users agree to receive the ads first. Today people are immersed in the news, endless movies, and video games. Most of them are either distracted, or bored, or in panic. It's time to make them happy with the offer they wanted to take. How?

We asked two Push Traffic experts to answer your most commonly asked questions and shared some tips about boosting your push campaign effectiveness. Here we published some of their answers. No registration and fees are required. Please, welcome 
 Eugene Kuznetzov,                                                                                                           Pavlo Bunakalia, 
Product Manager at RichPush &amp; RichPops                                           RedTrack.io Product Specialist

STARTING A SUCCESSFUL PUSH ADS:

4 things you should take care of :

1) choose the reliable Affiliate Network and become friends with your Manager
2) find and test a good offer
3) set up your tracker
4) choose and set up your Ad Network

Let's start from the very beginning:

Where can I find a good offer?

- There are two options here. You either try to find the offer by yourself or seek help from your Affiliate Network. The 1st option implies you having direct contact with an advertiser. Pick up a reliable spy tool to learn what is trending and what gets more conversions. The second option may take more time as good offers usually go to those people who have good relationships with Affiliate Networks Managers. No big science here. Just show your sheer interest, be nice and don't be afraid to ask questions. Their job is to help you and make you happy. 

After choosing the Network and the offer, go into your RedTrack account, insert the tracking link, choose the Traffic Source and get ready for the start.

What verticals do you advice to run now, while coronavirus is everywhere?

-In general, we would advise going for intangible goods first. They are less vulnerable to demand fluctuations and supply chain hurdles. So, check how's your chosen region doing.

Half a year ago, we would definitely you to look at this picture with average Push CTR by industry:

&nbsp;

But today this chart doesn't make any sense at all. The verticals worth trying list include

 	Online Education/Freelancer Jobs
 	Dating &amp; Adult
 	Healthcare and pharmaceutical
 	Communications devices
 	Gaming
 	Entertainment
 	Surveys &amp; Sweeps
 	Streaming
 	Gambling

To demonstrate campaigns set up process and tips for improving your Push Ads CTR, we chose a gambling offer. To see how it was, watch the webinar here.
OPTIMIZING YOUR PUSH ADS:

What is the biggest mistake affiliates make while launching campaign?

- One of the biggest mistakes affiliates make at the very beginning is expect millions coming into their accounts in 5 minutes after the launch. The harsh truth about all this is that, regardless of your actions, you'll lose money in almost 100% of cases. The question is how much? To lose less,  take care of creatives, targeting settings, blacklists of inefficient traffic sources, and look for some features to help you control traffic and budget losses.

1.Never choose one creative. Test 3-5 creatives per one campaign. If you are not an expert in digital marketing analytics, try A/B tests redirects and Landing Page management features. Just look at the case one of our clients sent us. Adding additional CTA at the bottom of their page increased the performance of the landing page by 18% percent.



&nbsp;
WHAT ELSE?
2. Try  Emoji and macros with geolocation 
3. Learn how people in your chosen GEO consume digital content, their habits, cultural specifics, etc. The more you know, the better.
4. If you work with mobile traffic and hesitating between Android and IoS versions, choose the latest and exclude the old ones. A good rule of thumb is that all-new operation systems tend to work better.
5. To not annoy the audience, start with 1 impression per day. To track it, first set the impression cap value inside RichPush, turn on the Impression tracking option inside your campaign setting in RedTrack,  and that's it!
6. Reduce the error price with Automation Rules.

To make sure you still didn't do any crucial mistakes in your settings, set up automation rules for your traffic. If your expected results with RichPush are not met, your traffic flow will be automatically stopped. In RichPush case, the Campaign Pause and Creative Pause Rules are available. See the whole list of integrations here. If you want to see how to set them up, request a demo, and our Product Specialists will help you with it.

 	Generally, online casinos are the most profitable sub-category. However, they highly dependent on the day and the time of day. During hyped-up sports events like the World Cup, sports betting brings in the most cash.
 	Experienced Affiliates focus on driving traffic to mobile apps because they generate a higher conversion rate.
 	





The most efficient traffic sources for the gambling vertical are SEO, context ads, Facebook, Instagram+apps, and Facebook+apps.










The most effective way to succeed with a gaming affiliate program is 





... to play it yourself first.





Top-performing GEO:












Expert advice:




When choosing the vertical or product you wish to promote it’s important to think about the user’s state of mind.
He or she did not look for the product you are promoting, but they are looking for some recommendations that are suitable for them based on their interests. Make sure you intrigue them, and give them some information in the creatives that will eventually make them click and hopefully convert.









&nbsp;

&nbsp;

4. DATING VERTICAL
Interesting facts&amp;stats about the vertical:





 	Almost any ad format is good for dating except pop-unders/click-unders. Banners, native widgets, and push are the most effective formats for dating offers.
 	Tinder, Snapchat, and other hookup apps, along with the evolution of push traffic, are moving users away from traditional dating websites. About 70% of the content in dating is offered via mobile devices 
 	The most pro table subcategories are mail-ordered brides, mature, and niche dating.






The best time to run Dating ad campaigns is





...  Christmas until the end of January. Summer is a pro table time as well unless either a World Cup football championship or the Olympic games are happening





What's trendy?









Pre-landers are being used in about 80% of ad campaigns, with 3 main ways to promote an offer:

- Interactive pre-lander (e.g. casino fortune wheel, choose a gaming character, etc.); 
- Questionnaire pre-lander (widely used in dating);
- Advertorial pre-lander (success story, mostly used in trading and gambling funnels).









Expert's advice:









There are several main factors that influence the payout of your offers: 

1. SOI or DOI offer: DOI has a higher payout of up to $20 per lead.

2. Choosing between CPS and CPA? Definitely go for CPA.
You can’t be responsible for the entire sales funnel in dating. On traffic sources, you only buy impressions. And in the CPS model, you are dependent on the quality of the product.
CPS can be a great option only when you are already familiar with the advertiser’s ow and their ability to monetize users, and they like the quality of your traffic.

3. The GEO of the user. Advertisers pay more for competitive GEOs. One of the most profitable approaches in affiliate marketing is to NOT focus on English speaking GEOs.

4. How old is your audience? The younger – the cheaper.





&nbsp;






&nbsp;

&nbsp;




5. MOBILE APPS VERTICAL




Interesting facts&amp;stats:





 	The most popular mobile apps sub-verticals today are mobile gaming and social offers. They are growing exponentially, and affiliates receive high payouts.
 	One of the most prominent mobile trends in 2020 is the trial payment model.  Mobile app conversion models that rely on cheap tricks are rapidly losing ground, giving way to strategies that can leverage quality content.
 	










Google Mobile CPC: is 41% lower than Desktop one for the same term with the same bid, copy, matchtype, network, targeting, and landing page.















The most effective way to get positive results fast is









... to start with VOD offers (Video on Demand); the content is easy to create and to purchase.









What's trendy?





Traffic on mobile devices has overtaken desktop traffic. So affiliate marketing verticals that were typically desktop products like sweeps, dating, and ecom have increasingly shifted to mobile formats. That will likely continue in the next few years.





Expert's advice:









1. Keep track of winning and losing campaigns so you can learn from what you’ve done in the past.

2. Ask your Affiliate Manager. I was an Affiliate Manager for over 15 years. AMs have access to a lot of data (but probably not as much as you sometimes think). Reach out to your Affiliate Manager for advice on what is hot or trending.

3. Use spy tools to see what other people are running. I don’t advocate completely ripping someone else’s campaign, but I do HIGHLY recommend spy tools for researching the offers and landing pages that other people are using. Anstrex and AdPlexity are my two favorite spy tools.

6428,Customer story by Adavice: Driving higher CR and ROI with RedTrack ad tracker,"Adavice | International Ad Agency | 7 years of experience 

Adavice is an international ad agency with a strong focus on mobile ads platform technology. The company was founded in 2012 and since then they've provided not just the traffic, but marketing services and their own in-house DSPs. Today, as they call themselves, they are a one-stop-shop for advertisers with offices in Eastern and Southern Europe and Asia. Their great experience, in-house tools, and extensive knowledge in global media buying let them strive in difficult times and show high results to their customers.

Challenge
It's hard to be profitable in any business if you don’t understand how to analyze your results. The good thing about digital marketing is that everything can be measured. A quality ad tracking solution makes it possible for companies to get all the right data in one place and helps to turn insights into actions. 

The Adavice team's day starts with a review of the previous day's reports. They check all the metrics of user activity in order to:
1. understand the current results they have,
2. improve future metrics and bring the current results closer to the final clients' needs.

We are working on bringing the highest possible results to our advertisers every day . We make hundreds of tests on different levels: creatives, pre-landers, landing pages, devices, etc, in order to find the best converting model. Such tests require us to set up a bunch of test campaigns, and resources to structure and analyze data at different angles.


&nbsp;
Olga Yakimaha,
Head of Supply Department,
Adavice

Solution
Before choosing RedTrack, Adavice team has tried different ad tracking solutions. But the bigger the agency becomes, the more requirements they have for the ad tracker. In the end, Adavice came to the conclusion that it needs a reliable solution, that can handle a large amount of data from different traffic sources, on one hand, and optimize all the activities related to its processing, on the other hand. That's why they came to RedTrack.io.
We do a lot of testing in order to find the best solution for our clients. Proper testing always implies working with a large amount of data from different sources. Without an ad tracker, it just took too much time for our team to structure, analyze, and visualize all the data. Before we found RedTrack, we’ve worked with several ad tracking systems, where we needed to create our own reports. So, there was still a lot of manual work, which isn’t what we were looking for.

&nbsp;

RedTrack tracking and automation features along with convenient reports made it much easier for us to make things done and gain valuable insights and trends with less efforts. All this has certainly had a positive impact on our operational efficiency as well as the quality of services we provide to our clients.
Among the generic reasons why Adavice has chosen RedTrack:
1. the ability to cover the whole range of tracking needs;
2. responsive support team which is always ready to help solve issues in a fast and friendly way,
3. reasonable pricing, which is based on usage.
&nbsp;
Why RedTrack.io?


Adavice rolled out the RedTrack platform in phases. First, they experienced all the benefits of RedTrack ad tracking features and extensive drill-down reports. Over time, they moved on to RedTrack optimization features that help clients in 107 countries manage their traffic and teams in the most effective way. Among key RedTrack benefits, Adavice team has identified the following:
- All data in one place
With RedTrack we have all advertiser and publisher stats in one place. On the one hand, It’s very comfortable, as you don't need to go back and forth between different sources. On the other hand, it significantly reduces the chance of data loss and its misinterpretation. With all this, our team can focus more on ad strategy optimization and generating fresh ideas.
- Advanced A/B testing 
Experimenting with different headlines, images, CTAs, landing pages, and pre-landers helps Adavice to find the best combinations. They use RedTrack to:


 	set-up simple and complex A/B tests in a very short time to find the winning combination,
 	rotate several offers assigned to one landing page click URL,
 	run multiple offer URLs simultaneously.

- Google Ads tracking
Google Ads is one of the main Traffic Sources Adavice use to help their clients reach their goals. For each case, they have a unique tracking method that allows them to track clicks, impressions, and conversions, depending on the specific situation:

 	Parallel Tracking when using redirects,
 	Direct Traffic Tracking, while sending Google Ads Traffic directly to landing page from one Traffic Source,
 	Multiple Direct Traffic Source, while sending Traffic from multiple Traffic Sources. It simply allows to have your organic and paid traffic stats all in one place.

Learn more: How Google Ads Traffic Tracking works.
- Multiaccess
RedTrack feature that came in handy during forced remote work period in times of COVID-19 pandemic is Multi-access feature. It allows users to work on advertising projects together effectively regardless of their location. An admin can invite team members involved in the project and specify the role for each one of them by limiting and giving access to specific RedTrack functionality.


We have 2 teams working on advertisers quality. And it is very convenient to give each team appropriate access to the stats, omitting some permissions according to each member responsibility.
&nbsp;


The Result
With the help of RedTrack ad tracking features, Adavice was able to improve the key metrics of their campaigns and improve the overall performance:



This is how Adavice could have improved their key performance metrics with the help of a/b tests:

Initially, they started testing a standard landing page with a blue background (A) which had 21% of Conversion Rate and generated ROI of 83%. They switched to a dark background that was more related to their Crypto offer. This change made the time and reaction rates much faster than with the first LP. As you may calculate, this A/B test helped Adavice to increase their personal ROI by 47%.





Ad agencies beyond ad tracking:
COVID-19 and the work of ad agencies:
The biggest changes that we see today is that advertisers are becoming more cautious and change their business processes according to newly adopted working from home policy. Aviation, travel, restaurants, leisure ads will carry immense consequences and will not be as they were before COVID-19. Major players such as Google and FB are going to lose revenues and shrink parts of their activities (which today mostly rely on the above verticals)

6525,5 RedTrack Features to Prepare for the 'New Normal',"We have to admit that the consequences of the COVID-19 will last long after the airlines will restore their flights and children go back to school. Advertisers and media buyers have to reinvent their strategies and take new approaches to manage the unexpectedly changing landscape and maintain the efficiency of their ad campaigns.

Currently, among the top demands that digital marketers claim are:

 	new effective team management and collaboration methods;
 	the data accuracy;
 	the need for costs optimization;
 	routine processes automation and optimization.

No doubt, it’s hard to handle all this alone. At RedTrack, we share the challenges digital marketers face today as 'new normal' relates to everyone. That's why we put forward 5 features that would help you to prepare for the future that is happening now with the least loss and the best result. 
1. Effective Team Collaboration with Multi-access feature 
Not only the global work-from-home movement proved its performance efficiency, but it also inspired some companies to shift to remote work forever. The ability to manage a distributed team is a must-have skill for every manager today. Ad campaigns management might seem like a challenge when it comes to remote teams until you try RedTrack multi-access feature.

With the Multi-access feature, your team members can simultaneously work with campaign data in one RedTrack account from different devices in any part of the world. There are several levels of access that you can give to your team members, depending on their role in the project: view, edit, export. You can restrict access to all financial data, campaigns, traffic sources, publishers' or advertisers' data, for example. 

&gt; Learn more: How to set up multi-access for my team. 


2. Know your audience in detail
Every day brings a whole bunch of unexpected surprises. People’s behavior and reaction to certain events are still difficult o predict, so keeping track of key metrics becomes more important than ever. The more you know about the audience, the more insights you have to make the right decisions.

With the help of RedTrack's custom dashboards, you can track the wide range of specific performance metrics important to your business. Segment your audience, group it by country, city, language, device type, or any other characteristic, analyze the stats and choose the right strategy to go for.




&nbsp;
3. Optimize your spends
Advertisers are cutting costs, some industries go into hibernation or survive a temporary lull. But, everything can be changed in an instant moment. Travel affiliate's revenues will start to grow the day their most profitable GEOs announce the opening of borders. Conversely, they will have to look for gaming offers or at least someplace in a more or less decent niche. 

With RedTrack reports, you can analyze all the data you get depending on the day, month, and the hour and compare them all. 


4. Work smarter, not harder with the help of automation
Few companies can afford to hire new assistants now. And indeed, why do this at all? With RedTrack automation features you can save up to 20% of your time, which usually falls for monitoring, stressing out,  pondering wrong decisions, and jumping back and forth between tabs and websites.

It's possible with the help of automated rules that can pause ad campaigns, placements, or creatives if the expected EPC, ROI, and CR are not met. There's no need to worry you miss the moment when something goes wrong. You'll receive notifications once set KPIs are not met or unexpectedly changed.

RedTrack can help you get rid of both types of bots: malicious and good ones. For bad bots, you can leverage our Fraud Score integration. Fraudscore will analyze all your clicks and prepare a comprehensive ad fraud statistics to let you know where you lose your money. And if you activate the Known bots toggle in your Profile Settings, RedTrack will automatically exclude 16 well-known bots from your reports by Google, Facebook, Alexa, Yahoo and others. Now is not the best time for smoking money.

Let's figure this out on the example of RedTrack.

An Ad tracker for eCommerce business

2. What can you track with a tracker? 
3. Most popular RedTrack features for e-commerce business.
4. Having an Affiliate Program. The secrets of effective management with RedTrack.
5. How to track Facebook Traffic and not get banned.
6. RedTrack features to help you work with your team.
7. How to start with RedTrack?

&nbsp;
Let’s start with the basics. What is an ad tracker?
An ad tracker is a tool that helps you track all the traffic you buy or organically receive across the web. With a tracker, you can view data on impressions, clicks, add-to-carts, and sales from each traffic source. All in one place.
Why is it important?

If people are buying products from your website, but you're not sure how and where they find you, how often they visit your store, which ad banners bring you the most profitable leads, then you simply don't know how your business works. A reliable ad tracker can give you answers to all these questions, provide insights on your customers' preferences, and help to optimize and scale your business.

&nbsp;
What can you track with a tracker?
The answer fully depends on the tool you use. RedTrack.io tracks all types of traffic and elements of your media buying campaigns to provide you with the full picture of your efforts. 

Tracking various marketing channels 
• Organic traffic. Understand the performance of your website and marketing campaigns.
• Paid traffic / PPC. Currently, RedTrack is integrated with 70+ channels like Facebook Ads,TikTok Ads, Google Ads, Bing, Revcontent, Taboola, Outbrain, Propellerads, MGID, and others.
• Social networks. Facebook, TikTok, Reddit, Snapchat, and MyTarget are integrated with RedTrack by default.
• Email traffic. Email marketing proves its efficiency for the e-com business for years. Attribute clicks from your email campaigns with conversions on your website.
Measuring the performance of your media-buying activities

 	Measuring impressions, clicks and conversions with every marketing channel you use
 	Tracking the full conversion path (like view content, add-to-cart, initiate checkout, purchase, etc.).
 	Measuring the cost of your advertising and revenue generated
 	Analyzing the performance through 30+ data points for interactions with your ads (like device type, OS type, location, language, time, etc.)
 	Comparing the results of various channels in a single dashboard
 	Syncing your Shopify or WooCommerce store with advertising channels
 	Analyzing ads for bot or fradulents activities.

Most popular RedTrack features for e-commerce business.

RedTrack.io is an ad tracking and conversion attribution platform. Handling big volumes of data, we provide tracking and analytics reports to media buyers, publishers, brands, and eCom agencies from 107 countries.

The most common reason why eCommerce businesses apply RedTrack is to get accurate conversion attribution, i.e. understand real-time which clicks and traffic sources actually bring conversions.

&nbsp;



Among the most popular features for agencies and eCom brands, are:

 	Cross-channel tracking. This means that in one UI you can see the performance of your media buying campaigns, no matter if your traffic source is Google / Bing, Facebook, Taboola, affiliate websites, etc.
 	Cookieless tracking. Cookies are already blocked by Safari and some other browsers. Soon by all or most browsers. It means that if you still rely on cookie-based tracking, you lose a lot of your data. If you need an accurate and secure way of multiple traffic source tracking, then you should apply a 3rd party tracker. RedTrack records every click and shows the whole users' path from the first touchpoint to the conversion and further. It allows you to track both organic and paid traffic simultaneously with no redirects and limitations.




 	Attribution models. When you need to identify which click resulted in a conversion ('add-to-cart' or purchase), based on your goals you might want to track:

- first-click attribution - means that a conversion is attributed to the date of the first click of a visitor, that later on might have made a number of subsequent visits that ended up in conversions.

- last click attribution - the date of the visitor's last click is attributed to the conversion.
What else?

 	Multiple post-conversion events tracking. If you work with commerce platforms, like Shopify, WooCommerce, and others, besides click and conversion tracking, you should be also interested in post-conversion events, as it may influence final ROI metrics. RedTrack offers the opportunity to add up to 10 post-conversion events and display them in your reports.
 	Easy integration with major eCom marketplaces. We have a private Shopify App, WooCommerce plugin that make it easy to connect your eCommerce platform to advertising channels.
 	Customized reports. You can fully customize the reports dashboards by adding, hiding, prioritizing the right data columns and metrics.



-&gt;  Read: How to Skyrocket your business with RedTrack Data Reports
• Automation Rules. They can save your time spending on routine tasks and save your ads budget clearing your media buying set from ineffective ideas.

• A/B testing. Run multiple tests to find the offers and landing pages that work best.

How to track Facebook Traffic and not get banned
Let’s admit that Facebook is a very specific Traffic Source. There are probably no affiliates who have never been blocked by Facebook for unknown reasons. Keeping in mind their strict terms of use, e-commerce is a great niche to promote on Facebook. But you should always be prepared for being blocked if you:


 	

 	

 	promote health/beauty products and supplements using young Facebook Ads account;
 	try split-testing;
 	try to promote adult/crypto or financial offers;






The worst thing is that in the case of blocking, you won’t get the exact reason for this. Therefore, there can be no single answer. RedTrack experienced clients often use several Traffic Sources to maximize their profit. According to our internal survey, native advertising shows the best results as an ad format for e-commerce affiliate marketing campaigns.

6650,How to get more profit with Push Ads? Tips from RichPush,"Today it becomes more and more difficult to choose the type of ads which will be both effective and catchy. Users’ “blindness” became a particularly urgent problem for all affiliate marketers, regardless of experience. One may wonder if there's a perfect ad type that can reach these high requirements we all expect it to reach? Or the game doesn't worth the candle and the affiliate marketing is really dead? Good news, there is at least one ad type that proves its efficiency with a variety of verticals - push ads. The lowest bid price, one of the highest CR (4.9% for iOS, 10.7% for Android), a wide range of GEOs available, and other cool advantages.
Now let’s see how we can generate profit here. We asked our partners from the RichAds ad network to share some tips on making money with push ads. Check the list:

 	
Set up impressions/click limits in your campaigns


Many affiliate marketers think that if they don’t pay for impressions there is no need to limit them. Indeed, in this case, an impression costs nothing. Sounds logical, but inefficient. Such an approach will bring you neither more clicks nor conversions. Why? Because it will irritate the users. Imagine yourself seeing the same ad several times a day. What will be your most likely action? Click? Buy? Ban, most likely. So, limiting impressions is important if you want to get more conversions, save the reputation of your ad account and brand you promote.

We recommend choosing 1 impression per day as an impressions limit.  

Similar logic applies to clicks limits in your ad campaigns. Don't expect your target audience to go to your landing page several times a day to make a final purchase decision. One-two times a day is enough.



&nbsp;

 	
Use more than one creative for successful optimization 


Making and choosing creatives is a kind of lottery. This skill usually comes with time and experience. Each case is individual, especially if you are keen on experimenting. The only key to learn what will work in this particular case is testing. The best strategy is to choose 3-5 different creatives for one campaign and try to identify the one with the highest CTR. If you make your first steps in affiliate marketing or starting with a new niche, you can even use up to 10 creatives. And always keep in mind the golden rule - change only one element at a time.

After you define the best working variant remake all your creatives according to this best option. Want to learn more about how A/B testing help affiliates and media-buyers to maximize their profit? Read some case studies.

&nbsp;



&nbsp;

 	
Use conversions tracking 


Clear statistics is the key to successful ad campaigns. You will hardly get any stable profit if you don't know which of the hypotheses work, when, and why. Data analysis shouldn't always be the final point of your ad campaign. If you see that something isn't going so well or your results are below the benchmark, you can always optimize your campaign and save money. The secret of accurate statistics lies in your ad tracker choice. A good one will provide you with detailed information about your campaigns and customers (device, language, OS, etc) and their targeted actions ( conversions, transactions, statuses). 

Today there are 3 ways of conversion tracking: postback, image, and pixel. We recommend using postback as is one of the most credible ways as the data about a user and his actions will go directly to the advertiser's, ad tracker's, and affiliate network's servers.

As RichAds ad network is integrated with RedTrack, you can start enjoying all the benefits of quality ad tracking and push traffic right now.

 	
Disable non-converting sources during optimization 



This step is one of the most important during optimization. If any website doesn’t bring conversions it means that it doesn't have your target audience and you just leak your budget. You will pay for clicks and just waste money instead of getting high-quality traffic for a reasonable price. With Richpush you can easily blacklist ineffective sources.
To do it you need to understand the levels on which you can implement this function. There are 3 of them: website, publisher, and sublist (see the scheme below). Sublists consist of publishers, publishers, in their turn, consist of multiple websites. The get the most out of the non-converting sources blacklisting feature you need to constantly monitor your performance and update the list of traffic sources that worsen your statistics.


 	
Pay attention to the optimization of devices


There are two main types of traffic affiliates and media-buyers work with - mobile and desktop. They suggest completely different strategies and suggest different user behavior. Here are some good examples:

 	Average mobile bounce rate is around 45%,  desktop - 38%,
 	65% of all digital media time is spent on mobile devices,
 	Users spend more time on mobile but spend more money on a desktop.If you don’t divide these types of traffic into two separate campaigns, your statistics may not be fully correct. After that, you will see which one works better with your offer and will disable non-converting traffic type via targeting option.

Speaking about mobile traffic, new operation systems tend to work better. Target Android 8,9, or 10 and profit will be forthcoming.

6878,5 tips on how to increase your CTR and earn more,"Research has shown that even post-lockdown people will continue to use digital services at a rate higher than before, so placing your ads on online platforms, no matter how small or big they are, is a great way to earn some extra income. However, that doesn’t necessarily mean that your ads will be seen (or clicked on) by more people. As Internet users become more tech savvy, they find more ways to hide or avoid advertisements. AdBlock, selective blindness, you name it… Most publishers and advertisers have suffered losses because of this. Are your revenues falling? Are you afraid that soon you won’t be getting any ad clicks? 
We’ve asked our friends and partners at Adsterra, a global ad network that has monthly traffic of over 30 billion, for a few tips on how to retain - and increase - your CTR and profit. 

1. Accessibility is key
This is nothing new, but make sure your ads are optimized for every device. To reach the maximum number of users, ads have to be available on every platform and operating system. Recently, the number of people who exclusively use their smartphones to surf the net has surged, so don’t only focus on desktop – optimizing ads for mobile is important, too. It is notoriously hard to reach iOS users, so make sure your chosen network knows how to work with this operating system.


2. Make your ads interesting
While normal banner ads have their purpose and their audience, they’ve been around for a while and most people either use 3rd party software to hide them or have learnt to ignore them. Your ads should be interesting enough that users want to pay attention to them. For example, you could increase CTR and grow ROI by transforming your campaigns with up-to-date ad formats (animations, carousels, countdowns, videos, etc). At the same time, you have to make it non-intrusive – users can get annoyed if the ad is too distracting and tampers with their ability to interact with the content they visited the website for. Another way this could be achieved is by making the ads appear as a native part of a website, for instance as a live chat icon or surveys.

Another way this could be achieved is by making the ads appear as a native part of a website, for instance as a live chat icon or surveys.
3. Personalize your ads
As we’ve mentioned previously, users don’t like to be distracted when they’re interacting with content. Therefore, advertisements that don’t look like they are a native part of the webpage can garner a negative reaction. One way to avoid this is to tailor ads to a specific platform and audience, both visually and content-wise. Carry out research or use the latest tech to find out more about your target audience. Then, customize the ads as much as you can, adjusting creatives, formats, messages displayed, even colors! If you feel lost reading this, contact one of Adsterra’s managers to learn what settings will be the best fit for you. 


4. Take advantage of the latest tech
At Adsterra, we value innovation and are always on top of the latest technology trends – and you should do the same. Users use the latest tech to hide advertisements, so in turn, you should be using the latest tech to make sure your ads are seen. Most importantly, prioritize services that counteract AdBlock. Additionally, AI-based technology can help you finetune your ad settings as well as filter out bot traffic. 
5. Test extensively
Do not finalize any decisions until you carry out extensive testing. Don’t be afraid to mix and match different ad formats, creatives, targeting options as well as settings but try to always test each new configuration to make sure you will be getting maximum CR and profit.

➤➤ Don’t forget about yourself. As important as it is to finetune your ads to maximize profit, your experience as a user also matters. Setting up your ad campaigns shouldn’t be a struggle or take multiple hours. Additionally, do not hesitate to look for help if you need it – it is always useful to head an outside perspective, and a piece of advice from a professional manager at the right time can multiply your earnings.

With Adsterra, you get access to all the above and more. Their newly launched ad format called Social Bar offers all the features we’ve talked about in this article. You can read more about it on their website: link.

6930,How to make your campaigns work within budget? Bidding strategy for pop!,"Depending on how experienced you are, there are different steps you take in preparation for running campaigns. You need to think about the right offer, a quality traffic source, an ad tracker, and ad creatives before you actually get down to business. But... How much money should you prepare? What is a good affiliate marketing budget for running pop traffic campaigns? 

Affiliate marketing requires investment before you start making profits. So if you want to find out how to make your campaigns work within a budget, and what bidding strategy to use to save money with pop traffic, read effective tips form our partner Zeropark. Enjoy!
The Optimal Monthly Affiliate Marketing Budget for Pop Campaigns
The most important expense in affiliate marketing is traffic. To prepare an adequate budget you need to take into consideration the campaign’s vertical, geo-targeting, and the offer payout.

In Zeropark, advertisers can set total campaign budgets, daily budgets, as well as specific placements caps — source and target daily budgets. These caps let you limit the total amount of money you are willing to spend on a chosen portion of traffic within a 24-hour time range. If you’d like to keep spending without any limit, you can always go for the ‘unlimited’ budget.

Zeropark recommends setting $100 as their daily budget: $20 for a source budget, and $5 for chosen targets (also called target IDs or site IDs, depending on the traffic source). But if you’re a little bit short of the suggested sums, don’t worry! Pops are a forgiving ad format. You can make it work with a smaller budget (low payout offer + Tier 3 GEO could work with half the recommended budget or less). Just don’t forget to spread it evenly throughout the month. 
Some other important things:
1. Maintain the cash flow so that you let your campaigns run consistently and without long breaks. Let’s do the math now:  $100 multiplied by 30 days (the regular number of days in a pay period) gives you approximately $3000.

2. Affiliate networks don’t immediately allow you to withdraw your earnings, though. Depending on your experience and relationship with the network, the waiting period before you can make a withdrawal can range between 1 and 30 days. If you are a beginner, then most likely you will need to wait a month before collecting your first earnings. That means your initial budget should be doubled. 

So, how much money do you need to invest in traffic? More or less $3000 should give you a very good start running pop traffic. In case of the low payout offers, you could do well with less, and for high payout offers… the bigger the budget the better. 

An offer from an affiliate network and a traffic source to buy traffic are the only essentials you need to start media buying. But it’s not really possible to achieve success without additional tools.  
Additional Affiliate Marketing Expenses:
Even though the majority of your budget should go into buying traffic, there are other things you need to account for in the list of your monthly expenses. Let me tell you about the optional tools you might want to consider.
Affiliate Ad Tracker
The most important additional tool is an affiliate ad tracker. You can start a campaign without a tracking solution, but you can’t optimize it without one. Having no granular data insights into what works and what doesn’t means your chances of success are rather slim. Monthly tracker prices range from free to nearly thousands of dollars, but going for more expensive options can be extremely beneficial. Additional features offered by trackers improve ROI and help you optimize your campaigns to profitability. 

Pro tip: you can reduce your monthly expenses by choosing the annual billing option. 

Stop wasting your money. Start tracking your campaigns. Try RedTrack Now.


Useful Tools In Affiliate Marketing
Other tools that can make your affiliate marketing career easier and more successful are spy tools and lander builders. Spy tools let you research the market and draw inspiration from how other people are running their campaigns. Landing page builders, on the other hand, allow you to create your own, unique landing pages that can perform really well in a market saturated with similar ideas.

Don’t forget to localize your landers by translating them to the language of the GEO where you run your ads. Translation services are usually very cheap but can significantly improve your results. Landers that are easily understood by the audience will usually convert better. If you’re worried about additional costs of translation, you can always go for the less accurate, albeit free option of using Google Translate.

What if you have a very tight affiliate marketing budget? Besides choosing the annual billing options you can also join community forums where experienced affiliates share free resources and useful tips. For the small price of a monthly forum subscription, you get access to landers, creatives, and help in translations from community members. Just the kind of support that can be invaluable to a beginner!


Bidding Strategy for Pop Traffic
When you’ve got your campaigns ready, now it’s time to let the traffic flow. But how to make your campaigns work without throwing away your budget?

When setting campaign bids, you should always go slightly above the suggested bid. Traffic source says $0.004? You should start at $0.0045. That way you can make sure you have a competitive advantage right at the start.

The next step is to let your campaign run for a couple of hours and watch the win ratio of each source. Once you’ve spent a portion of your daily budget, you should review the results and bid upon the sources that have a win ratio below 50%. If the sources with a low win ratio happen to be profitable already, you shouldn’t change the bids just yet. 

Yes, you’re reading it right. While spending more money might seem contradictory to ‘staying within budget,’ it’s actually making sure you get the most out of the testing period. 

The point of this strategy is to adjust the bid based on the win ratio and profitability. Poor performing sources with low win ratio only have access to cheaper and less attractive placements. So, by bidding upon such sources you access higher quality placements and a wider audience. By expanding the reach, you make sure your ads are easily accessible and displayed to enough people to catch someone’s attention. And that’s when the conversions start flooding in!

If one of your sources is winning 100% of traffic, then you might try to slowly decrease the bid to see if you can keep the source profitable with slightly less exposure. 
Optimization Tips for Pop Traffic
Pop traffic is perceived as inexpensive and easy to learn, and therefore perfect for beginners. Landers are often provided to you by the affiliate network, hence, all you need to do is buy traffic and optimize the campaigns so that they spend less and earn more. Here are some useful optimization tips to help you get the most out of your campaigns:

 	Let your campaigns run for 3-4 days before deciding to limit targeting options.
 	While optimizing pop traffic, start with devices and then move on to OSes and OS versions.
 	Don’t cut sources or targets until they’ve reached a 70-90% win ratio and are still not profitable. 
 	Make whitelists out of profitable sources and placements, and run separate source/target campaigns.
 	Always test more than one landing page. 
 	Using landers provided by the affiliate network is quick and easy, but creating your own landers gives you a competitive advantage!
 	It’s also best to test more than one offer at once. Try starting with 5 offers and after two days stop those that have ROI lower than -50%.
 	Don’t forget to set the source and target daily affiliate marketing budgets. Make sure you get all the traffic without spending too much on a single placement. 
 	Don’t be scared to kill the campaign if you see it hasn’t been performing for too long. Getting too attached might cost you a lot of money.
 	Find your niche and stick to it. You should change the offer if it doesn’t perform well but rather than trying something completely different, try to learn one particular niche. 

Looking for high-quality traffic recommended by professionals?


When To Kill A Campaign?
Staying within budget can be difficult when you see the campaigns are close to turning profitable, and yet it never happens. So, how to determine a good moment to kill a campaign?

You need to take into consideration more things than just the performance of the campaigns. Your campaign has been running for a while and went from green to red? It might be because of market saturation. Are you outbid (lower win ratio)? Increase the bid, and if you think it’s creative fatigue - rotate more creatives!

If you are unsure whether your creatives were a good choice, you can always ask your traffic source representatives about the current trends. They know what lenders perform well and can check yours too to see if they have potential. 
Avoid Mistakes

 	Make sure your tracking is set up correctly and that your targeting is in agreement with the affiliate network requirements.
 	If you’ve only just launched your campaigns, the traffic is slowly coming in, you’ve spent a couple of dollars and are disappointed to see a negative ROI - you shouldn't kill the campaign just yet! The general rule is to wait until you spent 5 times the payout before pausing the campaign.
 	You can choose an aggressive strategy — test a lot of offers and landers at once, and kill them if they don’t perform within the first couple of days or a more steadfast strategy in which you take the time to optimize the campaigns that show a little bit of potential at the start. 

The key is to keep testing and keep launching more campaigns. In the end, one of those campaigns will be your getaway to success. 

Conclusions

 	Whatever your initial budget is, the biggest chunk of it should be spent on traffic. 
 	A good medium-range initial daily budget for pop is $100, but it can be lower in case of low payout offers run in Tier 3 GEOs and higher in case of high payout offers run in Tier 1 GEOs.
 	Remember to spread your budget evenly to run your campaigns without breaks.
 	Additional tools are very useful, but not all of them are necessary right from the start. 
 	As a beginner, you should consider investing in affiliate marketing forums subscriptions as they’re full of free resources and helpful experienced affiliates.
 	Remember to increase your bids slowly based on the win ratio of your sources and targets.
 	Don’t be too hasty in killing campaigns! Try changing bids and creatives before you make that choice.

6993,Referral marketing Part 1: 5 Strategies to earn more,"Referral marketing is a tactic to get customers to tell their friends about your product. The best thing about it is that it's an organic process and therefore has a high ROI with low risk. One person who likes the product recommends it to others, and then it all becomes viral. A brand gets an effective acquisition channel and referrals, in turn, win trust in their environment and improve their personal brands.

You can read all this in the books written by smiling optimistic authors, who had experience with several well-established brands and or had none at all. In today's world, having a good product to build a good word of mouth marketing strategy is not enough. If the referral process is not managed, it can quickly go into decline. To avoid it, companies encourage their customers to spread the word about their product with special rewards and additional privileges. This is how referral programs are typically created.
How brands use referral programs
Today you'll see Referral Program Tab on almost every reputable company's website. Large brands are also not averse to saving on user acquisition costs. Let's look at the classic examples of the most well-known referral programs.
Google G Suite 

For those who are not familiar with Google business services, this one is a suite of various cloud computing productivity and collaboration products. Its Referral Program includes the following awards:

 	$ 15 for each user that signs up for G Suite Basic plan;
 	$ 30 for a sign up into G Suite Business or G Suite Enterprise plan;
 	up to $ 3,000 per each domain.


Airbnb
Even if you've never booked a place at Airbnb, you definitely heard about this rental marketplace. To get more users, they came up with the idea which benefited three parties at once: the brand itself, a referrer, and a referral:

Members of the referral program can earn their Travel Credits - discounts - for future trips in two ways:

 	if he's referral clicks on the referral link and register to the website;
 	in case he completes a Reservation using the link. The referral link usually gives up to $30 credits to the referral.
A win-win-win case as it is.

Tesla
Not only mass user products play in referral programs. Premium ones are also in the game. Tesla has already changed its referral program conditions several times. Right now they have two different referral programs for their two brands:


Cars
The referral link allows you and your referrals to earn 1,000 miles of free Supercharging with the purchase of a new Tesla. Each new referral increases your chances of winning a Model Y monthly or Roadster quarterly. 

Solar panels
A referer gets $ 400 for each solar referral and a Powerwall if brings 10+ customers. Referrals who use your referral link can earn a $100 after system activation or Solar Roof. 

&nbsp;



Referral marketing vs Affiliate Marketing. What's the difference?
Even though both Affiliate and Referral marketing relies upon incentives to drive new customers' revenue, their underlying core mechanisms are different.

Affiliate marketing focuses on 3rd-party advocates to send new clients to their business for a fixed fee, while referral marketing is focused on rewarding their own customers to bring new ones. Want to try both of them? No problems. But make sure you're not working with two competing brands. 

Affiliate marketing compensation models have been known for a long time. The most popular ones include

 	PPS (Pay per Sale). Everything is pretty obvious here. If your activities lead to a sale, you receive the pre-agreed commission;
 	PPA (Pay per Action). In this case, a company pays you for each active user who completes the desired action on the website or in the app. It can be anything from creating a new account, signing up for a newsletter, downloading an e-book, etc.
 	PPC (Pay per Click).  Every time a user clicks on the desired link, the commission is issued by your merchant.
 	PPM (Pay per Mile). This concept works the same as the previous one only requires payment based on a thousand views.
 	etc.

But what about Referral Programs?
How can you earn with Referral Marketing?
In the case of referral programs you can earn awards for each new customer you bring to the company using your personal link. Unlike Affiliate Marketing, your award may not always be a material one. They can come in many forms:

 	Money as it is;
 	Special Discounts and bonuses;
 	Free Subscription Months;
 	Free products;
 	Early access;
 	Custom rewards.

In RedTrack, for example, we combine two types of awards: 15% lifetime commission for each deal and custom awards for a certain number of clients brought. 



We tried to make our custom rewards useful for media-buyers. They can

 	get additional bonuses from different services to save budget and create more effective offers;
 	receive access to the community to deepen their knowledge and meet  the right people;
 	get special conditions for RedTrack use for themselves and their referrals;

receive additional promo as RedTrack Partners and boost their brand awareness.

How to get more customers and earn more?
1. The most important thing is to choose the right product that you know well or use

If it's sophisticated software like RedTrack, it will be hard to promote it if you haven't tried it by yourself. For this purpose, we have a 14-days Free Trial with access to all our advanced ad tracking and optimization features.
2. Don't be afraid of SMBs
While some may think, small companies are harder to promote, in fact, it can be the other way around. SMBs have a narrower target audience with more or less homogeneous needs. Big companies, in their turn, may offer smaller payouts and less meaningful awards. Moreover, competition is often tougher in the second case.

Before signing up for the program, check it for the following things:

 	Detailed awards description;
 	Clear conditions for receiving awards;
 	Unambiguous Terms &amp; Conditions;
 	The brand's reputation. At least check reviews on websites like Captera or Trustpilot;
 	Social media presense.

3. Try to avoid head-on sales. Tell stories
Any Reference is more advice than a sale. In real life, you can't just drop a product's website URL with a CTA to your friends and expect them to go and buy it. They will definitely want to know your experience with the product and why you think this product is for them. Pack the answers to the questions into a catchy story. Incorporate them into your blog post, share with the social media community, tell it on forums or try to put it in an ad creative.
4. Be honest
If you really refer the product to someone you know, don't hide the fact that you will also benefit from the deal. Sooner or later they will find out about it anyway and it can be pretty awkward. So, be honest from the very beginning. Tell them not only about the benefits but product shortcomings as well. You can learn about RedTrack advantages and bottlenecks in 30 minutes on a free demo with the product specialist.



 hbspt.cta.load(7519541, 'ef490f48-8ab0-4913-8668-57716f5d0600', {}); 
5. Read customer stories

7037,[Free Report] Ecommerce During and After COVID-19,"2020 has become a shocking year for many businesses. Ecommerce isn’t an exception. While some companies have experienced unprecedented revenue growth, others have appeared on the verge of bankruptcy. Due to COVID-19 consequences, many people became unemployed and economic growth slowed down. All this led to purchasing power decrease. Does it mean that after all the restrictions removal, bad times will come for ecommerce?

The question is difficult and still there's no single answer to it. Taking into account the number of ecommerce businesses that started using RedTrack since the beginning of the pandemic, we conducted our own research to define current and future trends in the industry and helped ecommerce find growth points. You can find all of them in our  E-commerce during and after COVID Report.

 hbspt.cta.load(7519541, '9ffb8565-fc1b-42ba-b4dd-1e4771ebfd81', {}); 

&nbsp;

Here are some insights on what we’ve found out:


1. Size matters. Big brands increased their influence and financial indicators, while small and medium ones found themselves in a difficult state
Chinese, USA and European market leaders only strengthened their positions and increased sales by 20% or even twice, despite supply chain disruptions. Amazon saw 26% growth in revenue, Pinduoduo - 44% revenue growth (yOy) in 3 months of lockdown. But smaller companies had a harder time. They had to deal with unexpected conversions and revenue drops along with unpredictable user behavior.




&nbsp;
What to do if you're not Amazon, Alibaba, or Wayfair?
To stay afloat small and medium-size ecommerce businesses need to go deep into people’s behavior and predict demand. The surest way is to use a quality ad tracker to analyze people’s behavior in countries that return to “normal” life earlier than others. Today the market offers a large variety of ad tracking tools that help you consolidate ad data across various organic and paid channels and turn them into valuable insights and actions. RedTrack, for example, allows you to consolidate all your data across various marketing channels, keep track of all the crucial metrics, and decide where to invest your budget to get the best possible ROI.

 	
 The change in demand forced users to refocus their strategies and reallocate resources


A lot of brands cut their budgets as demand for their products fell significantly. On the one hand, advertising budgets cut led to CPM, and CPC decrease in major RTB-platforms and opened up many new opportunities for digital marketers. But, on the other hand, this resulted in oversaturation in certain industries. As we can see from the graph below, the demand for such categories as hobbies&amp;leisure, books &amp; literature, health, and people &amp; society categories has grown the most.



What should small and medium-size ecommerce businesses do?

Ecommerce businesses should try to reorganize their businesses in the shortest possible time, investing in in-demand offers. Otherwise, there's no better way than pause ad campaigns for a while and cut costs. The second option is not so bad as it might seem at first glance. A temporary pause will help empower your offers to boost sales as soon as the situation stabilizes. That's what travel, luxury, and going out businesses did. You can invest your time in your past ad data analysis, find new insights for future growth, test hypotheses, improve products, and improve organic traffic. The key factor of success, in this case, is a clear understanding of your audience's interests and needs and the ability to create and deliver valuable content to them. How can you find out what your audience likes the most? Do A/B tests , define the best offers, messages, creatives, landers, and ads.
3. Don't focus on the negative consequences. Focus on Positive Trends
Yes, many ecommerce business owners and affiliate marketers are demotivated by the unclear economic situation, increased market saturation, and the loss of a stability sense. Because of this, they do not see many positive factors, which indicate that ecommerce industry has all the chances for quick recovery. What are the factors we're talking about right now?

 	People spend much more time online. On the one hand, this contributes to the growth of organic traffic. On the other hand, this contributes to the formation of new consumption habits. Online shopping is preferred by a large number of people now;
 	Nevertheless, the CR dropped, CPL campaigns now offer a lot of opportunities. You can create a stable loyal audience now in order to convert it into buyers in the future;
 	The offers landscape became more diverse: more offline products became part of online reality. This, in turn, opens up more opportunities for the implementation of your creative ideas;
 	With the decreased price, some products become easier to sell. Use promo codes, create special offers, and track their effectiveness.


What should small and medium-size ecommerce businesses do now to take advantage of all these opportunities?
In this situation, the price of an error for business increased by times. The data-driven approach can save an e-commerce business from big losses and help it keep up in a long- and short-term perspective. In particular, this applies to the usage of accurate statistics in the implementation and optimization of marketing and advertising campaigns.

Reliable data analysis is crucial as it gives a detailed picture of all ecommerce media-buying activities: from the first touch-point of your customer to their post-conversion activities. It can help you improve your product and marketing metrics and abandon low ROI activities.

The process of getting accurate data can be significantly eased with a reliable ad tracker. It not only helps you with all ad tracking activities, but assist with optimization, reporting and automation of related business processes.

7064,[Guest Post] The Ultimate Guide to Copywriting for Affiliate Marketing,"Copywriting is an important skill for every affiliate marketer. This industry heavily relies on the power of words and persuasion. The more advanced the product you work with is, the more significant this skill becomes.

This is why we have prepared this copywriting guide for all affiliate marketing professionals who want to increase their profits. Here are some of the most important aspects to pay attention to when you’re crafting your copy:

 	
Target and segment your audience precisely


When you want to create the content of any kind, the most important thing is to know in detail is who your target audience is. This will make it much easier to create precise content more efficiently. This is even an aspect to be taken into account since ignorance of this aspect can quickly bring about negative results.

Neightan White, a writer and content creator at SupremeDissertations, says: “When you write for everyone, you are not really writing for anyone. Even though it seems counter-intuitive, opening up the relevancy of your writing to a large number of people will not make more people connect to it. Narrow down your audience as much as you can.” 

Generally, a target audience wants to read about certain topics according to their interests. So, to achieve good results, it is necessary to write about certain topics that are interesting to that particular audience, and not just to anyone. In simple terms, it's about finding out what your next target audience will be interested in reading about. 



&nbsp;

 	
Personalization and tailoring to the specific brand


The most important thing, in this case, is to know the difference between the different brands you must work with. Therefore, it does not give good results to always publish the same type of content in all companies. On the contrary, it is useful to know the different individualities and needs of the products of each company.

To do this, the content to be created must simply coincide naturally and smoothly with the particular theme of the company. In this way, customers will be happy, but above all, readers will be interested in it. 

To understand what the most important point for the company in question is, it is necessary to know the values and the different products. When you do this, then you can create more assertive content.

 	
Use social networks correctly and wisely


One of the most relevant sectors for any company is the use of social networks. Here, it is possible to efficiently develop affiliate marketing together with a group of followers. In this way, it is also necessary to follow the main and most important trends of the moment. So, this can be useful to talk about them and get more followers.

On the other hand, nowadays, there are a lot of tools that allow you to create really attractive content for social networks. This can bring positive results since it is not the same content that is usually published on websites.

 	
Harvest the power of keywords


One of the most essential and best-known aspects is the use of the keyword within the content. Here it is not a question of including just any kind of keyword, but it is necessary to acquire a certain level of precision. In this case, these aspects will allow you to obtain a greater number of followers and readers.

The moment you get the exact keywords, then your website will be better positioned in the search engines. Many tools can help to get the most appropriate keywords.

&nbsp;



&nbsp;

 	
Check your content


There is a set of tools that can be very useful to obtain professional-level content. Each of these tools will allow you to correct and edit some words of all the content.

Some of the best-known writing and editing tools and services are TrustMyPaper (a professional writing website), Grammarly (AI-powered grammar and spelling checker), TopEssayWriting (a professional essay writing website) and ProWritingAid (a proofreading tool similar to Grammarly). 

Either of these options will provide you with the possibility of minimizing grammatical or spelling errors. So, this is an additional way to automate the review and thus save some time.

 	
Quality or quantity?


One aspect that can be somewhat confusing for many content creators is the greater importance of quality or quantity. So here we can mention in simple words that the quality of the content is much more important than the length.

In this sense, here, we include the writing style and the selection of topics to be included in each piece of content. This is why a good level of research can reap excellent results with each client. 

It is something similar that usually happens with the links that are included in a text. Here, too, good results are not achieved when there are too many links of regular quality. Instead, it is necessary to include a few links that are good and new.

When an author does this, then he or she can get a better ranking in the various search engines that readers use. Search engine algorithms have become much more sophisticated since the early days of the internet. Now, they recognize high-quality content much more easily, and they are more likely to rank it higher. 

Also, the number of readers who choose this type of content also increases considerably. So quality is not a secondary aspect that should be left aside, but actually, the basis on which the success of your copywriting is built. 

&nbsp;
Conclusion
These are the golden rules that will help you achieve the best results with your copywriting for affiliate marketing. However, there are still many tiny aspects, details, and tips that will make your copy pop. The best thing you can do is test how your copy performs with a real audience. This is where you will get the most insight and information about what your audience likes and dislikes.

7074,Ad Trackers: 5 reasons your business needs it now,"The digital marketing industry becomes more and more complicated each month. Today having a strong team of SEO-gurus or affiliate marketers isn’t enough to get a growing flow of qualified leads. The competition is growing, the rules of the game are constantly changing, and the audience is becoming more and more demanding. The standard promotion methods don't bring the expected results. The expert advice is not so effective in practice. Then, where should media-buying teams look for the growth points, you may ask? Data, of course.

There’s a large number of digital marketing analytics tools available on the market nowadays. Free and paid ones. Reliable and the ones that seem OK for the first time. While some are trying to make the most out of the basic functionality of free tools, others rely on advanced professional tools, striving to get measurable positive results as soon as possible. 

Why the latter achieve the desired results much more often and faster? Well, there are 5 main reasons for that:
1. Ad trackers help you keep all your marketing activities in one place
There's a myriad of ways you can promote your product with the help of organic and paid acquisition channels:

 	Blog posts;
 	Social media communities;
 	PPC;
 	Forums and social media communities;
 	SEO;
 	Webinars and Videos … here's probably not even a tenth of all.

How can you compare their effectiveness and know what works and what doesn't? How can you decide which channels bring you the most revenue and which ones are worth giving up? Today, all decent services have their in-built analytics solutions. That's why many digital marketers and media-buyers still try to export all these stats from different workarounds in one Excel file and get valuable insights from it. But there are some problems here:


 	Different tools have different attribution models, so the comparison may be imprecise and irrelevant;
 	You need to spend a lot of time to transfer all the information in one place;
 	Different sources can provide you with different sets of traffic metrics so that you can’t make the comprehensive and quality analysis.

 The advantages of an ad tracker here are:


 	The maximum data accuracy;
 	All data is collected in one way and in one place;
 	You don’t need to spend a lot of time trying to combine information from various workspaces.



Feel free to experiment with various Traffic Sources and Affiliate Networks. The ad tracker will take care of the rest. RedTrack has a smooth integration with more than 70 Traffic Sources (including, Google, Facebook, Bing, Tik Tok, Outbrain, Revcontent, MGID, PropellerAds, etc.) and allows you to add your custom ones in seconds. Visit our comprehensive Video Guides to see how it works in practice.

&nbsp;
2. Save money on unprofitable ad campaigns
Keeping track of data in different sources takes time. If big budgets are at stake, every minute can be fatal. With an ad tracker, you can get it all in real-time and find problems in your funnel right after the click, conversion, or transaction was made by a user. Besides, there are automation-based technologies that can help you with this task in the most effective way. How?

Here is RedTrack's example. To date, it has API-integrated more than 20 Traffic Sources that allow you to auto-optimize your traffic flow in three different ways. Based on the given conditions - EPC, ROI, CR for a given time - they can pause

 	Campaigns;
 	Placements;
 	Creatives, when the conditions are not met.

Ones it's done, the Traffic will be automatically redistributed to your high performing variables and you'll be immediately notified about these changes. Even if the desired Traffic Source isn’t integrated with RedTrack via API, you may take advantage of RedTrack alerts and get notified the moment your performance drops. Want to see how everything works?

&nbsp;
3. Increase ROI scaling your best practices
Different businesses require you to focus on different metrics. But let's be honest: the ultimate goal of any of them is to drive conversions. Whether you’re an e-commerce business, a small media publisher, or a media buying team you want your users to click on these banners and buttons, which you tested so diligently. The motivation is simple here.

But when it comes to ROI measurement, it's not as simple as it may seem at first sight. There is always a danger of relying too much on overly oversimplified data. If you start focusing too much on sales numbers, you may overlook the effectiveness of your content or social media marketing strategies, which can't be measured immediately and directly. 

Ad trackers provide you with multiple ways of Return on Investment measurement, so you can get a more accurate picture of what’s happening with your campaigns. In RedTrack you can choose your specific campaigns and analyze it by 30+ metrics over time, sort them out, and create custom reporting dashboards.



These detailed reports help you minimize the time spent on making ad investment decisions and choose the best scenario. 

&nbsp;
4. Get rid of bot traffic and save your money
Approximately 14% of all PPC campaign clicks are related to bot traffic. This in turn has a great impact on campaign metrics and creates wasted spend. Sophisticated human-like bots can easily replicate our actions: scroll pages, ads clicks, apps installs. As a result, sales teams follow up false leads, and retargeting campaigns are directed to a non-existent audience. 

Keep in mind that there are two bot types:

 	Good ones, which automate tasks and make the online experience better;
 	Bad ones, which are typically used by fraudsters to steal financial data, carry out web scraping and DDOS attacks. Basic tracking tools can help you get rid of only a small amount of bot traffic. Advanced solutions are often integrated with specific anti-fraud tools. They are characterized by regular updates and sophisticated technology. To protect users from paying for suspicious clicks and show them the real picture of their performance, RedTrack has integrated FraudScore technologies  - an advanced Fraud Fighting Platform. Now users have separate reports on the quality of traffic they buy and the ratio of the bot and human traffic. 




Moreover, RedTrack can easily track good bots as well. Algorithms will automatically detect and exclude clicks and conversions generated by 16 well-known bots by Google, Facebook, BaiduSpider, Yahoo from your reports.

&nbsp;
5. Test campaigns to get the best results the easiest way
What distinguishes a good digital marketer from a bad one? The ability to conduct A/B tests. When you try to reach a new audience or promote a new product, you can barely know what will work at the very beginning. By testing your ideas, you can see which one attracts more interaction and conversions from your customers.

Ad trackers usually provide you with advanced A/B testing options. In RedTrack it's Multi-offer and Landing Page Rotation, which allow you to:

 	rotate offers assigned to landing page click URL;
 	run multiple offer URLs simultaneously – good for e-com, listicles, and offer walls. With this, thanks to cookie-less tracking technology, you can be sure that all the data is gathered correctly. That's why this option becomes a must-have if you work with a small amount of Traffic, where each user click becomes worth its weight in gold.

7111,5 Tips to reduce your ad costs,"Among the reasons people start looking for ad trackers include the desire to see how well they can work with the audience, convert a target user to a sale or an application download. In this case, the main tasks of any reliable ad tracker is to help customers identify what they are doing right and wrong, find growth points and rooms for improvements.

In this blog post we gathered 5 main tips that helped a whole bunch of affiliates and media-buyers improve their campaigns effectiveness and cut ad costs.

Okay, how can I improve the effectiveness of my campaigns?

Well, the first thing you should do is to learn how to work with the data you get in your reports. There may be a lot of metrics out there and you actually might not need most of them. If you’re responsible for the whole business, you might be interested in ROI (return on investment). If you’re worried about the effectiveness of your media-buying activities, ROAS (return on ad spends) should be more useful for you.

Okay, what’s the difference between them? And which one should you use?
Measuring the effectiveness of your ads. ROAS vs ROI
In fact, ROAS is very similar to ROI. However, ROI is considered to be a more strategic metric that calculates the Profit generated by ad campaigns relative to their Costs. ROAS, in its turn, is more about tactics and demonstrates gross revenue generated for each dollar spent on advertising.

Compare:

ROI = profits-costs x 100 / costs;
ROAS = revenue from ad campaign / cost of ad campaign.

As you may have mentioned, ROAS is a more advertising-oriented metric, while ROI – business-centric one and considers ad spends as a basis for profit growth. Most media-buyers use both of them interchangeable, calculating either in Excel or simply exporting from ad trackers. It’s up to you which way of data analysis to choose. But, if anything, you can always get the desired values from RedTrack reports for each of your campaigns and each paid or organic source you chose.
1. Get to know your audience better
Let’s suppose you know who’s the best audience for your offer is and how to manage the right targeting settings. Are you sure you know which message you should tell them? Is there any audience feedback that can prove your headlines, texts, images and CTAs resonates with your audience. Well, if not, we advise you to do your homework before starting any campaign.

How to do it fast and easy?

 	Go to forums, social media communities and check what your audience is talking about, how they describe the problem your offer solves and which words they use. Pay attention to what they say about your competitors. Maybe you’ll get a lot of ideas for new branded ads.
 	Go and see what your audience is searching for on mobile or on the web. Try different angles while searching. Ad campaigns with words such as “smartphone”, “phone”, “mobile device,” may have different results and result in different ROI values

2. Put your customers intent at the forefront


It’s clear that to convert users into customers effectively, you should consider different messages for different sales funnel stages. There are three main message categories you can create based on your customer purpose. They can be

 	Navigational;
 	Informational;
 	Transactional.

Testing keywords with the same intent in one campaign will help you find the most effective one and avoid spending too much on unprofitable hypotheses.

A user that conducts an informational search usually responds to a whitepaper or webinar offer better than to the detailed branded list with your competitors comparison. On the other hand, those leads who can define their problem and know what might help them to solve it, will have a better reaction to a promo code than to a stylish page with general information and competitive advantages of your product.
3. Know the best Time
One of the toughest things that a newbie has to cope with is that ad campaigns will not always be profitable. Checking the stats every 10 seconds, constantly trying to apply changes in settings in hope for better results won’t help reach the desired outcome.

In fact, the haste and impatience are your high ROAS  biggest enemies. Before starting a campaign, try to find the average metrics for your industry and stick to these numbers. Your metrics will always fluctuate, but it’s ok. The most important thing is not to miss the moment of your campaign burnout.

To control it, you can use some advanced  instruments that will help you save your time and resources by automating your routine activities. RedTrack instruments that can help you do it are called Auto-Rules. Simply pick the time frame and the desired ROI, EPC, CR. If the requirements are not met, the campaign will be automatically stopped and your traffic will be redistributed to a better performing campaigns, creatives or offers.
4. Create Stronger Retargeting
Retargeting is one of the most powerful growth points for any online business, whether it’s an ecommerce store which tries to return shopping cart abandonments or a B2B service that needs to remind a busy audience of itself. 

With it, your retargeting audience isn’t necessarily your website visitors or active users. Do you have an e-book, content or a video that has performed well organically? Boost it and create custom audiences based on the time they watched a video. After collecting enough leads, divide them into low, medium and high engagement groups direct specific retargeting campaigns on them. 

Creating such custom segments will help you avoid too much competition, so your ad cost will become cheaper.



Still not getting the results you want?
5. Try organic Traffic
Organic Traffic sources usually require more attention and revert attitude than paid ones. But you should also take into account that organic traffic works for the long term and gives your website or landing page longevity. It can bring you the whole bunch of quality leads for years to come. Here are four most popular organic traffic sources to improve your funnel conversions.

 	
Social media;


Do you know that in 2019 people spent over 144 minutes on social media? Why loose this lucrative opportunity to show your offer to your target audience? And we're not talking about paid ads now. Being proactive on social media can help you grow your traffic in x10 times. Share some useful information related to your offer and people's needs, initiate talks in relevant communities and good luck.


 	
Content;


Blog or guest posting are one of the easiest ways to get relevant leads to your website. Offer your product review or write a short valuable article to well-indexed blogs and websites. By the way, there are must be a myriad of websites in your niche that are happy to publish an article about your product and get some fee from a sale. Just Google it!

 	
Referral; 


Start a simple referral program and ask your most loyal customers to refer you to their friends and colleagues for a particular bonus. It can be money, custom awards or any other bonus. Moreover, you can track the performance of your referral right in RedTrack with the help of Partnership Portal. 

&nbsp;



&nbsp;

 	Blog and Forum Comments.


Forums are unfairly undervalued organic traffic sources. Here you can encourage two-way communication between you and your potential audiences by providing value with your expert comments or encouraging discussions. Gaming and e-commerce forums are considered to be one of the most active communities in today's world. If you are a forum user, you know that the questions here may repeat from time to time. Create several scripts to most frequently ask questions to save your time and not lose touch with your audience.
Conclusion

As you see, all ad costs cutting activities are based on data analysis. To get a high ROI you need to test a million hypothesis to find the ones that truly work, whether it will be retargeting, affiliate websites placements or all at once. Is there a way to make it faster and in a more effective way? Basically, that's what ad trackers do. Now matter what strategy or tactic you use to promote your offers, it will monitor and analyze all the incoming information about your performance and provide your team with actionable about your ad campaigns.

7135,Guest Post: Basic Link Building Tips for Affiliate Marketing,"Link building is just one of the numerous ways of website promotion. Despite the fact this advancing method is not new, it is still efficient, and basic link building tips are not so difficult to implement. In this article, we are going to share the ways of how to make your affiliate website more reliable for PageRank as well as your customers with the help of a competent link building strategy.
Make the First Bet on Guest Posting
Probably, guest posting is a link building strategy that will never become outdated. What is more, your backlink is just one of the benefits of this way of promotion. The fact that you can reach even more interested customers is much more pleasant for business owners.


Develop Relationships With Influencers
Influencer marketing is an indispensable part of affiliate website promotion in 2020 and beyond. To utilize it effectively, you should develop your relations with influencers constantly and always motivate them to talk about you, post and share your links, test your products and services, and create even more engaging content on their behalf.
Boost Backlinks Generation With Social Media Contests
Here is one more idea to kill a lot of birds with one stone. Think about launching a social media contest and ask the participants to share the link to your website on their blogs. What is more, it shouldn’t be the only requirement. You may also ask them to register on your website, tag a friend, and start to follow your Insta profile, for example.


However, you shouldn’t set a lot of complicated requirements for people to enter the contest - or you have to offer an expensive prize in advance. As a rule, users would be ready to happily put a lot of effort into fulfilling all the requirements provided they see a real chance of winning, for instance, an iPhone. However, if you are not ready to pony up hundreds of dollars, you should not demand much from your subscribers; a link sharing sounds like just compensation for a chance of winning, say, a discount coupon.
Produce and Share Engaging Content
This point doesn’t need a long explanation. The more interesting and engaging your content is, the more users will be willing to share your link in their blogs and on social media profiles, thereby, boosting your backlink base organically. Hint! Make the highest bet on video since this is the type of content that gets the highest numbers of shares, likes, and comments. And this will be an effective move for your affiliate sales as well.
Have an Affiliate Disclosure Section
You can rationally argue - what is the relationship between the affiliate disclosure statement and your backlinks? Well, rest assured that some kind of connection still exists. Modern customers are really well-versed in the ways of how online business operates. That is why they are becoming more and more careful in choosing the places to make purchases and the ads to trust. So, your affiliate disclosure statement is yet another way to provide transparency and strengthen the trust between you and your audience. The feeling of trust provokes the desire not only to buy but also to share and recommend. Invest in trust - this is the best strategy to get a lot of organic backlinks placed by your customers - just because they want to do it.
Compete With Other Affiliates on Equal Terms
This strategy is quite simple but really worthwhile. The only thing you need to do is to find out what websites your competitors use to publish their links and get in touch with these platforms. If these platforms are promoting backlinks of your competitors (and their content respectively), there are all reasons to believe that they will allow you to place some of your links as well.
Be Active on Forums

7151,Referral program Part 2: Common mistakes and questions,"During COVID-19 building strong customer engagement has become more important than acquisition. A happy client is a paying client. Moreover, your loyal customer base can become a great source of organic lead generation. The power of recommendation is much bigger than the power of ads. Numbers show that referred clients typically have 16 % higher LTV and 18 % less churn than those that were acquired by other methods. So, why not to try?

Unfortunately, just saying your customers about your referral program ideas often isn’t enough. That’s why building a referral program requires a truly personalized approach. Do you want to know how to avoid mistakes at the very beginning?

First, you may find our previous blog post useful: Referral Program Part 1: 5 strategies that will help you earn money by referral link.

We also discussed how our clients use RedTrack to attract and engage their referrals. In this second part, we’d like to share our observations about the TOP 3 most common mistakes beginners make while building and promoting their referral programs. 

Ready? Let’s go!

Mistake #1. Making your Referral Program ideas too hard to understand
This applies to both the mechanics and messages you sent to referrals. They both should be simple and intuitive. Make sure that your referral signup is frictionless and the access to the offers is barrier-free. If you see that something goes wrong, help your referrals to find the right way and provide them with everything they might find useful while promoting your products or services.

This can be documentation, blog posts, presentations, creatives, and even text scripts. We use this strategy at RedTrack ourselves. Want to see how?

First, we enhanced our core ad tracking product with special features to provide our clients with a seamless user experience of managing and tracking their referrals. Both the referral program's owners and users have different workspaces and feature sets.

If you're the owner of a referral/affiliate program, you can add an unlimited number of offers, set available traffic sources, track and manage your referrals all in one place. Here's how it looks like.

 	
Create a Campaign with the right Traffic Source and go to 'Details for Publishers' Tab

&nbsp;

&nbsp;



2. Write down your Referral Offer Description and finish your settings
&nbsp;


3. Click on the Publisher Panel Tab, add your Referrals, and generate special links for them
If you want to see how your offer will be seen by your Publisher, click on the Login as a Publisher button. Here's what we got:



&nbsp;

4. Track your Referrals performance all at once

The other workspace is designed specifically for publishers and is called the Pub Panel. Here Referrals might see the available offers, go deep into details of your offer 9 traffic sources/GEO restrictions/creatives).



How to make these separate workspaces work together?

1. Gather your referral contacts. You may find new audience by creating a special landing page or take emails from your user base.
2. Enter their contact details into RedTrack;
3. Enable the right offers to the right people;
4. Send them the activation URL.

All set! Now let them earn by referral link

Sounds easy, isn't it? But let's go through the most typical mistakes marketers often make.
Mistake #2. You promote what you think your customers would like
It's important to ensure that your rewards are worth your client's effort. If your customers need to make a lot of effort to find new users for your product, he or she will require a corresponding reward. Too small or irrelevant ones will demotivate customers from going into your referral program.

And yes, don't forget about your competitors and companies that target the same audience. While working on awards, our team used all of the above-mentioned methods and also provided in-depth customer satisfaction research. By the way, how do you find our awards? If you find anything interesting, please, sign up for our Referral Program and earn by referral link.

&nbsp;
Mistake #3. Don't put enough efforts into your Referral Program Promotion
1. Not enough promo channels
It may sound like a platitude, but today a lot of referral program ideas fail simply because customers don’t know about it. Creating a separate tab on your website isn't enough. Don’t be afraid to reach a new audience that never worked with your product before. Reaching out to as many people as possible is a crucial factor that will determine the success of your referral program. The more people know about your initiative, the more chances you'll be able to acquire new customers that will drive more sales. Treat it as a separate campaign and use several traffic sources for its promotion. Yes, increasing referral traffic is twice as harder if you're a small brand of a beginner,  but it's absolutely possible.

Organic traffic sources:

 	Guest posting on Industry Blogs;
 	Cross-promo activities with companies/ product with the same audience;
 	Commenting on forums and blogs;
 	Social Networks activities;
 	Build trust on thematic forums;
 	Add information about referral program to your online signatures and bio where it's relevant;
 	Adding Share Button on your website and post-purchase messages;
 	Insert it into the users' interface.

Paid traffic sources:

 	Social media Ads;
 	Search Ads;
 	Retargeting;
 	Video Promotion.

We won't lie. There’s no guarantee that all of them will work. To get a better understanding of what works and what's not, you may try  RedTrack to track the efficiency of your multiple traffic sources using just one tracking link. 

&nbsp;
2. Bad CTAs
The CTA color or its name can make a serious change in your funnels metrics. If your CTA is buried on your website or resting somewhere in the website footer, there is much less opportunity for a customer to interact with it. Plus, make sure you have a clear call-to-action in each of your communication form that directs the audience to the right destination. One of the easiest ways to make your CTA stand out is to make it contrast with the surroundings.

Here are some examples of bad and good CTAs:

&nbsp;

3. Wrong incentives
Do you know what really motivates your customers? More money? Social proof? Networking with your other customers? One of the biggest mistakes is that companies are usually trying to save their resources by offering lackluster incentives to their clients. Here we're not talking about bonuses or awards. Here we're talking about the users making a choice to participate or not into your initiative. Applying specific incentives to your offers and add some kind of urgency. Customers are usually much more likely to respond to exclusive offers than an ordinary promotion lacking inclusion and intrinsic value.
Conclusion
Selling Referral Program ideas that actually work requires a lot of effort. Before going into it we recommend exploring how other programs work and try to promote several of them to check how everything works from a referral's side. If you don't know which program to choose for a start, try RedTrack ad tracker.  Receive 15% commission for each referral deal and enjoy custom rewards.",9/22/2020,https://redtrack.io/blog/referral-program-mistakes/,Uncategorized
7202,What’s Marketing Attribution? A guide boost your Ad performance,"The media-buying world has changed, they say. And that’s true. The old concept of using industry best practices doesn’t seem to be so effective today. It has evolved into endless experiments with traffic sources, offers, creatives, and ad placements. As ways of reaching and converting users became more complicated, the problem of marketing attribution model choice and usage became more and more relevant. Why?

Marketing attribution helps make media-buying world simpler and easier to digest. It allows to see the real picture of what’s going on with your media-buying campaigns and analyze the results to make better investment decisions. Sounds a little bit complicated, doesn't it? No worries, in this blog post, we’ll explain everything in detail. Continue reading if you want to learn:

 	What’s marketing attribution;
 	What types of marketing attribution exist on the market;
 	How to use it to boost your ad performance.

Ready? Then, let's go in the order.
What is marketing attribution?
This mysterious term is basically the practice of evaluating the the steps your users make on their path to conversion for ROAS calculation. The main goal of attribution is to determine which factor, event or step in your sales funnel had the greatest impact on users conversion. 

&nbsp;



&nbsp;

The main problem here is that conversions are treated differently by different tracking services. Some may attribute the conversion to the channel which the user interacted first. Others, on the contrary, will attribute it to the last step the users made before conversion happened or evenly distribute the credit across all the touchpoint inside conversion path .

Currently, there are 6 most popular attribution models available on the market.

Let’s consider them all in detail.
What types of attribution models exist on the market?
First, you should know that there's no perfect attribution model type in this world. Each model has its own pros and cons and all we have to do is  just deal with it. The two most popular ones are the first and last-click attribution models. Let's take a closer look at them.



 	
First Interaction (first-click) model;


In the First Interaction attribution model, the conversion is attributed to the first touchpoint your user pass through when started interacting with your funnel. It can be anything from your Facebook Ads banner, the link in directories or just a direct search in Google. No matter how difficult or long the user’s path was further, this first touchpoint would receive 100% of the credit for the conversion/sale.

 	
Last Interaction (last-click) model;


Last Interaction attribution model is pretty similar to the first one. The only difference is that in this case the conversion credit will receive the last channel the user interacted with before conversion happened.

For example, a user finds your blog post via Google search. Three days later he clicks on your Facebook Retargeting Ads. A day later he visits your landing page directly as now he’s ready to make a purchase. With the last-click attribution model, the direct traffic touchpoint will be considered as the one that lead to a conversion.



As you see, both of these models have their own pros and cons. At the same time, both of them can be a good fit for you if you have a short buying cycle or focus on the top-of-the-funnel customers. Using them together will help you understand:

 	which of your channels is the strongest when it comes to attracting qualified lead;
 	what channel is the most effective when it comes to converting your user into lead or a customer.

Is there a way to combine both of this models for better understanding of your ad performance?
 Absolutely. That’s what we do in RedTrack. By default, the conversions are recorded according to the last click attribution model. Respectively, all your metrics in the Reporting Portal section are calculated in accordance to this. But you can easily switch to the first click attribution models in your Profile section.

Note: This feature is available for Pro customers and above.



Besides, in your Logs-&gt; Conversions section you’ll have First Click and the Conversion time columns which basically stay for the first-and-the last clicks attribution models. This information will help you understand the performance of your campaign on a deeper level and make better decisions.

Read: -&gt; How to Skyrocket your business with RedTrack Data Reports
What are the other attribution models?
There are only four left to make out:

 	
Last Non-Direct Click;


As the name suggests, in this case, all direct traffic is ignored, and 100% of the conversion credit is given to the last non-direct channel the customer interacted with before he made he made the target action. If the last click was ‘direct’, the system will look back at the user's journey to attribute the conversion to any prior ‘non-direct clicks’. 

Let's look at an example:

A user leaves contact in the form on the website and you start an email campaign. The user finds your offer interesting, clicks on CTA, spend some time on your landing page, but still doesn't buy anything. In two days he makes a direct search of your website and buys a product.

In this case the conversion will be attributed to your Email campaign.

 	
Linear;`


Within this attribution model, all the touchpoint along your sales funnel will share equal credit for the conversion. In our case of 4 touchpoint, each of them will recieve 25% credit.

Easy!

&nbsp;



 	
Time-Decay;


This model gives the most credit to the touchpoint the user came across at the closest time to the conversion. In many ways this model is similar to the last-click one. The only difference is that it focuses on time not on the action itself.

 	
Position-Based.


In this case, 40% of conversion credit goes to the first and last events, and 20% of credit that is remained is distributed evenly to the middle events. 

&nbsp;





As you see, Linear, Time decay, and Position-based models break up the conversion event across all the touchpoint you created. Here's an example that demonstrated the difference between different attribution models working mechanisms. Let's assume your user should come across Facebook, Google Organic, Email, and Direct channels:

&nbsp;


How can attribution modeling help you boost your Ad performance?
According to iProspect, 
 Attribution implementation can result into 15 – 35 percent gain in media- buying efficiency and ROI boost.
What are the reasons? There're 4 of them:

 	Accurate Revenue Attribution. Your ROAS, Costs and other metrics will differ depending on your attribution model choice. That's why its important to try several use different attribution models to understand which touchpoints and hypothesis have the better ROI in each case.


 	Understand your user better: Marketing attribution shows you which of your campaigns/touchpoints have the greatest response from your users and helps you create effective buyer personas and set up audience targeting.&nbsp;

Statistically, more than 90% of website visitors are not converted to customers when they first visit website. More than a half leaves it within first 15 seconds. They use more and more third party information sources before making a purchase. Marketing attribution will help you understand in which touchpoint you should invest more to get a better ROI.
 
 	Understand The Value of The Customer: Marketing attribution model will help you understand how your customers LTV influence each of your sales funnel touchpoint and help determine campaign spend across your acquisition/retention programs.

Conclusion
Marketing attribution is the only way to get a clear look at your multi-channel marketing campaigns and complicated sales funnels efficiency. It provides you insights on how your users make decisions, who's your audience and what are the most efficient touchpoint that you work on. As there're no perfect attribution model in the world today, we implemented two types of attribution models in RedTrack (the first-and-the last click ones) so you can get better understanding of how good your hypothesis are and make better decisions.

7282,How to prepare for a holiday season in 2020: media-buyers kit,"The holiday season is coming closer. The whole world is waiting for sales, special deals, and cozy home photos with a delicious roasted turkey on a plate. A lot of media-buyers have already accustomed to slightly reduced CPCs caused by COVID-19. However, with the holiday season price per click typically goes up, especially in e-commerce, nutra, and other verticals related to popular consumer products. Want to know how to boost your sales during this profitable season? Here are the 5 main lessons we've learned from our customers.
Why 2020 Holiday Season is special
In 2019 National Research Found has calculated that retail sales in November and December can account for nearly 1/3 of annual sales. In 2020 Due to COVID-19, most shoppers will prefer to purchase their favorite goods online. Criteo says that 64% of consumers still miss going to physical stores, while 88% are pretty sure they will do their annual shopping routine via smartphones and laptops. These stats can tell us about three main trends of this holiday season: consumer demand growth, increased competition, higher error's price.

The following holiday media-buying tips will help you beat your competitors and boost your sales with no big losses:

 	Starting early. Literally now;
 	Learn from your past experience;
 	Experiment with multiple ad placements, channels, and budgets;
 	Think about the Refer-a-friend program or Loyalty Rewards;
 	Don't play with false urgency. Create a real reason to buy.


1. Start your media-buying activities earlier


Prosper Insights and Analytics state that 89% of consumers research products online before buying. In the holiday season, they start making a shopping list and pre-holiday research in October already. In some cases - at the end of September. Most of their purchases, however, still occur in November. Given all this, the best thing you can do now: 

 	analyze your consumers' preferences;
 	start testing your campaigns now;
 	invest in engagement with your target audience. Engaged users are more likely to convert into buyers. Don't be afraid of being too early. Now is the time. If not you, it will be your competitors that will grasp your audience's attention.


2. Learn from past experience
The holiday season lasts 3 months a year. It's totally okay if you don't know where to start. If you're an experienced media-buyer, a good way to start will be analyzing the performance of your previous campaigns during this time. Yes, the time has changed and your 2019 strategies might not work today. But going back will help you find insights, create a framework, and avoid mistakes you made back then. If you have any issues with your ads analytics tools, you can always migrate your data from multiple traffic sources to RedTrack and analyze it with the help of drill-down reports. 30+ metrics are all at your disposal. Here you can: 

 	customize your entire dashboard. Do whatever you'd like to do: add, hide all the available columns and metrics;
 	create special reports based on one or several subIDs (tokens). Choose country, device type, detailed users' data, and others;
 	compare the ad data from several time periods;
 	create templates to save your time in the future;
 	export it all to CSV file;
 	share it with your team with the help of a multi-access feature.

 	Creatives they make
 	Their strategy effectiveness

&nbsp;
3. Experiment with multiple ad placements, channels, and creatives
Novice media-buyers are often afraid of competition from large brands and more experienced colleagues. Science says that today even the most conservative consumers are more open to new products, brands, and stores. Many of them have changed their consumer habits during the lockdown and are more likely to buy from websites they haven't known before. During the lockdown:

 	33% found small merchants they didn't previously know about and purchased from them;
 	83% said they’re likely to keep purchasing from the new stores they discovered.

So, everything is in your hands now!

There's no proven recipe that will help you beat the competition during this time.

&nbsp;
The best strategy that always works is experimenting!
&nbsp;

Remember that holiday planning isn't limited to landing pages, email layouts, and creatives look. Before finding the fit, you'll have to spend a certain part of your ad budget on failures. It's really hard to predict which channel or placement will be the most profitable for you.

To minimize the loss, keep your data in one place, and constantly check its performance. So, when you see that something goes wrong with your holiday campaigns, you can always add the enhancements and test another channel. Be careful when buying traffic from Google and Facebook. They don't allow redirects, so you have to be careful. In RedTrack you can track the traffic coming from these traffic sources separately with the help of a no-redirect script. 

It will neatly place your stats in reports and provide all the updates in real-time. If you'd like to learn more about media-buying on Facebook &amp; Google and keeping your account safe, watch our latest Product Stream.



&nbsp;
4. Think about the Refer-a-friend program or Loyalty Reward
Referral programs have a lot of advantages. But the main one is the cost per acquisition reduction. There are three main time intervals to offer your customers refer your product or service to their friends, colleagues, or social media friends : 

 	before purchase to stimulate them to convert;
 	right after purchase;
 	the moment they received the benefit from the purchase.

By offering both pre-purchase and post-purchase referrals, you’re giving users more opportunities to accept the offer. How to figure out which strategy will suit best to your referral program? Again, Test! Remind your customers about your referral program several times,  analyze the results, and determine the time when the response is better. To track your customers' involvement in your initiative, you can use RedTrack and its Publisher Panel. Here you can add an unlimited number of offers, set the needed traffic sources (if you want your customer to share it on Facebook, for example), and track it all in one place.

&nbsp;




5. Don't play with false urgency. Create a real reason to buy.
Urgency is one of the most popular tactics media-buyers use to convert their leads into customers at this time of year. The problem is that everyone does it. Some brands do it so often that customers don't react to urgency incentives at all.

A sense of urgency works great in four main cases.

 	Work with a brand that doesn't hold any sales or does it very rarely throughout the year;
 	Promote premium brands;
 	Donate a percentage of profit to the charity or support non-profit organizations;
 	Use it as a last-minute impulse for the shoppers you've already established a connection.

In other cases, you need to think out of the box. Don't devalue the brand you work with and make it cheaper in your customers' eyes. Find this line between unmethodical discounting and building relationships with customers.
Conclusion
The demand growth along with increased competition makes the holiday season an exciting and challenging time for all media-buyers. To position your offer above others, you need to apply both: a research-based data-driven approach paired with creativity. Don't be afraid to apply tactics you never used before: start among the first,  build relationships with your customers, create a refer-a-friend program, experiment with new traffic sources, and reconsider your attitude standard ways of attracting and engaging new customers. If done right, the results won't keep you long.

7312,[Webinar] How to Maximize your Profits with Betting and App Installs,"2020 is a challenging year for all media-buyers: COVID, borders closure, economic recession. But no worries. Everything is not so bad. It's 2 months left to reach this year's goals and make up the leeway. How?

Together with Adcash — a global self-serve advertising platform for media buyers, we held the webinar where we shared tips on how to succeed in affiliate marketing and skyrocket your profit with betting offers and app installs.

Missed the webinar? Check our blog post. Here're the most important point.


Why Betting and App Installs?
They are two verticals that return to their normal state faster than others. Let's have a deeper look into both of them. 
App Installs

App installs verticals went a little bit down in summer. And there's nothing surprising in it. A lot of small startups were closed, while a lot of grown-up businesses were forced to change their business model for a while. Today we can say that everything returns to its place. Especially, with the Android apps. We see a huge long-term interest in VPN offers, for example. Why? People are vulnerable on the internet. The easiest way to maintain security for them is to use a VPN. In this way, they can not only hide your actions from prying eyes but unlock some content, website, and get access to the right information.


Betting

During COVID-19 all sports events were canceled and the industry lost a lot of money. But do you see what's happening now? All this interest and excitement around UFC fights? Do you see how many people are watching the European Football League? Here's how many campaigns were run last month:

Sports Betting campaigns run in August: 554. Countries: 99
Sports Betting campaigns run in September: 634. Countries: 103 

Don't miss the opportunity:) 



&nbsp;
Top 10 Tips to run App Installs and Betting Offers
1. Do not bet on one campaign only. Do split tests, e.g. one campaign that targets everything with an average bid and one that has some advanced features applied ( e.g. Keyword Targeting, Website Targeting) with a higher bid.  

2. Delete old versions' reviews from your app's page. There might be bugs mentioning, or just negative emotional bots comments that you don't want your new uses to read.

3. Always customize your landing page for the event. Make sure there's no hard copyright infringement on it and it's written in the language of your target audience. 

4. Encourage your audience to write comments on your app's page. Create a community and find insights.

5. Did you know that bots can make up 70% of your traffic? Avoid fake conversions with anti-fraud and bot detection solutions and use filtering options to blacklist IPs.

6. Make sure your bids are competitive enough. Be in touch with your advertiser manager or follow the platform suggestions.

7. Make data-informed decisions. No count, your guts may be always right. Compare your data in different period frames to find the most effective tactics and attribute your conversions and revenue in the right way. 

8. Use automation to avoid mistakes and spend your time on things that matter.

9. When advertising mobile offers, try to test multiple sources with the same approach. Sometimes, just switching the source can yield great results.

10. Don't spend your budget all at once. Make sure you spread it throughout the day.

It actually depends on the country and the particular offer settings. In Adcash, among the top-performing offers, I'd name — apps, browsers gaming, dating (both mobile and web), casinos.
— Evgeniy | A

Q3: How to setup and farm FB to run ads, test new offers, and landers?
There're no rules actually here. Just one thing to remember: Facebook hates redirects, so the best advice will be to use a landing page and use no-redirect tracking methods. Use drill-down ads reports data to see what's working and what's not and stop unprofitable campaigns.
— Vanda | RedTrack.

Q4: When should I run an offer with a landing page and when direct linking? 
It's always a matter of fraud here. If you've already experienced some fraud on your offer before, pre-lander will be some kind of a guarantee you'll have less fraud.  Pre-lander is an additional option to explain to your users the value of your offer, so they will come to your landing page prepared. — Evgeniy | Adcash
Q4: Are sweepstakes good?
If we are talking about market, yes, this is a pretty good niche. But we should also take in mind that there are a lot of sweepstakes offers and you can promote them in many different ways. A lot of people just copy and paste their landing pages and hope for the best. In most cases they don't get what they want. Those who apply personalized approach, have better ROI and are ore satisfied with this vertical.

7363,Ad Trackers as a companionship of MyLead,"This article was submitted by MyLead, a global affiliate network with over 100 thousand publishers from all over the world. MyLead offers over 2000 campaigns from over a dozen different categories. To see MyLead’s campaigns click here.

The role of ad tracking should be quite clear and known to all of you. It helps you to track effectiveness and maximize your performance when it comes to marketing. Especially, affiliate marketing. 
Who needs an ad tracker?
Ad trackers, like RedTrack, are a great solution for novice publishers. Later, however, the beginner publisher changes into a more advanced one. They will run several websites, send mailings, and work with the help of social media networks. Their activities will become more and more complicated and require professional tools, like ad trackers.

Ad tracking is therefore a tool for both advanced and starting MyLead publishers that will synchronize conversion reports with external analytical systems. The data provided by RedTrack is used to analyze user’s behavior and may have a significant impact on the effectiveness of your marketing activities. It’s a tool that is sometimes overlooked when talking about individual marketing strategies, but extremely popular within bigger online businesses. 


Focus on your goals and reach them
If you aspire to be a successful publisher, you probably want to achieve at least 4 of these things that are offered by ad tracking platforms:

 	learning all about the performance of your work,
 	managing all campaigns in one place,
 	using automation to avoid time-consuming and unnecessary extra work,
 	targeting your ads to make them more effective,
 	testing campaigns for best results,
 	receiving full support,
 	gaining access to your campaigns, also on mobile devices.

Ad Trackers for publishers
As a MyLead publisher, you can promote your chosen products or services in all sorts of ways. Let’s say you own a blog, where you recommend a given product. The most frequently chosen method is CPS - cost per sale, which is a commission received for each completed transaction, that is made thanks to your personalized, affiliate link. 

To see MyLead’s CPS campaigns, click here:



In this case, an ad tracking platform will be suitable for you if you:

 	want to understand your users better,
 	are an advanced publisher, who is always looking forward to improving your performance,
 	promote MyLead’s affiliate programs in many channels (Youtube, Twitter, Blog, Facebook Ads, Google AdWords, PPC advertising),
 	want to collect statistics in your own analytical system.


Why is it important to track your ads when you’re a publisher?


The publisher’s success in affiliation goes hand in hand with the ability to analyze the results of marketing activities. If you have ambitions and want to become a professional marketer, you need to master the data in which your money is invested.

In this case, ad trackers are game-changers.
What useful information will ad tracking provide?

 	IP from which conversions were generated, 
 	the exact address of the page from which the user came to the advertiser's website, 
 	the user came to the advertiser's website,
 	value of the purchase made by the user,
 	commission value,
 	the time elapsed from clicking on the affiliate link to converting,
 	conversion status

And other information thanks to which you will learn more about the behavior of your users that allow you to increase your profits from affiliate marketing.

Another very important option is the ability to add your own parameters for conversion. This is essential for advanced MyLead publishers. These parameters can act as channels and serve to distinguish between predetermined sources. The most important difference, however, is that the parameters can be dynamically assigned by a foreign system.

Another feature of any professional affiliate system is the MyLead publisher’s tracking code. The publisher’s tracking code enables the integration of the affiliate system with the publisher's system. The publisher can add postbacks or pixels from their system. As a result, information about conversions will be transferred to his own system in real-time. The transmitted data may contain all information about the conversion. Depending on the publisher’s needs, it may be, for example:

 	the name of the campaign, 
 	channel, 
 	user’s IP.

It would help you in targeting your potential audience, etc.
Ad Tracking - opportunities that are often overlooked
Integration testing is one of the natural activities for both publishers, advertisers, and Mylead as an affiliate network itself. Tracking testing is carried out, among others when starting a new affiliate program via the network, or when a new publisher joins. It is a necessary activity for all parties involved, but also sometimes problematic. If the tests are not successful, the options to analyze the logs of a given event turn out to be irreplaceable. With such capabilities, the network is able to quickly locate the place where the problem occurs and have errors fixed.


Attribute all conversion events
Improve conversion rates by having full transparency into when a conversion happens for each and every customer. Optimize different conversion points and funnel stages to drive the highest return on ad spend.
Collaborate &amp; share your improved results
Connect your team within one platform, and save hours with shared views and reports for peers, partners, and customers. Set access right to different sections of the account and show only the data you want to share.
Analyze &amp; optimize real-time
Get accurate data for each impression, click, and conversion in real-time. Save hours of manual work and turn insights into actions with campaign automation rules and alerts.

RedTrack provides an ad tracking and conversions attribution platform for publishers from MyLead. An all-in-one ad tracker like this will help you improve the performance of your affiliate campaigns and find insights to improve your ROI.
Why do ad trackers work so well with affiliate marketing?
The tracking system, like RedTrack, is created for affiliate marketers to give them the opportunity to promote MyLead’s campaigns in full. Not only they allow you to create affiliate links and calculate commission, but also offer much more advanced options. This is important for both the MyLead publishers and advertisers.



Try out combining your affiliate marketing skills from MyLead, with ad tracking to make sure your performance is as good as possible and your earnings are as high as possible.

In order for an affiliate network like MyLead, to function, it must be able to determine where a given conversion is coming from (clicks, leads, sales, etc.) On this basis, it determines the effectiveness of a given publisher and conducts settlements with them.

7386,RedTrack enables extra revenue stream for the leading Belarusian media TUT.BY,"Taking into account the importance many companies place on online advertising, why is it still such a large rate of digital media spend – 40-60% – tracked ineffectively? After an organization decides to switch to a new strategy or business model, it’s always a tipping point to structure efficiency tracking and reporting. TUT.BY knew that from the very beginning, and that is where their CPA tracking journey with RedTrack starts.

About TUT.BY
TUT.BY is an independent media and service internet portal, one of the 5 most popular websites in Belarus. Besides, it’s the leading and most popular news web portal in the country. TUT.BY headquarters in Minsk with over 250 employees. In 2020, the website is read by 69% of Belarusian internet users with over 24 mln unique monthly visitors.
Historically, TUT.BY monetized its traffic, offering advertisers direct placements for fixed price only. However, they noticed that the overall advertising market start substantially moving towards the CPA monetization model. It turns out to be more efficient, and at the same time – more technologically advanced. 

Opportunity:
Switch from traditional advertising to CPA model
&nbsp;

“There were two big reasons, why we decided to restructure our business model in order to find additional revenue streams:
1. there was a lot of residual traffic, which would be best to monetize using the CPA model*.
2. an increasing number of advertisers requested placement at the CPA model and refused to work with TUT.BY under the traditional direct placement model (editor: fixed price 

for ad unit)”.


&nbsp;
Ilya Krasnogir 
Digital Marketer, TUT.BY
&nbsp;
CPA, Cost-per-Action, is an online advertising payment model where the advertiser pays only for a specified action. A customer agrees with an advertiser for himself what actions to pay for.

The CPA model has several advantages for every party involved.


 	The customer doesn’t pay for each impression, i.e. every time their banner or link was shown to a web visitor, even if they don’t click on it. Thus a customer is more confident in receiving returns from the budget invested in the advertising.
 	The website owner is interested in attracting more quality traffic. The more targeted actions will be committed on his site, the more money he will earn. Besides, with the CPA model, you open the doors to a bigger market of advertisers, as most of them prefer this payment model nowadays.

TUT.BY team understood that they want to realize the full potential for their traffic monetization. So, in addition to the fixed payment model, they decided to offer the advertisers an opportunity of working with a CPA model. The next stage for the company was to find needed tools and expertise to develop internal capabilities.


Challenge:
Why TUT.BY started looking for an ad tracker?
TUT.BY tried working with affiliate networks under the CPA model using their internal tracking systems. This partially improved monetization of residual traffic. However, work with local clients under the CPA model still represented significant revenue potential.   
TUT.BY understood that to take full advantage of the opportunity, they need to find a 3rd party tracking tool that will help them to consolidate all the data in one place and provide impartial analytics to both TUT.BY team and the advertisers. After the research of available ad tracking solutions on the market, they reached several companies including RedTrack.


“RedTrack offered a more comprehensive system that could do everything we were looking for but without overwhelming. Besides RedTrack’s value for money proposition was definitely a win. But in addition to this, RedTrack also won the deal with its stellar customer support, helping TUT.BY to onboard the new system smoothly and save a lot of time with setting things up”.
Ilya Krasnogir 
Digital Marketer, TUT.BY

TUT.BY favorite RedTrack features:


 	precise tracking without 3rd party cookies. RedTrack offers 1st party cookies technology, which is important to have everything tracked correctly and gives confidence that the operations will not collapse when 3rd party cookies technology will be abandoned by all browsers.
 	multi-dimensional reports. With real-time reporting, a user gets a comprehensive picture of every ad campaign's efficiency outcomes. Besides, it saves time on data consolidation from multiple advertisers’ campaigns.
 	ease of tracking links set-up.
 	shared reports with advertisers. RedTrack helps their customers and advertisers to enjoy full transparency of their budget allocation and outcomes.

Now, after 7 months of working with RedTrack TYT.BY emphasizes speed, convenience, and transparency of the service:


“What I really like about RedTrack is how quick and easy it is to create new campaigns. We tell the client to add GTM to the site and give us access, then the RedTrack team helps us to finish the setup. This saves a lot of time and helps to launch campaigns quickly. But most importantly, I always confident that everything works as it is supposed to.”
Ilya Krasnogir 
Digital Marketer, TUT.BY

Results
As a result, RedTrack helped TUT.BY to generate additional advertising revenues by improving the monetization of residual traffic and attracting new clients who wish to work under the CPA model.
Now TUT.BY can work with their clients directly without intermediaries – partner networks. RedTrack allows TUT.BY to design and operationally execute unique campaign set-ups satisfying all possible client demand. Finally, RedTrack creates confidence that all the traffic will be tracked and no revenues will be lost.

7403,Top 5 Tips To Consider When Looking For The Best Affiliate Network,"In recent years there are a bunch of affiliate networks that all compete against each other for the #1 spot on the market! Finding the right one can be difficult, but with these simple 5 tips, you should be able to find the best affiliate network for you!
Tip #1. Who Is Your Target
The choice of networks is enormous and you have to start narrowing it down. First of all, you should focus on who you will be targeting. If you are into specific niches (or verticals), try finding affiliate networks that focus on said niches. If you don’t know how your niche would perform on a network, feel free to ask them! It is in their interest to give you as much info as possible. 


Tip #2. Check For Fees Or Hidden Costs 
Affiliate marketing is performance-based, so the better you do the more money you make for the network and yourself. Some networks are greedy so they also ask for a fee or monthly payments that you need to make in order to work with them. This not only shows that they don’t believe in your skills, but it is also a scummy thing to do. Try searching for networks that treat you right and actually trust you, it will make a huge difference!
Tip #3. Don’t Avoid Competition
Beginners often get scared of networks that are used by their competitors, but this shouldn’t be the case. If all of your competitors are running on a network, then that network is probably doing something right. Just make sure to check how successful their efforts with the network truly are. 

The increased number of competitors means that there will also be an influx of relevant and established publishers. 
Tip #4. Tracking
For most people, basic tracking and reporting are more than enough. But some merchants require a more robust tracking solution that not all affiliate networks can provide. Sometimes these better tracking features cost extra so research the solution that is right for you. 

Looking for a feature-rich ad tracking solution with 160+ turnkey integrations with top affiliate and advertising networks? Register for a 14-day free trial with RedTrack or request a demo call with our specialists. 
Tip #5. Support and Further Info
Find affiliate networks that offer you full support with any problem you might have. If you have constant issues and the network doesn’t care at all, that is a good sign that you should avoid working with them. 

Check if they are a black box (they don’t share info about traffic origins, publishers, and a lot of other things). If yes, try finding a network that is more open and transparent about their operation. 
Try finding out as much as you can before signing up with a Network.

 	Is it an established or completely new network?
 	Do people have issues with it?
 	How many affiliates use it?
 	Where is the company located?

All of this will help you form a better opinion about how trustworthy the network actually is. 

There are a bunch of criteria that you can narrow your search down. You should spend a considerable amount of time looking through the available choices. Pick the right one the first time and things will be much easier. 

Experts have additional tips that they might share with beginners. One of these experts,  iAmAttila had this to add to our article:
""The most important thing when choosing an affiliate network is to work with an established one with a good history in the industry. You don't want to get ripped off by not getting paid. The best CPA network always offers payouts that meet your needs...""

7442,Pushground tips to optimize push ad campaigns during holidays,"With Q4 being the most significant time of the year for digital advertising, there is no better time to improve the optimization of your ad campaigns.  We reached out to our friends at Pushground and ask them to share their expertise on campaign optimization regarding push ads campaigns. Although this article is more focused on push ad campaigns, you can apply these tactics to other types of ad formats, including POP and native.
What are Push Ads?
Before we get started, let's quickly review - what are push ads? Since their arrival, push ads have become one of the hottest new advertising formats available. Push advertising uses notifications to directly deliver promotional content to a user’s device in the form of a push ad. This highly-engaging format climbed to the top because of its visibility, high engagement, and, most importantly, its exceptional performance.

Push Ads - the winning secret to your affiliate marketing strategy this Holiday season:

Push ads have dominated the affiliate and advertising industry because of their unmatched performance. The ad format's nature has given it many advantages over other ad formats like display and pop ads. The alert-style ad brings in much higher average CTRs and conversion rates because of its high visibility and discrete style. On top of all that, it’s the only ad type you have to subscribe to, leading to more engaged audiences. Affiliates using thoroughly optimized push campaigns during this holiday season are sure to make it big.

Push ads have made their way to the marketing culture since the users can no longer ignore them. The alert-styled ads capture the users’ attention more than anything else. The Smartinsights 2020 report shows that the average CTR for Google display ads is just 0.05%, whereas, according to Pushground’s ad trends report, the average CTR of push ads is about 0.58%. It goes to show the effectiveness of the trending format. 

Now let's get into the good stuff. 
How to optimize your Push Ad-Campaigns
Optimizing a campaign is pertinent to its success. It happens to be one of the most critical steps in running a successful push ad campaign or any digital marketing campaign for that matter. It is the process of analyzing your campaign results, refining your campaign to maximize your ROI. Optimization is essentially a trial and run process to find the best combination for your push ad campaigns. It can be applied to all the steps from i.e., even from bidding and source targeting to landing pages and ad creatives.

A lot of tools that we offer at RedTrack let you optimize, automate, and run your push ad-campaigns very effortlessly. Ever struggled with finding the best source of truth and detecting the winning combinations? Contact us, and we would assist you with the advanced ad tracking and conversion attribution software set-up.



 hbspt.cta.load(7519541, 'ef490f48-8ab0-4913-8668-57716f5d0600', {}); 

Let's dive into the process of how to optimize a successful push campaign.
1. Plan &amp; Gather Data
The most important thing is correctly setting up the campaigns because a well-structured strategy can help speed up the optimization process. So, proper planning and market analysis are necessary before a viable push ads campaign launch. A look into the recent trends and competitors’ practices can help you quickly find what's working, i.e. suitable vertical/niche + funnel combinations.

After the successful setup and launch of the campaign, start gathering the data from it. Optimization without sufficient data can be dangerous because you could make the wrong decisions based on inaccurate data. 

Ideally, it would be best if you wait until you have an ad spend equal to your payout before you start messing with anything. You can use the following as a guide:

−  Start bid optimization at 1x payout
−  Start your ad creative optimization at 1-2x payout
−  Start your laundering page optimization when conversion &gt; 10
−  Start narrowing your targeting and blacklists when ad spend (per target or feed) &gt;3x payout

It’s important to note here that this is meant as a guide and not a perfect formula. Finding a one size fits all solution is difficult since a general formula would rarely work the same for a $2 sweepstakes payout and a crypto campaign with $500.
2. Alter your Bid to the Desired Win Rate
Once you have planned and collected the data for your campaign, move to the second stage, i.e. optimize your bid to the desired win ratio.

A win rate is the % of the traffic that you can buy with your current bid. Your overall win rate is a great indication of how much you should be bidding. If you’re anything below a 30-40% win rate, you are likely missing the better quality traffic to the people bidding above you. If a bid is resulting in a win rate of above 70%, you might be overspending. There will be times when you want your win rate at that level but at the beginning of the optimization process is probably not one of those times.

Tips: Adjusting different bids for different supply IDs works well. Move over to your Campaign Stats Page, select your campaign, and then set the dimension as ""Supply ID"". It helps in figuring out the bid performance across all supplies. Regular checking is also necessary because of the volatile prices of push traffic.
3. Improve Your Creatives
Then comes the creative part. Ad Creatives are a significant part of the optimization process!

An intriguing title, a catchy description, and an appealing image make for a perfect ad. These are all essential test items. You can implement A/B testing to find the best performing creatives quickly. At Pushground, they allow you to a/b test up to 10 different creatives at a time as well as offering automated creative optimization making your best performing ads the ones being shown.
4. Optimize Your Landing Page
Landing pages are a must in your push ad campaign, and you got to be on top of your game in building a landing page. A properly designed and well-optimized landing page significantly increases the conversion rate.   

Some of the vital stats you can measure landing pages performance are:

 	 Conversion rate or conversion per click
 	 Bounce Rate
 	 Loading time 

If you’re not getting enough conversions or facing some other problems with the landing page, there are a lot of things you can do to optimize your landing page for maximum conversion. Properly optimizing your landing page might require you to use landing page builders for quickly testing different things to reach a suitable combination. Read our article and find the most popular landing page and funnel builders there.

Once you’re finished building the page, you can use in-depth analysis tools like crazyegg and smartlook to gain valuable insights into your landing pages' performance. The speed of your landing page has a massive impact on CR. Walmart found that conversion increased by 2% for every 1-sec faster loading times.  This is even truer for mobile sites. Gtmetrix and Google page speed insights are the tools that’ll help you reduce the loading time of your landing pages. Pre-landers are also recommended with landing pages as they help you optimize and find problem areas faster as well as giving a large boost to your CR.
5. Create Blacklist / Whitelist to Optimize the Supply of Traffic
You should start blacklisting resources and create whitelist data once you have sufficient information. Usually, it’s recommended to wait until you have spent around three times the payout for a supply. This will help you avoid over-optimization and missing out on potential opportunities.

You always want to start with a blacklist before you ever move to a whitelist to avoid missing out on potential opportunities.
Learn more: How to create a bot blacklist.

6. Optimize your Targeting Settings
You can further customize your campaign by playing with the targeting options.

Analyze the outcome from different device types, operating systems (OS), network types, and carriers through the campaign statistics tab. Notice the patterns in your CTR and conversions and make the necessary bid adjustments or pause entirely for the underperforming groups. For example, if you found that you got better mobile results rather than WIFI, edit your campaign to target only mobile.

Tip: It’s important to note here that traffic is not equal. A significantly higher CPC might lead to the improved conversion of the traffic. Carry out duplicate campaigns and look at the shifts in cost and measure the ROI more efficiently.
7. Determine Peak Hours and Days; Run Campaigns Accordingly
Every campaign has peak times, and you will quickly find out that some days and hours work much better for you than others. Once you have determined the best converting days/hours, adjust your campaigns accordingly. It’s known as Dayparting as well, i.e. breaking campaigns into different times according to traffic suitability. It helps us in utilizing the best converting traffic while saving money on the traffic that doesn’t pay off.

7469,RedTrack just got better. 2020 in features,"The end of the year always makes us feel a little nostalgic. 2020 was something unusual for all of us, but we can't deny the fact that it was a game-changing year. We spoke a lot about the influence of COVID on the industry in our posts, we launched several excellent pdf guides related to this topic, but now we want to put it aside for a moment. RedTrack ends the year as it started it: with many updates, improvements, and enhancements - all possible thanks to our users. 

For the past year, RedTrack had almost weekly updates! All in all, 

We have made no fewer than 76 feature updates in 2020.

2020 in RedTrack updates - how was it? 
Twelve months of 2020 just flew by. But we offer you to look back - do you know that each month reflects a particular feature that went live then and enhanced the way RedTrack users addressed tracking, reporting, and automation?
01 JAN: Multi-access: new rules
Multi-access is one of the top RedTrack features used by media buyers, agencies, and publishers. While the multi-access itself was released a couple of years ago and made collaborative work on ad campaigns and budgets much easier for teams. In January, our team released an update and added more rules to the feature, i.e.: 

 	additional access rules: if you're an admin of a RedTrack account, you can share with your team members additional permissions to your data, like logs (clicks &amp; conversions) and publishers' data.
 	additional levels of access to data: besides 'read-only' mode, you can also grant 'edit' and 'export' permissions to your team members.

02 FEB: Auto-rules &amp; alerts: more options
Again, RedTrack was the first ad tracker that released auto-rules on the market of trackers. It happened in 2019 and marked the in-depth API-integration of RedTrack with several traffic sources, like Google, MGID, ExoClick, and others. This feature made possible the connection of different sources to RedTrack to perform automated actions, like auto-update cost, campaign optimization based on performance, auto-pause of poorly performing elements, etc. 

&gt; Learn more: Automation revolution: new RedTrack feature-set
In 2020, we've improved and updated:

 	the frequency of auto-update cost for the integrated traffic sources from 1 hour to 15 minutes;
 	added webhooks as the method of getting alerts when the rule doesn't perform  as expected (before, only email notifications);
 	included extra options for auto-rules, based on subID performance (example of subID can be bidding keyword, ad position, etc.)

03 MAR: 10+ traffic sources added to Auto-rules 
In 2020, we API-integrated more than ten traffic partners with RedTrack. At the moment, we have 23 sources added to the auto-rules, and we keep growing the list.
→ Check the full list of API-integrated traffic sources. 
Haven't found the one you work with? Contact us with the request, and we would put it on our priority board. 
04 APR: Universal tracking script
With the RedTrack Universal tracking script, you can see everything that happens to your traffic and leads across all your funnels. One script helps you attribute all incoming traffic across all paid, affiliate, and direct campaigns without making additional changes. You don't need to adjust any tracking parameters -- just put the script on every page of your website and get accurate and transparent analytics on the traffic you get. 

Contact our team to set the Universal tracking script for your website. 
05 MAY: Multiple improvements in Publisher panel 
The publisher panel is a separate portal developed by the RedTrack team to provide our users with a customizable white-label solution for managing publishers, affiliates, campaigns, offers, and more.

[caption id=""attachment_7502"" align=""alignnone"" width=""2880""] Create a campaign in your white-label Panel[/caption]

The most popular scenario of using the Publisher panel among RedTrack users are:
- building an affiliate network with the white label;
- launching your own affiliate program and giving the public access to it;
- managing influencers and providing them a workspace to track the value and revenue they bring in the overall marketing efforts;
- attracting affiliates to promote your direct offers and products.

2020 was a fruitful year for the Publisher panel as well. Besides some minor enhancements and updates, we also released: 

 	Conditional postbacks. It allows you to choose the type(s) of conversions you want to send to your publishers (e.g., only approved ones);
 	Additional white-label &amp; workspace settings. Now you can set the way you want your publishers to see the dashboards (columns and reports) and attach your own Privacy Policy / Terms and Conditions links; 
 	Sync your email domains. So your publishers would receive emails from name@your_brand.com and not from admin@redtrack.io;
 	Limited access. You can choose if you want to grant public access to the registration in your Panel or just by invitation. As well as limit access of your publishers to payment and financial information.

06 JUN: Multiple improvements in Reporting portal

The reporting portal is a go-for-solution for every mature agency that values transparency and privacy. You can set-up a white-label reporting portal for advertisers and provide them with real-time access to performance reports. It's a win-win solution, as you save time by not doing a 'cut-n-paste' job with tons of data and numbers, and your partners value the transparency and convenience you give them with a customized portal provided just for them.
07 JUL: Workspace settings 

We added more flexibility in the way you see and work with your dashboards. You can now show/hide and reposition the columns you see in your reports and create report templates to access the data even faster. 
08 AUG: Custom conversion events 
For the cases where you need to track more than one conversion event, we released 11 customizable types. So if you have a complex flow with several targeted events, like 'add-to-card' and 'purchase' flow, or 'conversion' and 'transaction', and 'renewal' flow - you can now track all these events as separate actions and see the performance of each step in your reports. This feature found pure love among our users who work with e-commerce in particular. 

By the way, we use RedTrack in our sales and marketing activities as well. In our SaaS-scenario, we use multiple conversion events to track such events as 'trial', 'subscription', and 'renew', for example. So as you can see, the feature's usability is broad and can be applied in any industry. 


09 SEP: Multi-currency 
Probably this was one of the top requested features, and we've finally moved it from beta to live. This feature allows you to receive the costs and payouts in different currencies and automatically transform them into your account currency. The rates are updated twice a day based on the information provided by the European Central Bank.

10 OCT: Real-time fraud detection 
As someone said - ""Bots were, are, and would be a permanent part of web traffic."" Still, everyone hopes that the ratio of human and bot traffic would be on the side of the first ones. Nevertheless, we launched our Fraud Report feature (in collaboration with our partners from FraudScore) last year, we keep improving it in 2020. 



Today, as an Anti-fraud suit at RedTrack, you get:

 	Real-time reporting on traffic quality. With the FraudScore technologies, we process and check every click based on 10+ criteria and report them in real-time in your RedTrack account. 
 	Bad traffic filtering. If you don't want to run bot traffic to your main offers but still don't want to exclude it entirely from your campaigns, you can now filter specific categories of this traffic (e.g., bad device clicks) and send them to a separate stream.
 	Automatic exclude of known bots from your reports. As you know, besides fraud traffic (e.g., click injection and cookiespamming, etc.), there are so-called 'good' bots. These are the bots by Google, Facebook, 3rd party tools that scroll your web pages. Still, they also generate clicks that influence your stats and contribute to inaccurate reports. In RedTrack, all known bots are automatically detected and excluded from your statistics (but if you want these bots to be displayed, you can set this rule in the workplace settings of your RedTrack account)

11 NOV: Time period (performance) comparison 
In 2020 we released the time period comparison feature that is so loved by Google Analytics users, but ad trackers lacked it. With this new feature, RedTrack users can now visually compare their campaigns' performance within different periods. For example, you can compare the number of clicks/sales and CR of the last week against the current one and react to the changes straightaway. 
12 DEC: Traffic source multi-account integration

We received dozens of requests for this feature in 2020. Now you can connect several Traffic Source accounts to one RedTrack account. This feature would be especially handy if you work with several Google / Facebook ad accounts.

&nbsp;
Instead of a summary...
These are just a few of the overall features that made it till the release in 2020. In everything we did and keep doing, be it onboarding assistance or lines of code, we always do it with our users in mind. In the end, RedTrack is not about technology only, but about our users: what they are looking for in the software, what can anticipate their needs, how new features will help them, and so on. 

Happy New Year 2021, everyone! ",12/29/2020,https://redtrack.io/blog/redtrack-2020-update/,All|RedTrack features|Updates
7533,After IOS 14 update: how to save our ads,"Breath in. Breath out.
Yes, the long-awaited IOS 14 update begins the influence. Privacy updates by all major companies have been in the public eye for quite a while. It's time to properly greet them if we want to successfully run the marketing game and continue ad tracking for results. Apple was the leader of the whole movement, and we have to admit: when Apple attempts to change the game — the game changes. So shall we forget about cross-site tracking, digital fingerprints, and Facebook pixels?


UPD: Btw, while we all were trying to deal with the consequences of iOS 14, a new player came around — the iOS 15 Update. Check out what RedTrack's CEO Vlad has to say about it. 


In a nutshell, what happens after IOS 14 Privacy Update?
Every IOS 14 user will get an ATT (App Tracking Transparency) prompt when downloading an app. This feature enables user protection against cross-site tracking and actually damages the personalization of your ads.



We don't know how many users will choose not to be tracked, but we can guess. Early estimations say that around 80% of users will opt-out of ad tracking. Does it hurt? A lot. There is a straightforward truth to that: there is no going back. We have to accept the new rules of the ad game. But firstly, we have to be well-equipped for this sudden landing.
So who exactly is under the influence of the Privacy update?
Well, almost everyone. Everyone who is involved in the industry of delivering / arbitraging / receiving ads through IOS devices. First of all, it affected key players on the market: Facebook, Tiktok, and Snapchat and their ability to track users and perform effective campaigns.
Facebook Ad Management — that is probably the biggest pain of this day (thanks to the IOS 14 update). Starting 19th of January, Facebook updated us with information about only eight conversion events per domain. As well as default switch to a 7-day click and 1-day view attribution setting. If for advertisers, it might not be that much of a problem, for affiliate marketers out there, it definitely is. Facebook's response in the usage of Facebook Conversion API and Aggregated Events Measurement. One of the requirements on the Facebook side was domain verification.
Check out the video explainer we created about Facebook Conversion API and be prepared to all the changes with Facebook after iOS 14.5 Update rolled out!


What is the impact on us?
Let's see what will never be the same:

 	audience-building
 	targeting
 	re-marketing
 	in-app attribution tracking

These features will not disappear, but advertisers will experience a decrease in the quality and quantity of those actions for users of IOS 14. However, the Apple update is definitely not the end of the world.
What happens next in 2021
ATT (App Tracking Transparency) is like an intro to the world of ad tracking block, which gives us a fair chance to prepare. Later in 2021, Google shall introduce its Privacy Sandbox. Let's try to do simple math.

If IOS 14 users are only a small part of all internet users, Google Chrome users are a much bigger share of the internet traffic. That means the ""old way"" of cross-site tracking, digital fingerprinting, and inserting pixels on your pages will not allow you to correctly build a marketing campaign across all devices and the most prominent part of internet traffic. There is nothing we can do about it, but ad tracking and conversion attribution have to change.
How IOS 14 impacts RedTrack platform
We started preparing for this day (third-party cookies dying day) a few years ago. RedTrack.io is dedicated to bringing you solutions that solely depend on first-party data. Using S2S Postback URLs, we allow our customers to forget about pixels, digital fingerprints, and any other cross-site tracking technology. In a nutshell, Apple or Google updates do not matter to us, as we track and attribute across all web using the future-proof technology.

If you are interested in embedding S2S Postback URLs to track, optimize and manage your campaigns, you are welcome to book a demo with our team.



How do I save my place in the marketing game?
Apple started blocking third-party cookies in 2017. Slowly but thoroughly, those measures start affecting niche by niche. Everyone who followed the market's signal began developing strategies to tackle the tracking block. And that is what we have to do now. Follow the call, adapt and implement new technologies. And there is no single recipe to save your business. It depends on what exactly you do.

7565,Where to find traffic in 2021,"
Let's go beyond Google and Facebook Ads
Who are we without traffic? No matter how good your offer or product is — you do need to bring attention to your product via traffic sources. Sometimes it may seem that the only place we can go is Facebook Ads and Google Ads. But in this article, we would love to go beyond this obvious choice and dig into some alternative traffic treasures. As well, investigate what is diversification of traffic sources.
What is a traffic source?
Sometimes this term can be confusing, let's break it down a little.
Traffic source is the place that drives traffic to your website/offer/product.
Your traffic sources can be anything: from a posted tweet to obsolete ""word of mouth"". And if your strategy is about making a bet on a single source or a limited amount of them, most likely a huge amount of traffic is skipping your net.
Diversify traffic sources
So before we reveal common ways to find your perfect sources, we have to give you a heads up. Diversify. Diversification of your traffic sources works like mixing a dough. You take all the best ingredients and you knead it until all the ingredients are evenly distributed. A perfect pizza can come up only by putting all your love and attention on each step evenly. Same with skyrocketed sales: distribute your attention on various traffic sources, knead it thoroughly,  track the performance, optimize if needed and get a delicious result!

Where to find traffic?
1. Social Media
The use of social media is the hugest trend. We all know it, but so few people know how to execute it. We decided to compound a table that will help you navigate through different social networks and niches within them.

&nbsp;

Tinder

fitness, beauty, travel, e-com
Try to put ads to this network that are relevant to single people or those who seek :)



&nbsp;
2. Youtube Channel
Youtube is the second largest search engine after Google. So it does deserve a solid point of its own. People ask questions and expect to find video answers on YT, that gives you a fair chance to enter the race of getting at the top of Youtube's keywords.

You can come to Youtube with any niche and a type of product or offer because it's simply such a large network that has a place for any type of audience. Whether you sell car wheels or lip liners, you will surely find your sweet spot.

Try to go away from direct advertising on YT and focus on delivering value with a very native ad of your service somewhere closer to the end. YouTube people are very picky on this.
3. Ad Networks
Another fruitful way to find new traffic sources to your offer/product is using services of Ad Networks. There are different networks specialized in various types of advertisements: native ads, push ads, pop-ups, pop-unders, etc. 
We are going to quickly mention few platforms that could help you reach new formats in advertisement:

 	Taboola - native ads
 	MGID -  native ads
 	Adcash - push, native, interstitial, pop, banner, etc.
 	Propellers Ads - push ads, on-click, native, In-page push, etc.
 	RevContent - content marketing and native advertisement

But again, to properly utilize this traffic sources you may need a help from a proven ad tracker. In order to keep track of your campaigns across all networks and to optimize the performance, the solution like RedTrack could be a lifesaver. 

At RedTrack we have more than 80 integrations with Ad Networks and all of them are saved as templates. So if you wish to start tracking your ad campaigns with any of those networks, it would take you no time to install the whole tracking solution. 👌
4. SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
It may seem like a long-run with no immediate benefits. Of course, sometimes it's easier to pay for your Google Ads and get some instant results. But if you think that you don't want to lose your time on keyword optimization, remember the pizza rule! It's a mix of everything that makes your end product great and memorable.
Few of the tips to follow for your SEO:

 	Make an effort with content marketing: by creating content relevant to your Target Audience you may stumble upon great leads. Create content that drives value and is correlating with current hot topics to discuss. (For example, at the times of pandemics many brands started forming their advertising around quarantine).
 	Create short and actually searchable titles. Try to think how would you google yourself this issue before making a really bright, not impossible to find the article!
 	Drop your keywords in the first 100 words!
 	Improve your website's backlinks. Link other resources in your articles and work on coverage on other websites linking yours.
 	Try to make it to the Google Snippet. If you provide the best and the most accurate answer to the issue, Google will prioritize your website by placing it above all. Check an example below ⬇️


5. E-mail Marketing
Though many believe it's an annoying way of marketing, we want to fight this misconception. Remember, that even not every pizza is delicious! Of course, some e-mail newsletters are also boring and outdated. There is still a lot of value if you do it right 😎

 	Set up lead magnets for your Target Audience and gather their e-mails. The better your lead magnet is, the more accurate audience you will attract.
 	Automate e-mail funnels for your leads, customers, and ""abandoned carts"" 😪).
 	Test different sequences with different audiences to identify which carries the most fruits.
 	Provide value, don't just advertise your product/offer in each e-mail or you will be unsubscribed from.

6. Media coverage
Paid Media
First, we have to separate 2 types of media ads: paid and earned. Let's first discover what is paid media advertising. 

You can buy an ad placement on media platforms (like New York Times, Forbes, etc.). The usual pricing model is a flat rate, where you pay for a certain banner for a certain amount of time to be displayed on the platform. But this model gets less used day by day since it gives little control for advertisers over the performance of the campaign.

That's why CPA (cost per action) model appeared on the market. That means that you pay to the media platform for certain targeted actions of users on their website. It can be sign-ups, add to carts, purchases or any other type of action. But in order to get full control over a CPA model you need to use an ad tracker. Ad tracking is actually useful not only for media advertising, but for gathering data from all your traffic sources in one place in order to praise those who bring the most results and eliminate budget suckers. 🤟

Earned Media
Earned media coverage is the type where you have to work really hard. The benefit: it can be highly profitable if done right.

Creating content in collaboration with well-known media platforms is a way for success, surely. Being featured on those platforms increases trust in your brand or product, as well as generally raises your brand awareness. Creating valuable content that would be accepted by the media is truly hard work. But hard work pays off!

Also, consider posting on such platforms as Medium (or the same type of media relevant to your niche). Anyone can post there, but if an article is interesting, it can get a lot of views.

Search for a topic for your articles that is discussed at the moment. Follow the market trends or just the latest news to always know which topic will get more coverage (same as with YouTube). 
7. Influence marketing
We all have to live with a fact that it's been a long time when influence marketing left a niche for beauty-bloggers. Every single niche is now stuffed with bloggers whose audience you may use for your benefit.

Let's compare influence marketing with the modern term of ""word of mouth"". Influencers actually enable your product's/offer's visibility and people start talking about it. There are two significant reasons why it's good for you.

 	Influencers gather Target Audience with shared values and interests around themselves. So if you manage to find an influencer with the same TA as yours, it's a big win!
 	This TA actually trusts the blogger. If the influencer has a good record with his/her recommendations, the chance to skyrocket your sales is almost inevitable 😎

And a few tips to boost your influence marketing:

 	Check the approach of advertising/recommending before ordering a campaign with the influencer. Make sure the way they present the product matches your expectations. It's not only about the number of followers a blogger has, it is also about the quality of advertising.
 	Make an influencer fall in love with your product/offer. People value sincere feedback and the audience will feel in no time the deceitful recommendation. Actually, bloggers care about their reputation a lot, so most likely they will refuse your offer if you don't give them a chance to properly execute the thing that you sell.
 	Trust their creativity. And release. Sometimes we as product owners/advertisers think we always know better. However, the blogger does know his/her audience much better than you do. These people do blogging for a living because they can actually gather people around themselves and inspire trust. So let them choose how your campaign should look like for their audience.

8. Partner &amp; Affiliate marketing
Sometimes you may feel that you reached the top at your ""traffic game"". Eventually, there might be another brand that feels the same way! Partner marketing is all about credible alias who can help each other grow their audiences. If your businesses are functioning in a similar direction, but yet have slightly different audiences — you have a chance to catch the attention of both. It's all about interesting collaboration and conquering new targets.

A subdomain in partner marketing would be a partnership with affiliate networks. An affiliate network allows you to give out your offer to a wide range of affiliate marketers who basically will do all the work of promoting your product for you. You do have to share a percentage of sales (or other targeted actions) with both the network and affiliate marketers, but the good thing that you do not use any other resources of your company for advertisement purposes.
Don't forget bloggers/influencers can become your affiliate marketer too. If you start advertising with influencers, include not only video/photo ads, but also give bloggers special links or promo codes with certain conditions. Then they will be interested in driving more sales to your offer as it is a financial benefit to them as well.
If you wish to skip the step of sharing the percentage of a sale with the affiliate network, you might be interested in the next source from our list 😉
9. Referral program
If you already jumped into partner &amp; affiliate marketing, it would be a good idea to create a Referral Program! Do it yourself, they say!

By creating your White-label referral program you are able to automate your relationship with all affiliates, partners, and bloggers. Simple: you set your condition, you give each user a special link to track their sales, you get all the results of ad campaigns stored in one place 😎

There is literally an unlimited amount of partners you can attract when the offer is available publicly. But how to find a perfect affiliate marketer?

A good idea would be to use a platform that matches your type of business with a perfect affiliate. Something like tinder for running business and ads, let's say. For that purpose, you may like the tool from our partners at Publisher Discovery. This platform allows you to find the best marketers to advertise your offer or product within a certain vertical. This feature will enable you to scale your referral program limitless 🚀


10. Giphy
We wanted to throw some crazy ideas for you too! Sometimes absurd marketing decisions can bring amazing results too.

Gifs and memes are so trendy at the moment. If you create a gif with your logo that users instantaneously will start sharing across the internet — it is a quick win. The question is, is it relevant to your target audience? If you target a younger TA, we would definitely recommend you to try this sort of advertising. Once you do the job (create viral pic), the rest is done by the users. In no time your logo appears everywhere 😎

To start advertising through Giphy you need to:

 	Create a brand channel on Giphy
 	Research the topics you would like to create gifs about (maybe spy on your competitors 😎)
 	Research the keywords in your niche that you will be working with. A good idea would be to check the top gifs under each keyword, as well as the overall amount of gifs under the keyword.

If you think that Giphy is not for your business, these are the quick examples of how different companies utilize gifs for their marketing purposes: Starbucks, IKEA, or even trading company eToro.

&nbsp;
11. Country-related resources
If you are looking for market expansion, we would recommend looking into country-specific media. It can be anything from social networks, messengers, or search engines.

For example, if you are looking into the Chinese market, consider looking at Baidu, WeChat, etc.

If you are looking into the Russian-speaking market, look into Yandex, VK, etc.

It is a hard thing to transit into a different language/culture zone, but it gives you access to the audience you could never attract with all the traffic sources listed above. So if you have outdone yourself on all the previous stages, time to start conquering new markets 🚀
Conclusion
Concluding this amazing list of traffic sources, we have to remind you again of diversification. But to combine your traffic sources in the right way you do need to use an ad tracker. Ad tracking solutions will allow you to distinguish which sources work for you, the use of which sources have to be modified, and which sources have to be forgotten. You can always book a demo with RedTrack team to find out how our tracking solution will benefit your business and skyrocket your marketing strategy.

7608,Google Privacy Sandbox: Approaching Cookieless Future [Updated 2022],"Privacy matters &amp; cookies' death
We all have been surprised with approaching Google Privacy Sandbox in 2021. However, Google moved the dates to 2022 and 2023 in order to develop the technologies needed for advertisers to keep their performance. 
2022: But 2022 started with a new hassle: now Google wants to implement new privacy restrictions for Android users as well. There were a few more changes in the technologies that are in development. The FLoC idea changes for the so-called Topics API to introduce the same interest-based advertising. Let's see how Google is handling the cookieless future in this blog post. 
&nbsp;

Why is it important?? From the statistics below, we can clearly see that the most used browser is Google Chrome. If we believe this data, we can assume that things will change for 63% of internet users. And that's a considerable number.


Cookies Background
Before we dig into big and scary Sandbox, let's go through the phenomenon of cookies.
Cookies are the little pieces of code stuck to your browsing history and saving information about your activity on the web. In the same way that it's hard to stay away from cookies in real life, it is hard to get away from them on the web.
But! All cookies are different. Like there is a difference between sugary-buttery cookies and wholegrain Wholefoods cookies, there are different web cookies. You have to know the difference between these two:

 	First-party cookies. These cookies store your information when you log in to different resources, so you don't have to fill in your password each time. Or they help you find a page you have been visiting recently — it takes the browsing experience to another level.
 	Third-party cookies. On the contrary, these guys are full of S-spying. Basically, they get stuck to your browsing history, transmit your data, and then you get a feeling that targeted ads are all around you, showing you things you recently googled. And sometimes, it can show things that you did not necessarily want to share with the world!

Users' Privacy is important
Most likely, if you are reading this, you work for the advertising industry, and all changes of 2021 are not playing in your favor. iOS 14 has been messing things up; Facebook has been such a pain, the Google Privacy Sandbox is approaching (and yes, it is real). Probably you feel like you want everything to go back to its place (smells like a rewind of 2020 😂).

However, we recommend you pull yourself together, do your research, and adapt as soon as you can. Because 2021 is gonna be challenging, but if you make the right moves now, you will win on a long race against your competitors. Users' privacy matters are essential, and it was a long due issue. The Internet has to be a safer place to store our personal information. No matter whether we work in the industry, we are users ourselves. And we doubt you want it to be an unhealthy space.
What is Google Privacy Sandbox?
Google Privacy Sandbox is an initiative that takes users' privacy in the first place. As Google says, Sandbox's mission is to ""Create a thriving web ecosystem that is respectful of users and private by default."" Sounds great, but what exactly happens in this mysterious Box?

Briefly, Sandbox is a complex of actions that will bury third-party cookies, tracking as we know it. Instead, create five APIs to replace the functionality that advertisers require (like conversion measurements, attribution modeling, etc.).

[caption id=""attachment_7614"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""735""] Google Privacy Sandbox from the inside[/caption]


Let's break down each initiative to understand better what is awaiting.
Elimination of third-party cookies, cross-site tracking &amp; digital fingerprinting
Google is committed to reach an end-game for third-party cookies, ensure that there no more hidden techniques to transmit users' data and track their activity on the web. We have to say that it took a long time for Google to take proper actions. To compare, Safari (Apple) introduced similar measures in 2017, Firefox in 2019.

Why? Google is one of the key players in the ad market, so we assume they took their time to prepare substitutes for their advertising partners. Google is developing new technologies that will allow creating marketing and targeting for audiences in a ""safe way"". More about it in the next point.

We have to make it clear that it's not a horror story that has no relation to reality. It is a new reality we are going to face in 2021 — advertising, remarketing, targeting without third-party cookies.
Introduction of Interest-based Advertising
Interest-based advertising consists of two parts:

 	Introduction of FLoC (Federal Learning of Cohorts)
Instead of cookie-based targeting to individuals browsing on the web, FLoC will create targeting for groups of people. In other words, Google calls it ""interested-based advertising"". According to their interests, Internet users will be associated with a particular group, and ads will be focused on specific groups corresponding to its' marketing needs.

[caption id=""attachment_7613"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""739""] Cookie-based targeting VS Interest-based targeting[/caption]


So Google does create ""healthy alternatives"" to ancient targeting. However, there are a few question marks here and there. FLoC is still under the experiment, so it is hard to predict how good it will be in action. It will most likely take some time for developers at Google to adjust the new algorithm for it to work the way we advertisers want it to work.

Will FLoC be as effective for us as advertisers as targeting? Nobody can answer that too, at this point. There is a chance that interest-based advertising will not work as groups do not show as much accuracy as individual targeting. However, it might have a different effect. Only time will show ;)

&nbsp;
 	 Introduction of TURTLEDOVE
This API recreates an ""auction"" like environment for remarketing. The API is taking into consideration ads that are only relevant to your previous interest. The ""auction algorithm"" decides which ad has to be shown at this moment to this user. At the same time, ensuring not to link data interest individually and keep their information safe.

In a nutshell, API makes sure that ads in pulled out on the users' screen according to contextual data and previous interest, however not giving ad network private information about a user, his/her browsing activity, or his/her choice.
Ad Fraud Prevention
To tackle Ad Fraud, Google is working on Trust Token API, which will enable verifying the authentic traffic by giving ""trust token"". This API is encouraging users to prove their authenticity without revealing identity. Basically, Trust Token is not personalized and can not be used to track user's activity. At the same time, they are dedicated to ensuring that this user is not a bot but a real human or service.

We can not but think of Black Mirror 😄 Google is giving us tokens to make sure we are credible and trustworthy enough. Well, jokes aside, this is to the benefit not only for users but advertisers as well. Internet as a safe place where you are not afraid to be scammed is definitely a place to be.

Trust Tokens API has been in test since July and open for use. And starting March, Google is planning to start a full-on trial of the new API. Let's see where it brings us.
Conversion Measurement
Measuring advertisement/campaign results and performance is a crucial part of the ad industry. And Google (as a key player) could not simply go away from it. To ensure that performance tracking is still allowed, Google is introducing Conversion Measurement API.

This initiative's main task is to track conversion events and perform attribution while taking care of users' privacy. The information about impressions and conversions has to stay inside the browser. Two decisions will power it:

 	Click-through conversion measurement level: understanding which clicks turn into conversions.
 	Aggregated reporting: taking reports from multiple websites and users to keep individual's private information.

Industry's concerns with Google Privacy Sandbox
All things that Google is doing may appear noble to a novice internet user. But remember how long it took Google to start making these implementations in comparison to others?

Eventually, the CMA started an investigation in order to check if updates from Google Sandbox will not cause even further focus of the ad industry on Google Ecosystem and cause monopoly at the expense of other players. We have to understand that while we as advertisers, business owners, or simple internet users get restricted from getting info (or being ""protected"" as Google says), Google still receives and stores all the information about us. It may cause an increase in the cost of advertisement and an increase in Google's stock evaluation. Should we trust Google? Those multiple lawsuits are endangering Privacy Sandbox, but we think that the chance to eliminate it is pretty low. So we'll see by the cost of ads and stock markets if the monopoly has been officially formed 😉
Consequences for the ad industry &amp; and what can you do now?
Let's see what will never be the same:

 	audience-building
 	targeting
 	remarketing
 	tracking of users activity on the web

Even though Google is working on multiple decisions now to substitute the loss, we still don't know how effective those decisions are going to be and how soon these decisions will be sufficient. At this moment, we, as ad experts, have to make sure we are ready to operate without third-party data, cross-site tracking, and digital fingerprinting. Gathering and functioning only with first-party data is essential. So if you are not into it now, you should by the end of this article.

An easy solution would be to use a future-proof tracker that uses first-party data to track conversion events and perform attribution modeling. Our team at RedTrack has dedicated the last several years to make sure that we are prepared for the times without cookies. But we always wanted to keep it tasty. 😄

The most straightforward strategy to go now is to use S2S Postback URLs (Server-to-Server) to keep the performance of your campaigns under control and gather data about your ads from multiple resources in one place and optimize your ad performance.



Leave cookies on the shelves
A lot of uncertainty awaits, but we have to stay on top. Doing your research at times like this is crucial to make sure you do the best for your business, and you use all the proper tools. A quick piece of advice would be to stop using third-party data now and get used to the reality where cookies are only on the stores' shelves, not stuck to users' browsers. A new (maybe healthy) Internet is coming, and we have to adjust our advertising to it.

Are you looking into diversifying your GEOs? Ever wondered how to step into Thailand GEO?

In this detailed article, you will find TA peculiarities, the most profitable offers, combos, and creatives.
Target audience profile: population, languages, preferences
Thailand, officially the Kingdom of Thailand, is a country in Southeast Asia. It is a country of beautiful beaches, royal palaces, ancient ruins, and Buddhist temples.

Thai is the official language of the country. Besides, there are a lot of people who speak English, Chinese and Japanese. However, it is better to use texts in Thai, as the majority of the population speaks Thai. Ask your personal manager if you need any help with the translation.



&nbsp;
Thai people and the internet: popular websites
Google, Facebook, and Youtube are among the most popular websites. Pantip – popular Thai forum goes forth. Google.co.th and messenger Line.me take the 5th and 6th places. Twitter ranked 7th and the news website Sanook.com – as 8th. Adult website Xvideos.com and one more news portal Thairath.co.th are the last in this top.


TOP-5 social media networks
We have already mentioned that Thai people love to spend time on the internet. 75% of the population use social media networks and most of them use their mobile phone for this purpose. In addition to world-popular Facebook, Instagram and Twitter Thai people also use messenger Line.



However, don't forget that in order to track results across multiple channels and campaigns (including social media), you will need help from a reliable ad tracking solution for affiliate marketers. At RedTrack, we are bringing a platform that is a single source of truth for all your advertising activities. Ad tracker helps you consolidate the data from multiple channels, report conversion events to your advertising partners, and optimize ads according to campaigns that bring the most results. 






Online shopping: peculiarities and preferences

Women’s audience could be interested in weight loss offers and skin whitening offers. Men’s audience will appreciate adult offers.
Health problems
Life expectancy is not so high in Thailand. On average Thai people live about 75 years. The figure could be more, but there are some health problems such as drinking issues, smoking and an unhealthy diet. Such addiction affects health and male fertility.

Both women and men dream to become slim once and forever. Therefore there is a high demand for weight loss products. 

One more problem – parasites. Thailand is a tropical country, so there are a variety of living creatures. Pests could find its victim in unexpected places. 

And lastly, joints and varicose remedies could find a target audience in this country too.
What sources of traffic to use?
Facebook, Google, MGid, Adnow, Yengo

7687,How Facebook Conversion API changes your advertising?,"What is happening with Facebook Ads?
Right from the start of the year, we got hit. There was no time for rest this January since Apple released the Privacy Update which forced Facebook to implement few changes too. (Oh, was Apple really to be blamed?😜) So all this time we were figuring out how to not get your Business Manager blocked, what the hell is  Facebook CAPI, why do we need to verify the domain? 

So many questions and so few solutions. In this article, we are going to shed some light on what is happening and what is changing as well as propose solutions to everything that hurts with Facebook Ads. Get on board!

By the way, if you still didn’t figure out how to integrate CAPI, start conversion tracking &amp; optimize for the events of your choice, check out the guide our team prepared!


What has changed in Facebook Ads Manager?
First, let's define all the changes that we witnessed in January and February 2021:

 	Click-Attribution window changed from 28-day to 7-day (hell yeah!)
 	View-attribution is changed from 7-day to 1-day (hell yeah! x2)
 	8 Conversion events per domain restriction
 	Only 1 event prioritization
 	Facebook CAPI introduction as an alternative to Facebook Pixel
 	Recommendation (or requirement 🧐?) to verify domains

We can see a very vivid trend of a decrease of available information for advertising. It affects information for Facebook algorithms which have now fewer opportunities to improve your campaigns. We are talking about targeting, remarketing, and basic tracking of your campaigns' performance.
Why Facebook is going crazy?
Our approach actually contradicts the general opinion. We believe that everything that is happening now around Facebook Ads is good for us because these actions prepare us for something bigger and scarier. Apple already released its' Privacy Update, but Google Chrome is just preparing the biggest attack on third-party cookies. How are third-party cookies and Facebook changes connected?

Well, Facebook Pixel is a technology that will not work once third-party data disappears since pixels sit on a webpage and work on a user side. A similar problem caused the need for domain verification. This way Facebook authenticates the source of the advertisement as a way to promote privacy.

So Facebook is preparing us for yet to come grand problems we will face with the Google Privacy Sandbox Ecosystem (we already made a very detailed article about it — Google Privacy Sandbox: Approaching Cookieless Future).
Primarily, the things that are going on right now is just a huge rehearsal for cookieless marketing &amp; advertising.
In the light of these events, we decided to create a community for marketers who face problems with Facebook Ads and are looking for solutions. We want to promote an approach where we help. each other out, support fellow advertisers and find the coolest insights from industry experts. Don't hesitate to join to learn about conversion tracking &amp; attribution with Facebook Ads 😏


If you are not a product owner, you need to take action now
Changes in Facebook Ads don't affect vendors and advertisers as much as they do for affiliate marketers and other advertising partners. Why did this problem occur?

In the picture above, you can see that information from the vendor (advertiser) now is not passed to Facebook Pixel (or other Data Sources). And since affiliate marketers do not have access to websites where conversion actually happens, we end up in trouble. At RedTrack, we have been focusing our powers on figuring out how to make Facebook Conversion API work in the best possible way at this unprecedented time and we made a few out-of-the-box solutions for Facebook Ads. Let's get into it!
Domain Verification Solution for Facebook Ads
As mentioned above, there is now a requirement to verify domains where conversion event happens. But what do you do if you don't own this domain? RedTrack offers a solution that helps pass the information from a domain where conversion happens to Facebook Data Source and Facebook Ad Account. All you have to do as third-party advertisers in this case — verify your landing page and RedTrack will take care of the rest. In the picture below, you can see how our technology works.


Seamless Facebook CAPI setup
Another issue that we faced was the need to switch to Facebook Conversion API instead of Facebook Pixel. Firstly, let's discover how Facebook Pixel is different from Facebook CAPI.

Facebook Pixel:

 	Sits on the web-page
 	Core info is collected by Facebook, after you set it up
 	Additional info is collected by Facebook

Facebook Conversion API

 	Works from server-side
 	You need to collect and provide core and additional info to Facebook directly



What are Facebook CAPI benefits?

 	Complements Facebook pixel (until it works)
 	Can duplicate events in pixel, when Facebook has event deduplication
 	Works for online and offline conversions
 	Works great for affiliates with no access to thank you page through pixel
 	Can feed data you need to Facebook

 	Event types (different cost value in eyes of Facebook)
 	Event URLs (so affiliates can work around limitations)



So how do you set up Facebook CAPI?
You can do it yourself, but at RedTrack we offer a seamless CAPI setup, that allows you to feed data about conversions to RedTrack and then pass it to Facebook Ad Manager. Using the RedTrack solution also gives you access to more settings that help you improve attribution on the Facebook side. RedTrack allows you to go beyond the click and view-attribution windows in Facebook set for 7 and 1 days, accordingly. Apart from that, you get access to automated cost-updates via Facebook API, ability to set rules and alerts for the management of your campaigns and their auto-optimization.

If you want to learn more about the set of solutions that RedTrack offers you to improve your advertising, be sure to contact us and book a demo with our technical specialists.


Conclusion
No doubt, it's been a stressful couple of months. Our team is doing its' best to help educate marketers about the cookieless world as well as developing amazing solutions to help you survive without it. Remember to always be ready to adapt to marketing &amp; advertising challenges. And we are going to cover your bases with first-party data tools. 😎",3/2/2021,https://redtrack.io/blog/facebook-capi-changing-advertising-in-2021/,All|Articles|Industry
7718,Domain verification in Facebook Business Manager: Step-by-step guide,"If you doing at least some advertising, you probably already faced issues with Facebook Ads ever since the iOS 14 Privacy Update was released. If you still didn't get your Business Manager blocked (lucky you!), you probably heard about the shift to Facebook Conversion API and a requirement for domain verification in Facebook Business Manager. The latter one has been quite a problem for everyone who does not have access to the domain where the actual conversion event happens.

If you want to learn more about Facebook CAPI, we suggest you read our previous article ""How Facebook Conversion API changes advertising?"". But if you still haven't figured out how to verify domains (especially when it comes to affiliate landing pages), this piece of content is for you!

By the way, if you still didn’t figure out how to integrate CAPI, start conversion tracking &amp; optimize for the events of your choice, check out the guide our team prepared!

&nbsp;

Fasten your seat belt, we will drive you through a domain verification solution 😎
Why do you need to verify a domain on Facebook?  
Domain verification in Facebook Business Manager requirement came right after the iOS 14 Privacy Update by Apple was rolled out. Domain verification is necessary for Facebook to promote privacy and make sure that only trusted people are using the account.
Besides, when you verify the domain gives you the right to manage permissions over your links and controls the ""misuse of your account"" as Facebook states. 
Note: you can't make edits to your Pages unless your domain is verified in Facebook Business Manager.
Another reason is that after domain verification Facebook receives the data to enable prioritization of 8 conversion events per domain. Without this data, Facebook Business Manager can not make a priority for designated conversion events. The decrease of available conversion events for measurement is also the consequence of the iOS 14 Privacy Update. 

If you want to learn more about the topic, make sure to read this article — After iOS 14 Update: How to save our ads (BONUS! Find preparation checklist in the article).

Ways of domain verification in Facebook Business Manager 
There are 3 main ways to verify a domain in Facebook Business Manager:

 	
DNS Verification;

 	
HTML File Upload;

 	
Meta-Tag Verification.


We find that DNS Verification is the simplest option. It is easy enough for a simple marketing &amp; advertising expert who never made a piece of code longer than ""Hello World!"" pop up.

However, the DNS verification requires access to the domain settings. Which you typically can not find if you do not own the domain. So that's the case when affiliate marketers &amp; other advertising partners may suffer. Facebook did not provide an opportunity to perform verification for third-party domains. Verification can be made only for domains where conversion events happen — this is a way to promote transparency.
Solution for third-party domain verification in Business Manager
Putting interests of affiliate marketers &amp; other third-party advertisers in the first place, our team at RedTrack.io started looking for the solution. Actually, like we always do 😉
What we managed to do is to provide you a chance to verify your third-party domain through our tracking &amp; attribution platform. If you use RedTrack as your tracker you will manage to verify your affiliate landing page in no time.
In a nutshell, we make sure that all you have to do is to verify the domain (where conversions happen) inside a tracker and our platform will do the rest to make Facebook think that your Landing page is the actual place of conversions.

If you haven't tried using our tracking &amp; attribution solution before, we provide a 14-day free trial for you to properly test our platform. So you might try set up Facebook CAPI integration and verify your domains as well.


Step-by-step guide: how to verify domain with RedTrack
Let's get right into the step-by-step guide on how to verify the domain in Facebook Business Manager using the RedTrack platform. 
1. Go to your Business Manager account ➡️ Brand Safety ➡️ Domains
2. Press Add button ➡️ Add your domain



Domains will not appear in your list immediately, give the system some time to replicate the data.
3. Select the target domain, choose DNS verification

4.  Copy your unique TXT value and go to your domain registrar
5. Open DNS settings and add a new record with the following values:
Host: @Points to: your unique TXT record from point 4TTL: the lowest possible

The steps you need to perform to add a DNS TXT record to your DNS settings may vary by domain host.
Wait for some time for the data replication and press verify button in your Facebook domain settings.
6. Associate the domain with your page:
Green spot means the domain is verified.



7. Proceed with the rest of the setup
Once you are done with setting in Facebook, you can proceed with the rest of the set up on the RedTrack's side.

Make Facebook accept the conversion domain from RedTrack. To do that, add the same domain you have already verified inside your RedTrack offer settings.

Set the Action Source (the type of the conversion to be set for Facebook API):



Add your verified domain here (a root domain will work fine as well):


The domain should be secure, use the following link format: https://your.domain.com
Domain verified, advertising secured
We hope that this simple guide made it possible for you to verify your domain and continue advertising through Facebook. RedTrack's team is always happy to have your back when another painful update from the advertising giants roll out.

George, Global Marketing Manager

Challenges for Financer.com 
When planning the scale of their product at Financer, the team wants to shift away from intuition-based decisions, but trust a reliable data source that can help make better choices.

The biggest share of Financer’s revenue comes from affiliate deals. That means that actual purchases (or conversion events) are happening outside of the website. This creates a need to get data from the side of affiliate advertising partners. 

The data from partners is crucial to understand the user journey, optimize marketing &amp; advertising campaigns and create a better product day-by-day.
Challenges that Financer faced before the use of RedTrack.io:

 	No understanding about UI &amp; UX effectiveness 
 	No understanding about offers CTR
 	Absence of ability to measure conversions rates &amp; profitability
 	Lack of information to optimize PPC campaigns
 	Absence of ability to confirm data accuracy with Affiliate Partners
 	Absence of ability to Identify issues in the conversion funnels


George: We just were tired of relying on our intuition to make marketing decisions, we needed to become more data driven if we wanted to optimize our inner processes, scale and raise profits.

Goals that Financer.com set before choosing ad tracker: 
Summing up all the challenges Financer was facing before going out to the market in search of ad tracking solutions, their team set the following goals. Establish proper management of the relationship between affiliate advertising partners since affiliate deals generate the most income. As well as find a solution to help understand the user journey to be able to shift to the data-informed decisions instead of blind tests. 
Ad tracking market research &amp; comparison
Financer's team decided to tackle this task strategically. Before even setting trials with any platforms, they conducted a thorough market research, gathering detailed information about around 20 ad trackers on the market.

In the end, Financer ended up trying solutions from Voluum, TrackingDesk, Post Affiliate Pro and Thrive. Every platform had disadvantages here and there: unreliable data, poor customer support, lack of features, etc.

George: On the contrary, RedTrack was that one solution that had everything we are looking for combined. We got access to reliable and granular data in reports seeing clicks and conversion events from multiple angles as a “bird-eye view”. 

Choosing RedTrack as a solution
Once Financer started testing RedTrack, they discovered that it offers a wide range of features that go beyond simple tracker abilities. The features were matching with the goals that Financer set.


Features that the Financer's team apply in the work process
The first thing that George implemented was a universal tracking script. This feature enabled the tracking of the traffic across all funnels that the marketing team created. They are tracking all types of campaigns, like paid ads with different sources, affiliate deals as well as organic reach.
With all the data that was tracked, it was crucial to look at it from different angles to be able to make viable conclusions. Multi-touch reporting was a top feature to be able to play with tracked data, get a ""granular"" look from all campaigns and offers. Financer was able to create a fully custom report with all the events they needed to analyze in one dashboard. 

As one of the goals was the optimization of relationships between partners, Reporting Portal played a key role to establish a transparent relationship between all affiliates. With the ability to verify conversion, clicks, and other targeted actions with all affiliates they gained an understanding of the most profitable deals. Independent platform helped George at time of discrepancy to solve any disputes. 

With all the data gained from Financer and RedTrack collaboration, it was necessary to make changes, optimize advertising &amp; marketing strategy, fix bugs, and develop new solutions. WIth Multi-access feature, George was able to optimize collaboration between development, marketing, and operations teams inside Financer.com and work on the projects effectively. 

And last, but not least came an Automation feature with very important outcome. Setting rules and alerts helped control performance of campaigns with no need to constantly check the dashboard for insights. With automated campaigns, Financer got to fix issues before they become dents in a budget. 

George: Another interesting outcome that we got from RedTrack — improved UX &amp; UI of our website. All the features mentioned above and access to data gave a chance to quickly understand which design &amp; development decisions do not work for users.

7856,Sweepstakes & Affiliate Marketing in 2021,"It was a truly shaky year, affiliate marketing industry including. Therefore, we wanted to learn more about one of the trendiest niches in affiliate marketing — sweepstakes. How did sweepstakes cope with all the changes that 2020 brought? Let’s find out all the trends of sweepstakes in 2021 from Q&amp;A with Big Bang Ads representative Vincent. 



&nbsp;

Vincent Jouvin,
Business Development &amp; Industry Specialist
Big Bang Ads Affiliate Network for Single-opt-in sweepstake offers
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
What are sweepstakes? 
Affiliate Marketing sweepstakes is a type of offer where users have to sign-up (or perform another target action) to win something. Some of the common prizes are travel vouchers, iPhones, gift cards, etc. 

Typically, sweepstakes are divided into 2 main categories: Credit card info submits and e-mail submits. 

 🖇 If you want to learn more about running sweepstake offers, make sure to check out our guide. But in this article, we are going to discuss the main changes from 2020 and trends for sweepstakes in 2021. Follow along! 
Running sweepstakes in 2021: Q&amp;A with Big Bang Ads
2020 has been a tough year for many verticals and niches. But how was sweepstakes vertical doing this past year?
Lead gen sweeps are not different from other verticals. Our business model will exist for another 5 to 10 years. Of course, we are under the influence because our clients on the coregistration side (calls centers or direct clients) are impacted. However, we are in the industry for 20 years now because we were able to adapt, and we will keep adapting to make our company a success. 
What ad formats are trending right now for sweepstakes and you would recommend going for?
Vincent considers Facebook not a good place to start running sweepstake offers since it's getting tricky. Many affiliates face account bans and other problems with Facebook Ads. On the contrary, push and pop traffic could be a good option where you are required to use less targeting, fewer tools and you have to invest less time to be truly successful.
Our media buyers at Big Bang Ads are truly successful with Real-Time Bidding Advertising. The competition is not fierce there. If you can get a spot with an RTB platform, it's definitely worth a test!
Would you say that sweepstakes are still booming in 2021? 
I have been asked this question for all 8 years that I work with Big Bang Ads. If it is not booming, it is still the core business model for our company with more than 150 employees, it still feeds hundreds of affiliates worldwide, and new advertisers try their luck to enter the market every year! 
Have you seen a decrease in CR over the years as users are losing trust in the ""lotteries"" on the internet?
At Big Bang Ads, they believe that every problem (especially the one of losing trust) needs to have a solution. For instance, Big Bang created a ""testers landing page"", where users can test the product advertised on the offer page. Back a few years ago, Big Bang inserted prelanders before the conversion page in order to engage users on the flow. But now it is considered an industry standard and you will not see an affiliate redirecting traffic from the ad directly to the conversion page without using a prelander. 
A simple conclusion from these examples is that you always have to adapt and find creative solutions for your offers.
There is one thing we are sure about — there will always be plenty of users for 2 reasons. people want to win and people want things for free. This is ultimately what we propose!
What are the top-5 GEOs to go for then as of 2021?
From the Big Bang Ads experience these are the top Geos for sweeps: 

 	
Europe: Germany, United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, and France

 	
Asia Pacific: New Zealand, Australia, Singapore, Taiwan, or Thailand.


Would you recommend the same GEOs for newbies or is it better to start with less-competitive locations?
No matter you are an experienced marketer or a newbie, you need to have a good strategy. With a well-planned strategy, you can choose a Tier 1 Geo and go for Germany or Australia. But if you expect to have less competition in a Tier 2 (like Thailand), you are wrong!
Are iPhones still the most profitable prizes for sweepstakes or there are other products to look at in 2021?
iPhones are still amongst the top 10 highest revenue landing pages in every country that we run. But with the pandemic, the landing pages which have been promoted changed a bit.
Amongst the Top-10 worldwide popular offers, you would also find:

 	Carrefour voucher
 	Nivea voucher
 	 Ferrero Kinder
 	 iPhone 11 and 12
 	Decathlon or Amazon voucher

How useful is an ad tracker for affiliates who are working with sweepstakes?
A simple warning: Do not run lead gen sweeps without a tracker! You will not be able to automate, optimize and control your ad spend. 
At RedTrack, we offer ad tracking &amp; conversion attribution solutions for solo affiliates or affiliate networks. With the features offered by RedTrack, you can easily automate your performance, analyze campaigns across all channels, and do data-informed decisions for optimization instead of creatives blind tests.
You have a chance to sign-up for a 14-day free trial to properly test the platform and see the influence on your performance. 
What strategies would you recommend for testing the campaign on sweepstakes? What metrics should they follow?
Vincent from Big Band Ads recommends looking at the following metrics: 

 	Metrics to follow would be the EPC (Earning Per Click) 
 	Metrics not to follow are payouts. Simple reason — advertisers scrub.

Strategies depend on your budget and the traffic source that you will be using. There are dozens of valid strategies. I will try to explain my strategy if I were to start with push traffic. 
Pick 3 locations

 	Germany (DE): strongest GEO at Big Bang
 	France (FR): a native language for Vincent
 	Belgium (FR): the French speakers in Belgium – native language with less competition than France

Create 3 landing pages per GEO
Vicent recommends selecting 3 landing pages per GEO: a 3 choice supermarket, a single supermarket, a trendy product like PS5. 3 landing pages for 3 GEOs, that’s a total of 9 tracking links. 
Create 2-3 creatives with prelanders
After looking at the landing pages, Vincent recommends creating 2 or 3 creatives with prelanders and set them on a 72 hours rotation with a 100€ budget a day per country on either Propeller Ads or Zeropark.
Remove creatives that do not work
In the first 72 hours, remove the creatives that do not work. That should be enough work for 72 hours!  
Maybe you can share the most interesting and unexpected insight from your statistics as of 2020-2021? 
We distributed in Europe the same amount of payout to affiliates in 2019 and 2020! 
Sources of traffic in volume on Big Bang Ads:

 	Push / pop traffic: 30% in 2019 VS 50% in 2020
 	Facebook + social: 60% in 2019 VS 40% in 2020
 	Email traffic: 10% in 2019 VS 10% in 2020

Any trend we should catch on before everyone does?
If you are waiting for the trend, you are probably already too late. Nowadays, affiliates being successful are the ones setting the trend, not the ones waiting for it! 
Overall, it means that you need to be creative. Do not look for someone else to provide you a clickbait sentence, an ad copy or a prelander. Instead, think and be the one creating the right sentence to catch the user’s attention.

7892,Starting Affiliate Program for eCommerce,"The affiliate program can become the number one driver to your sales while running an eCommerce business. Imagine having a huge marketing department, but fully outsourced and independent. You don't need to control them, all you need is — to track performance and evaluate your ROAS. If you still didn’t start an affiliate program, this is a guide for you! 
The benefits of running an affiliate program for eCommerce business are:

 	You pay only for results thanks to the commissions model as a reward. Therefore you have to pay affiliates only if they brought sales to your store. 
 	Affiliate programs allow almost limitless growth and scale for eCommerce, almost like no other type of marketing &amp; advertising could do. The more affiliates you involve — the more customers you are gonna get if you do everything right, ofc!
 	The results of affiliate marketing are easily trackable thanks to affiliate tracking links. Every action that is done on your store by customers can easily be led to affiliates that brought this client.

Sounds good? Let's learn the basics of a successful affiliate program for eCom!

What is an affiliate program for eCom?
Affiliate marketing is a type of promotion when you advertise your offers/products with help of affiliate marketers by offering them commissions (or other payouts) for sale. 

There are two key players in affiliate marketing: affiliates (also called publishers)  and advertisers. Advertisers own an offer (e-com products in your case) and the affiliate marketer is using all means (that are approved by the advertiser) to promote the offer for wider audiences. 
Therefore, an affiliate program is a type of marketing relationship that involves affiliates as advertisers for your products or services on a particular condition that you predefine. 

&nbsp;
The reward for the affiliates is usually a commission from the sale or other target action (e.g. sign-ups, submissions, joining the waiting list, add to carts). 
Usual affiliate commission/reward is anywhere from 5% to 20% from a sale, depending on the type and margin of the product you are selling. 
The best part is you don’t have to pay for this promotion until the sale is complete. While usually, you have to pay for marketing campaigns before you know the result, this approach saves your budget from unprofitable campaigns. 

&nbsp;
Who are affiliate marketers (publishers)? 
Basically, anyone could become a publisher from your offer. Typically affiliates drive the sales/traffic through their influence on the internet. It could be a written blog, YouTube channel, Facebook page, or any other source. 

As well it could be affiliates who drive paid ads to their affiliate landing pages and then to your store. 
Affiliate marketing models for eCommerce
The most common models for eCommerce are:

 	Sale commission — payout as a percentage of the sale that affiliate has driven. 
 	Leads commission — payout for the lead that affiliate has brought. 
 	Click commission — payout for traffic that your website received due to affiliate campaigns. 

Generally, you can find 2 types of payouts for the commissions:

 	CPA (Cost per action) — fixed sum for a target action or a purchase.

For example, if you sell a product that costs $100 and you decide to set a commission rate to 10% of the sale. Then your CPA for the affiliate would be $10 as a one-time payment. 
This model is one of the key payout types across all affiliate programs. 

 	RevShare — it is a percentage of the revenue driven by a customer, it can be a one-off payout or a RevShare for a couple of months.

For example, your affiliate attracts a customer that makes several purchases within a 6 months period. If you decide to choose RevShare as 10% of the purchase you will have to pay 10% to the affiliate from the whole amount that the customer spent within 6 months.

 
This model is more popular with subscription models but still takes place within eCom. RevShare attracts the attention of affiliates as it is a more promising reward. 

No doubt, the most popular model is the Sales Commission as it’s the most important metric for eCommerce business. However, you can consider other models if you have different goals at a certain point in the development of your business. 
Most popular eCommerce affiliate programs
&nbsp;

 	Amazon Associates 
Amazon is one of the most successful examples of affiliate marketing sales. Their affiliate program generates around 40% of the revenue for the company. They use the sale commission as a payment model (CPA). It’s super easy to sign up for their affiliate program for anyone, but that was truly one of the triggers for the extreme growth of the company. 

&nbsp;

 	
Fiverr Affiliates 
One of the biggest marketplaces of freelancers and professionals. At the moment 5 of Fiverr products are available for advertising with affiliates. They use different payment models to attract more affiliates and show a good example of the competitiveness of the market. Fiverr uses both CPA (like a regular sales commission of $15-$150) and a RevShare (with 10% of the Revenue for 12 months period). This model attracts more high-end affiliates (e.g. bloggers) as the earning can be pretty high.

&nbsp;

 	
Shopify Affiliate Program 
As one of the main platforms for eCommerce, Shopify successfully implements its affiliate program. For each sign-up to a paid plan on average Shopify pays out around $60 to the affiliate marketers. Therefore, it is another example of the CPA model which s extremely popular for affiliate programs. 


Tips for creating an affiliate program for eСommerce
If you are just starting and you don’t have enough of the budget for marketing campaigns, affiliate marketing for sure can become a trigger for your growth. But here are a few steps we recommend taking before diving into affiliate program creation. 
1. Choose your payments model
The commissions you are going to pay are probably one of the most important things for your affiliate program. There is huge competition on the market for eCom affiliate programs and you have to fight for publishers’ attention. If the commission is too low no affiliate will want to work with your business.
Try to analyze your business margin and that shall help you evaluate what percentage of the sale you can give away to your fellow publishers. 
Doing competitive research can help you establish the right payment model. Look what others in your or adjoining industries are doing and find the right strategy for your rewards to stand out.  
2. Choose advertising conditions wisely 
Before you set up the affiliate program you have to choose conditions for publishers. It’s not only about the type of payouts they are going to receive, but also about the means they can use to achieve results. 

Look at the following conditions to describe in your affiliate program: 

 	Qualified type of traffic affiliate can run (paid ads, push, pop, blog posts, videos, etc.)
 	Qualified countries (for customers)
 	Qualified traffic sources 
 	Qualified OS (Windows or iOS)
 	Different payouts for different sets of actions
 	Qualified creatives for usage
With the last point, you might find a great idea to create custom creatives for your brand that affiliates can use. It will help to keep a consistent brand image and avoid situations when affiliates use creatives that you would never approve of. 

3. Affiliate tracking &amp; management as a must
Probably one of the most important steps is analysis, optimization, and control, or simply called affiliate tracking &amp; management. All of that can be performed with ad tracking solutions. 


When running an affiliate program you will need to issue special links to your affiliates to understand that the conversion happened from their influence. Each affiliate receives a unique link and when users follow the link and make a purchase — you need to somehow withdraw the data about the conversion.




Affiliate tracking solutions can help resolve any disputes arising (spoiler: affiliates can cheat) and keep the relationship transparent as the tracker keeps data about all the clicks, conversions, and other actions in a single dashboard.

Another solution that is offered by some trackers is a branded panel to run and manage your own affiliate program. The white-label panel helps publish your offer, state all the conditions that you set for the affiliate program, offer different types of payouts for different affiliates and attach creatives of your choice for the campaigns.

That’s what we help doing at RedTrack. RedTrack's Publisher panel offers you a white-label program to control the performance of your affiliates and their influence on your sales and ROI.  Have all your marketing &amp; advertising activities across all channels and their results available in a single interface.

You will be able to define the most profitable channels, optimize ad spend, and analyze the conversion attribution of the funnels you create. 


4. Set your KPIs and adjust the strategy
Before you start an affiliate program, set the KPIs you want to achieve with it. Do you want more traffic? More sales? Or maybe increased brand awareness? 

Each of the KPIs requires different strategies with publishers. Different conditions for cooperation should be set and therefore different payment models have to be used.
If you don’t meet your KPIs quickly, adjust and transform your affiliate program to meet the results you wish for.  
5. Pay attention to the СLV (customer lifetime value) and retention rates
When you invest in affiliate marketing, you have to understand that your goal is not attracting one-off customers. Your goal is to make them stay with you. The longer the customer will continue purchasing from you, the better will be the ROAS for you. Therefore you will be able to offer bigger payouts to affiliates, become more competitive in the field of eCom affiliate programs and attract even more customers. This is really a snowball effect. 

It’s your duty to give customer experience people will remember and will keep coming back to. Create funnels and experiences that help a customer stay with you. It will double the influence of the affiliate program you are starting to run.
6. Take control of the ROAS of the affiliate program
It is very important to keep track of the numbers in any marketing campaign. Even though affiliate programs can be way more cost-efficient than any other marketing, it would still be of help to understand the math behind your sales. 
What is a good ROAS? Good question, but unfortunately there is no right answer to that. It depends on profitability and the margin of your product. 
The standard for eCommerce could be considered a 4:1 ROAS ratio. This means that for every $4 of revenue there is $1 of ad spend. 

When you calculate your ROAS, take into consideration all the marketing channels you utilize, not only the affiliate campaigns. This way you will be able to optimize your ad spend and direct it only to valuable resources. You can do those complex analytics with the help of an ad tracker. If you never used such a solution before, consider trying the 14-day trial period to define the worth of your business. 
Conclusion
We believe that if eCom stores are still not utilizing the potential from affiliate programs — they’re missing out. No matter all the tricks you may face while learning how to manage your affiliates properly, it’s worth the growth you can gain. Remember to always keep track of the numbers and analyze the performance of each affiliate. Ignite your brand with the best affiliate marketers available⚡️

7925,Death of third-party cookies. What experts say?,"They have been threatening us with a cookieless future for quite a while now. Not many believed at first, but here we are: standing on the porch and not ready to move out from the house where we all grew up. Cross-site tracking, digital fingerprinting, good-old targeting, pixels, and third-party cookies are behind us. But what still awaits?

We must move on from the past by 2022 as it’s the year when Google promises to eliminate third-party cookies. How do we do that with the most benefit for our businesses?

Let’s learn in this article along with experts at Admitad, FraudScore, Admixer, MaxBounty, and last but not least RedTrack (I know that’s us, but we are still honored to share our view)! 
Cookieless changes in advertising 
Pretty much every single company (willingly or not) on the market either has eliminated or is on the edge of third-party cookies' death. And we are talking about giants like Google, Apple, Facebook who play a vital role in the whole ecosystem of advertising.

Let’s have an overlook of the timeline of all the Privacy Updates introduced by major companies in recent years: 



Here we see that Google is closing the round of cookieless updates. By 2022 we will appear in a new reality. 
So are cookies dying? 
It’s worth remembering that not all cookies are dying. Only the most 'unhealthy' options out there on the internet — third-party cookies. 

Third-party cookies are little pieces of code that are stuck to your browser. Third-party cookies are responsible for transmitting your data (even personal) to third-party entities and for targeted ads that sometimes feel overwhelming.

If you are better with audio and visual content, make sure to check out our YouTube video about cookies and Privacy Updates ❤️


Is targeting and remarketing dying? 
Targeting the way we used to do it is truly dying. However, advertising depends on it. Google is working on a bunch of new protocols and APIs that will create an ability to maintain targeting and remarketing. 

It will be an interest-based “healthy” option for targeting &amp; remarketing where users' interests are considered within a group. If you want to learn more about 5 APIs introduced by Google by 2022 be sure to read this article: Google Privacy Sandbox: Approaching Cookieless Future in 2021. 
Ad Tech experts explaining cookieless future
We know a lot of theories by now about the world without cookies, but you probably still didn't figure out which strategy is the best. Therefore, we decided that the best way is to ask advertising industry experts for advice and maybe a little sneak pic of their strategy for cookieless future. 

We asked various players of the AdTech industry like affiliate networks, spy &amp; tracking tools, DSPs to give their comments about the future that awaits. Companies as Admitad, Fraudscore, Admixer, MaxBounty, and RedTrack (yeah, that’s us 😉) two main things: 

1. How the market will change after all the cookieless implementations? 

2. To share a sneak pic of their strategy after third-party cookies will die.

&nbsp;
CPA NETWORKS WILL HAVE NO OTHER WAY BUT TO UPDATE THEIR TRACKING


&nbsp;

Mozilla Firefox and Safari already announced their plans to protect user cookies from third-party tracking, however they were responsible for a relatively small share of the market. With Google Chrome joining them, CPA-networks will have no other way but to update their tracking, if they haven’t done it yet.
Anna Gidirim
Head of Russian Department of Admitad Affiliate Network 

These restrictions will only hit companies that use third-party cookies to store сlick IDs. To prepare for the changes to come, they will have to modify their tools to keep track of customers. 
What is Admitad Strategy?
Admitad hasn’t used third-party cookies for a few years by now, so publishers and advertisers won’t suffer any losses due to the Google update. Apart from the first-party cookies, they use other means of data storage — cookieless tracking and storing click ID’s on the advertisers’ server.

Admitad is doing its best to keep a hand on the trends and be ahead of the curve, so the tracking solutions are designed to last, and they always aim to improve them. Recently, they released Admitad Teleport — the new tool for publishers to replace redirect tracking in its current form. 
Publishers who channel traffic from their sites or browser extensions can now bring customers directly to the advertiser’s store, without affiliate redirects. This is how we will be able to give credit for even more orders. According to our estimates, introducing the tool can help publishers improve their current conversion rates roughly by 10% — the very 10% of orders that used to get blocked. Teleport has already been tested by our partners, so we can be sure about its efficiency. A blog about video games, for instance, boosted its monthly CR from 3% to 6,5%. Another publisher — a coupon site — started receiving some extra 270 orders per 100k clicks after it installed the Teleport API.

This is why we believe our tracking solutions are more than enough to align businesses with the changes and to protect our partners from the potential threats having to do with browser policies.
SEEMS LIKE THE WALLS OF THE WALLED GARDEN HAS GROWN HIGHER FOR THE INDUSTRY
Ad agencies are the ones that must 

deal with new Google’s rules and get prepared the most. Trackers use cookies to learn more about each user. In a world without cookies trackers need to adapt to deliver effective targeting, as they are used to do now, with cookies.

in general, it seems that Google’s decision to implement these measures is, somehow, logical. As the whole industry is claiming to fight for a more transparent and secure world for users, one can say that Google’s intentions are understandable. But to be honest, for now, it seems that the walls of this walled garden have grown higher for the industry. As Google, on the one hand, keeps postponing those changes, but, on the other hand, doesn’t give enough information on how “the new cookie-less world” will exist, what rules will be applied, and how agencies and advertisers can research more about those changes.
Dmitry Isakov
CEO AT FraudScore


What is FraudScore's strategy?
To cut the long story short, FraudScore’s fraud detection will not be affected by these measures. Their algorithms are based on processing another data type for conversions analysis and they do not use third-party cookies in traffic evaluations at all. Of course, FraudScore will be waiting for the situation to unravel to understand more about how trackers will deal with Google’s policies. But for now, Dmitry can say for sure that FraudScore’s fraud detection has never used third-party cookies for traffic check-ups, hence their solution is not under the pressure of upcoming updates from Google.
It is also fair to say that in these circumstances when the goal of delivering ads to the target audience becomes more crucial and complex, it seems that an anti-fraud solution, like ours, becomes a must-have and not just an optional tool for advertisers. It will probably become harder to reach the right target users, so the expenses will increase. In this case, making sure that all the users are real becomes vital.
A POTENTIAL SOLUTION CAN BECOME A SINGLE-SIGN ON (SSO)


When 3rd-party cookies are phased out, it will be impossible to cross the audience between sites without additional technology. The potential solution for this nearly-anonymous web can become a single-sign on (SSO) solution with a privacy-compliant ad ID. 

Potential common ID solutions include Unified ID 2.0 by TradeDesk, which is already getting mainstream adoption among US industry players; ID5, backed primarily by UK publishers, and Net ID adopted by the consortium of German publishers and media agencies. Most of these technologies still rely on 3rd-party cookies, so the future of the solution may be questionable.

Also, identity solutions require an agreement between a large number of publishers, ID vendors can provide fragmented audiences and limited inventory in certain niches if providers choose to build a closed ecosystem with limited interoperability. It is highly unlikely that the market will get behind a single identity provider, rather it will establish a common framework built on principles of the IAB initiative project Rearc.
Yaroslav Kholod
Director of Programmatic Operations at Admixer

What is Admixer strategy?
It is a system of logging users on sites and in mobile apps using emails/phones (saved in a hashed format) that allows them to accurately target users without compromising their identity. The upcoming SSO solution will also seamlessly integrate with other identity solutions through an API (Unified IDs/Telecom/Measurement partners and verifiers),

Admixer SSP aspires to create an effective advertising ID for Eastern European media owners, leveraging our relationships with agencies, local premium publishers, and advertising networks in Belarus, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan that work on our technology. 
The solution will be interoperable with the major identity providers and allow web advertisers to conduct cross-site campaigns, measure and verify reach without compromising user identity. Admixer ID will add value to web inventory and make it competitive with data-rich Walled Gardens.
AFFILIATE MARKETING CAN BECOME A MORE VIABLE OPTION FOR CERTAIN ADVERTISERS


The entire affiliate marketing industry has always had to quickly adapt to changes from large tech companies like Google, Facebook, and Apple. This has been the case for our network and our affiliates since MaxBounty was launched 17 years ago. The benefit to this is affiliates have become proficient at quickly transitioning their campaign strategies. 

Affiliates who are currently utilizing re-targeting features on third-party platforms may end up losing a traffic source. Although that’s unfortunate, we’re confident that they will be able to pivot their strategy. 

Alternatively, we’ve also witnessed in the past changes to the general online landscape actually benefiting affiliate marketing. If the removal of cookies on Chrome were to negatively impact traditional digital advertising, affiliate marketing could become a more viable option for certain advertisers.  
Matt McEvoy 
CEO At Maxbounty 

What is MaxBounty strategy
MaxBounty copes with changes by continuously tweaking the network’s proprietary tech. For instance, a while ago they shifted their own tracking away from cookies. It’s now primarily based on server calls which negate any sweeping changes to browser or phone OS technology. This ensured the network wasn’t negatively affected when Apple gave their users the ability to opt-out of apps that track their online history and behavior. 

Once Chrome makes the full transition away from cookies to FLoC, MaxBounty will closely monitor its impact on our business. We’ll then use that information to make any potential changes that we feel are necessary at that time. 

Matt from MaxBounty believes it’s important for affiliates to be aware of this upcoming change and its potential impact. He always recommended that everyone is better to prepare themselves for the current campaign strategy one day becoming less effective. That’s accomplished by applying their technique to other avenues, whether that be a different campaign vertical, traffic source, or target audience. 
We’ll make sure we do our part on educating people on Google’s planned transition and how they can prepare moving forward. 
DATA IS A FUEL BEHIND MARKETING &amp; ADVERTISING AND WE WILL SEE A SHIFT TO FIRST-PARTY DATA SOURCES 


A lot of things will change. And that will cover multiple areas important to digital marketers. from something that everyone used to: from audience targeting &amp; remarketing to attribution. Definitely there will be a lot of changes. However the key one will relate to data sources.  Data is the fuel behind marketing and advertising and we will see a shift from 3rd party to 1st party data sources.
Vlad Zhovtenko
 CEO at RedTrack


 	The big winners will be publishers, either with large coverage or niche content. Their first-party data will now become unobtainable without their permission.
 	Ad tech companies who will find a way to leverage that first-party data for targeting &amp; remarketing will emerge as adapted winners. And of course, Google and Facebook will benefit as they are the biggest holders of first-party data between all their products.
 	Tracking and attribution will switch to first-party data, making implementation a bit more complex and cutting the ability of those companies for additional monetization.
 	Fraud detection will be the only industry that will not change as it does not rely on cross-site tracking.

What is RedTrack's strategy
At RedTrack.io we cope with consequences less now, as we stopped relying on third-party cookies ever since Safari announced the switch. We started preparing solutions back then in 2017 and 2018 to make sure we will be well-equipped for cookieless future. 
However, the biggest challenge is created by other tools used by RedTrack's customers that adapt to the market and force us to adapt fast. A recent example is almost “instant”  (in terms of technology impact) switch in Facebook tracking and attribution. A lot of affiliate marketers were not able to continue running their campaigns in a usual way. Therefore, thanks to users' requests and needs we were able to improve the product by implementing Native Facebook CAPI implementation.
In a nutshell, RedTrack strategy now is to focus on customer needs and continue development in the direction where market points. 
RedTrack as a cookieless solution
As mentioned above by our CEO, RedTrack stopped relying on third-party cookies back a few years ago when the market started showing the signs. 

By now we are fully equipped with S2S (server to server) Postback technology which serves as a first-party data tracking system and does not depend on changes introduced by  Google, Apple, or Facebook. 

Moreover, to deal with the most recent problem of Facebook CAPI we developed a Native Facebook Conversion API Solution for advertisers dealing with the whole setup. Besides, we made an out-of-the-box solution for affiliate marketers to verify affiliate landing pages (third-party domains) in order to continue advertising with Facebook Ads. You can learn more about Facebook CAPI in this article — How Facebook CAPI changes your advertising. 


Conclusion
Digital marketers always had to adapt. So we have to do it one more time. This time the change feels more fundamental. Cookies, targeting, and remarketing always was a simple thing to hold on to. However, we recommend you follow the advice that our partners from the ad tech industry in the article above mentioned. It might be not easy, but your ROAS will be grateful for you to take a step in a new direction. Have a safe &amp; sound ad tracking ⚡️

7980,2021 Push Traffic Overview: Full Guide From RichAds,"2021 prepared lots of challenges for affiliate marketers who work with push traffic all over the world. Last year, Google Chrome launched new updates that promised to block both offers for subscriptions and push subscriptions bases. That’s why this year, marketers should analyze traffic sources before launching a campaign. Today, our partners from the RichAds ad platform will share insights on running push traffic campaigns and making a profit with Push Traffic Guide for 2021. Find in the guide: niches, blacklists, targeting options, costs, converting examples, and more.
The best niches for push traffic
The audience that subscribes to push notification ads is quite diverse, so they perform well for quite a lot of verticals. The most important thing is that offers should be interesting for customers with a wide range of interests. 

According to our statistics, the following verticals will perform great with push ads:

 	VPN Subscriptions
 	Mobile
 	Betting
 	Gambling
 	Dating
 	Games
 	Finance
 	Sweepstakes
 	Binary options
 	E-commerce
 	Nutra


What is the cost of push traffic?
Push traffic is relatively cheap if compared to other traffic types, for example, Facebook. If you want to start your way in affiliate marketing, we recommend testing push traffic. 

You buy it according to the CPC model, where you pay for clicks only. In RichAds, the cost per click starts from $0.003 and varies according to the Tier of your GEO. For example, the minimum average CPC in India is $0.02992. In the USA, this value increases to $0.34608. 



“Don’t forget to limit the number of clicks per day (it will help not to waste budget on useless clicks). The 2nd click more often leads to targeted action than the first one. After the 3rd click, the conversion decreases significantly. 2 clicks per day is a perfect option for making a profit”.

Eugene Kuznetsov, RichAds Product Manager 



Also, pay attention to the bid you choose. Aim for the average recommended bid for your GEO and setup as the ad network offers in the interface. Those who set up the highest bid become the bidding leader and get priority for showing their ad, but you can waste all your budget for a short period of time. Also, don’t set up a very low bid, as in this case, there is a risk that you will not get traffic at all. 


How to make Blacklists for push ads?
First of all, to make optimization it’s necessary to set up conversion tracking and ensure if it works properly. We recommend turning to your account manager not to lose money.

You can blacklist non-converting sources in RichAds, using our auto-optimization feature called Automated Rules, without wasting your time. 

For that, we have special ready-made presets, for example, you can Blacklist Expensive Publishers or Blacklist Non-converting Subscribers List

This feature will help you save time, scale effectively, do ROI optimization, optimize micro-conversions, and import your media buying strategies from other platforms. 



&nbsp;
Let’s see the insights from Yan Gorbach,
Head of Customer Success at RichAds
&nbsp;

 	Make optimization according to CTR. Exclude sources with too high CTR as it's credible proof of bot traffic.
 	Optimize according to the landing page CTR excluding landing pages with too low CTR. The logic here is the same as in the previous point, but one step ahead. Clicks but no visits? We can make a conclusion about bot traffic.
 	The number of conversions is also a nice indicator for optimization. Exclude sources that wasted 2-3 conversions price and didn’t show any results.
 	Also, you can optimize on EPC. Blacklist sources where the profit from the click is less than its price.
 	If the advertiser knows the bounce rate, you can optimize on this data. Block sources that have the highest rejection rates.

What about Chrome restrictions?
Each year push traffic faces new and new difficulties, and 2021 is no different. There are risks of increased competition and market regulations, but all traffic sources are currently creating new kinds of push formats with new audiences and increased CR.



Despite 2020 Google Chrome’s threats, push notifications are still alive and perform usefully. Moreover, two new converting formats appeared at RichAds: In-page push and Calendar push formats. 

Let us tell you a bit more about Calendar push format. These notifications are similar to scheduled events on iOS and macOS devices. 

What the format gives you:

 	High-quality traffic (the users of Apple devices are solvent).
 	High CR (premium sources, new untapped audience).
 	High visibility (ads are delivered even to the locked devices).
 	No images needed (just think of the title and text).


Let’s dwell on the targeting options
It may be hard to segment the audience on push ads by interest or demographics as users don’t leave their private data while subscribing. Push targeting options are less diverse (compared with social traffic), but they also allow segmenting audiences according to your client’s profile. 

Moreover, you can use the golden opportunity some networks have - to target different subscriber quality levels according to their CR (Premium, Standard, or Remnant). In RichAds, we also have the New Subscribers Only function that allows showing ads to new users only. 

The most popular targeting options on push traffic are Country, OS, Browser, and devices. For example, OS targeting allows you to target the latest versions only which helps to save your budget.



“Localize creatives according to the country of your geo. Use language, elements in the images, and other tricks to add one more targeting option”.

Eugene Kuznetsov, RichAds Product Manager 



Push creatives: how to and how not to?
Strategy 1: Upload a few creatives to improve CTR
We always recommend uploading 3-5 (up to 10) creatives in one campaign. It’s a key to quality tests (and don’t be confused by the fact that the creatives will compete with each other). Very often, only one creative of the whole pack converts best. Why should you waste your budget on non-performing options?
Strategy 2: Make creatives for special occasions
People are always eager to get prizes and gifts with huge discounts. That’s why we recommend being especially active during Black Friday, New Year, Christmas, and other holidays. Customize your creatives and get lots of conversions.
Strategy 3: Limit impressions and boost CTR
Multiple impressions per day may be too intrusive and play against your profit. That’s why we recommend not forgetting about the impressions limit. RichAds experts say that campaigns with 2 impressions per day show the best performance. The higher the score, the lower the success of the campaign.
Strategy 4: Update creatives timely
All creatives tend to burn out as people become bored of the same creatives. The solution is easy: update creatives regularly (at least once a week).

Also, we prepared a few examples of well and poor-performing creatives. 

 	Use clear images and don’t place many elements in the image. Try to avoid lots of phrases not to mislead users.

 	Use before/after images of real people to improve CTR. This trick works with nutra in 99% of cases. Don’t use Photoshop and professional photos while preparing the main images.


 	Use the AIDA rule for creating text for the creative.
A = Attention 
I = Interest 
D = Desire 
A = ActionTry to generate interest and desire.




 	Use localization tricks for the creatives. You can use the icons of famous messengers. For example, in Canada, Facebook is more popular than WhatsApp.


 	Emojis increase CTR significantly. Using them is a golden rule for making converting creatives. But remember about the sense of proportion: don’t use too many emotions at once. But this advice is very situational, as in some cases, creatives without emojis may work better.


Creating a list of push subscribers
Collecting push subscribers is a nice option for professionals who want to scale and make even more profit on a successful campaign.

There are 2 ways of how you can do it:

 	Collect push subscribers and create your own list.
 	Collecting subscribers via special scripts offered by special networks.

If you work with special affiliate programs, you should know that usually they offer 2 formats of cooperation:

 	CPL model (where you pay for subscription one time and the payment depends on the country you work with). You buy cheaper, sell expensive and earn on the margin.
 	RevShare model (you get a percentage of the sale of your subscriptions). This model is for more long-term cooperation as you get the payout within 1-2 months).

Any of the ways above may help you make some extra money to pay for additional instruments like spy tools, forums, trackers, or other services. 

Join RichAds platform, launch and optimize push campaigns with professional experts from the industry!

Conversion Tracking for Push Traffic 
Having an ad tracker while running push traffic ads is not a nice bonus, but a necessity. Here are the few features that you will need to keep your performance at the top:

 	conversion tracking for a deeper understanding of campaign performance 
 	automation &amp; rules that will help you let go of the controls of your campaigns 
 	reporting features to find any conversion discrepancies between affiliates, publishers, and advertisers

You will find these and many other features embedded in RedTrack — SaaS solution for conversion tracking &amp; attribution chosen by affiliates &amp; advertisers around the globe.

8017,How to advertise on Reddit: Complete Guide 2022,"Even though there are many channels that we used for digital marketing, there are still platforms we might miss out on the opportunity. Reddit is the 7th most popular social network in the States that can generate a lot of traffic and sales to your product. However, you need to know which mistakes to avoid not to mess up with advertising on Reddit and for your investment (whether it is a budget or your time) to pay off. 
This piece will give you a complete immersion in what Reddit is, how to build community on Reddit and how to advertise successfully via content marketing or paid Reddit Ads. Follow along! 
What is Reddit? 
Reddit is basically a massive collection of forums gathered under one roof where people discuss anything from bird photos to startup topics. 

You can post your content, communicate with other members and discuss issues on Reddit. It works like a digital space for arguments, discussions, and sharing of knowledge.



That’s what makes it great — you can find any topic you like or your product fits and you may have access to the audience gathered in one place who are into the same thing. 
What is a subreddit? 
A subreddit is a unit that is equal to the forum. As we said before, Reddit is a collection of forums. So eventually it consists of “subreddits” — forums covering a specific topic on Reddit. 
Each subreddit is defined with r/ which is a part of Reddit’s URL. For instance, r/entrepreneur is a forum dedicated to entrepreneurship posts. 

In the picture below, we can see r/FacebookAds which gathers 12k people who are interested in solutions connected to Fb Ads.



To find communities (subreddits) you would like to follow, use the search bar at the top of the page. Once you joined a couple of subreddits you might find the bar with “Best”, “Hot”, “New”, and “Top” filtering options useful. Each button will help to filter out the new posts in subreddits according to their name. But it works only for communities or subreddits you follow. 
Guidelines &amp; Community of Reddit
This is a very important thing to take into consideration before starting any activity of Reddit. This platform is known for increased trustworthiness and humanity in the times of digital spaces. Reddit tries to recreate the IRL community feeling while using all the digital technologies. It is about creating valuable communities and commenting out with respect, knowledge, and tact. No matter if we are talking about cat pics subreddits or politics discussions. 



People appreciate real content, real opinion and get upset with useless promotions. You have to deliver value if you want to attract attention to your brand or your content. 



You can see the guidelines on posting on Reddit below. As well you might notice that each community has its own rules that are set by mods (moderators). 
Posting to Reddit rules: 

 	Remember the human
 	Behave like you would in real life
 	Look for the original source of content
 	Search for duplicates before posting
 	Read the community rules

Read more community Rules here and make sure to check out the Reddiquette. 
Reddit language 
And yes, Reddit absolutely loves creating its own language. Few of the abbreviations you might wanna get accustomed to before diving into Reddit: 

Mods (moderators) — volunteers who moderate the content in the subreddits: they can change the look of the subreddit, remove content or sometimes even ban certain users. Though do not mistake mods with admins (who are official employees on Reddit) who have even more power over the content you post and who can take away mods’ right to influence subreddits. 

OP (original poster) — refers to a person who originally created a certain post. A well-respected human!

TIL (Today I Learned) — sometimes posts on Reddit can be as easy as TIL. People share their experience or knowledge of the certain areas. And this content works pretty well. 

AMA (also IAmA) — refers to the “Ask me anything” thread. It is a type of Q&amp;A where people can type any question they want to be answered. 

TL;DR (Too long; didn’t read) — we all know what that means. Strive for engaging content for TL;DR to not happen with you :)

Upvote — a positive vote that users can do to a post in a subreddit to indicate that this post is bringing value to the community. 

Downvote — a negative vote that users show to bring your post down in the subreddit tops. That means that your post is not engaging, not bringing value, or is against the guidelines of Reddit. 

Karma — that’s a measurement of the quality of your content and profile on Reddit. There are two types of Karma on Reddit: post karma and comment karma. As you remember, Reddit wants you to remember that even if you are in a digital space, you have to remember to stay human and as IRL (in real life). So take care of your digital karma. 
Why advertise on Reddit? 
The real power of Reddit is in communities of engaged people who share the same interests in particular subreddits. Therefore, once you find a way to subreddit top and Redditors’ hearts — you are on the right way to receive a lot of inexpensive attention. 

For example, these are the results some companies managed to achieve with Reddit Ads: 

Accuweather decreased CPI by 67%, tripled the CR rate, and increased sessions per install by 115%. 



Tushy (a bidet brand) has gained 450% ROAS (Return on Ad Spend), got 49% higher CTR, and leveraged 300% lower CPC. 



 
You may choose advertising strategies up to your budget by choosing one of the three available types of ads on Reddit: 


1) Content Marketing — the infamous method which is low at its cost, but takes more time and other resources. 

2) Reddit Paid Ads — this is the same technique as Facebook Ads but on Reddit :) You can set the budget, the bid, and test advertising through interest-based communities.

3) Ad Units by Reddit — this is sort of exclusive advertising which is held through the Reddit team. You can buy out your ad placements on the auction. And this is the most expensive option to go for.

Let’s reveal each of the methods in the following complete guide. 
Complete guide: how to advertise on Reddit 
Before we dig into this guide, we have to define once again that there are three types of advertisement on Reddit: Paid Reddit Ads, Ad units available on auction, and Content Marketing on Reddit. 
How to advertise via content marketing strategy on Reddit

 	Create an account and research the audience

The first rule of Reddit: before you start advertising, it’s better to create trust around your profile. If you want to blend in with the society of Redditors, you have to play the game by its rules. Research your target audience, see what people post in subreddits, enjoy the ride :)

 	Earn the trust of the community 

Don’t start posting marketing content straight from a fresh profile. First things first you want to get accustomed to a platform. Interact with Redditors, try posting general content to a few of the subreddits you might need in the future, and comment on other people's posts. 

You need to earn some karma before you start promotions. The better karma you have, the better chances that your posts will be displayed higher in the subreddits. 
Questions on subreddits are known as one of the most traffic-generating threads. Consider asking your community a few questions that might even help you in the future with your business. 

 	Start slipping in marketing content upfront 

After you’ve been known in the community as a contributor, you can start spilling promotional posts. Just keep in mind that Redditors do not like shady marketing schemes. If you have something to say, just say it! Promote it!



Simply consider putting the value before the promotion. Each marketing action has to be tied to the benefits that readers will get from it. 

 	Post consistent &amp; authentic content 

Even if you do promotional posts, do not forget about the community. Post threads with valuable content on a regular basis. As with any social media, consistency is the key. 


Here are a few rules you want to use for your posts on subreddits: 

 	Instant value (with no weird marketing schemes)
 	Relevant content to the subreddit
 	No clickbait titles
 	Use informative titles that showcase the value 
 	Cover hot topics/concerns/trends and look for opinions 
 	Once gained some reputation, host AMA 

Remember Ask me anything thread? Well, by this moment you are a PRO Redditor, so we think you are ready to step up the game and host your AMA. Use other social media to bring attention to your AMA and try to get as many questions as possible. It is a very good way to generate users’ attention. Consider setting an agenda that would help users ask questions relevant to what you need to advertise. 

 	Curate the content that people will contribute to themselves

One of the best social media phenomena is user-generated content. Some brands can easily trigger wider audiences to co-create content with them. It is known to be the cheapest way of marketing since you barely need any resources. 

A great example is Spotify. They simply asked users a question: to mention songs and feelings/emotions tied to these songs in order to create a playlist. It turned out to be a playlist of 10,000 songs which basically can be equated to the amount of attention that Spotify got during this thread going viral. 
It showcases once again that sometimes you don’t need big budgets, you just need to be creative and understand the human psyche


 	Running a contest 

Well, this is not an easy way to market yourself because there are many things that can go wrong. We all know how shady sometimes content on the web looks like. And keeping in mind how picky Redditors are, it is probably even harder to host good content on Reddit. 
However, remember the rules we discussed many times already: stay human and bring value. Think about the emotion that you want to cause when choosing a strategy for a contest. 

A great example of successful content is Nissan. They asked a simple question: “What is one thing you want from Amazon?”. The thread went viral and Nissan treated the most unique commentators with the things they wanted on Amazon along with a Reddit Gold subscription. 

Sometimes even simple things can make people happy ;) 
Paid advertising on Reddit
Promoted posts
The first option to go for — to run paid ads. If you used Facebook Ads before, you know the drill. Except for the fact that setup on Reddit is way easier. 

 	Create an ad account for the company

 	Find your target audience in subreddits and check activity

Before you start advertising, you have to do your research. Start by diving into the topics that might be interesting to your consumer. Define at least 5 to 10 subreddits that could fit your TA. Learn what people post there, how they communicate, become a contributor yourself. Before you advertise on Reddit, you really have to learn about your audience.                                 

 	Create a campaign

After you’ve done the research you can proceed to create an advertising campaign on the main page. One of the first steps you will have to complete: choose an objective for your ads. If you tried Facebook Ads before, you already know what to do. Make sure to choose the objective according to the needs of your marketing strategy.



 	Create an ad group

The hierarchy of the campaign on Reddit is the following: Campaign — Ad Group — Ad. This structure helps groups your ads in ag groups and in campaigns.
When creating an ad group, you narrow down the audience you want to use for targeting your ads. You can also choose interests, add communities, choose device type for targeting. In the ad group, you have to set the budget and a bit for your ad.



 	Create a fascinating ad

The next step is to create your ad. You will have an opportunity to use existed post or to create a new one for your ad creative. You may choose the type of your creative from Video, Text, and Link. Access by the needs you have which type would work better for you.



 	Wait for approval

After you created an ad you will have to submit it for approval. Usually, it takes about 24-48 hours for your ad to get approved. And once your ad is live — you will receive an email notification. 

 	Analyze results and optimize strategy

As in every digital marketing activity, analytics is the key to success. Sometimes performance statistics can not show the numbers we expect to see, but we need to use this data to improve and get higher results in the future. 
One of the best tools that you might use for analytics is an ad tracker. It allows you to track the performance of your ads (on all advertising channels) in a single dashboard and make conclusions for optimization. 

At RedTrack, we are focused on delivering the top-notch solution for conversion tracking &amp; attribution. In a single tool you receive the following functionality: 

 	Bird-eye view of all your digital marketing &amp; advertising activities at all channels (including affiliates, PPC, Organic, etc.)
 	In-depth granular analytics &amp; reporting to understand every single bit of conversions
 	Conversion attribution to analyze the users’ actions in complex funnels
 	Seamless integration and automation of 20+ traffic sources for easy control of your ads


Ad auction on Reddit
Another way to run paid ads with Reddit is by using an ad unit. Reddit offers a bunch of exclusive display ads for placements on communities on an auction basis for a fixed CPM. In order to use this type of advertising, you must work directly with the Reddit team. 
A few ad units that Reddit offers: 

 	Promoted post &amp; video ad units (sort of Native Ads on Reddit)
 	Takeover Ad unites (you get a chance to be at the top of the communities you are interested in for 24 hours)
 	First View unit (be the first to be seen on the Home or Popular page)

This option is more expensive and the prices are not announced publicly on the website. So before you consider participating in an ad auction, consider trying content marketing on Reddit or simple Paid Ads. 
So is Reddit advertising for you? 
A lot of advertisers dump Reddit before then finishing typing Reddit.com. There is a reason for that, Reddit is known to be a hard platform to win its heart. But with complicated turns come amazing rewards. 
If you choose to stick with advertising on Reddit, you get access to highly engaged communities that do not scroll but read the content. You might grab the attention of Redditors and co-create the content with their help as well as stumble upon discoveries you would not find on another platform. 
And last but not least, while many advertisers are afraid of opening Reddit, you get the cut in the competition. So take your chance while you have it. Enjoy advertising on Reddit with this step-by-step guide.

8056,How to calculate and improve marketing ROI,"Before you start scaling any marketing or advertising activity, you have to pay attention to the numbers. As marketers, it’s our responsibility to not only create fascinating concepts, articles, ads, and creatives but calculate that everything we do actually pays off. 

The best metric to use for it is marketing ROI. 
It’s a fancy word that is used by many industries, but how to use and calculate ROI in marketing? 

Without further ado, let’s investigate how to use ROI, attribute it to the right campaigns and channels, and level up your marketing. 
What is ROI in marketing?
ROI (Return on Investment) in marketing is a metric for performance measurement that takes control over how much you actually earn from your marketing efforts. 

It is crucial for any marketing budget to know exactly the return on the effort (or investment). 
What is the marketing ROI formula? 
The simplest formula that marketer can use:
(Sales revenue - Marketing Cost)/ Marketing Cost  = ROI
&nbsp;

Sales revenue — this is a total sum of the revenue was brought by sales of your product within a specific period of time. 

Marketing Cost — the total cost for all the efforts that were made by marketing department (e.g. PPC, influencer marketing, guest posting, etc.)
But how do you define Sales caused by marketing activities? 
However, the usage of the simple ROI formula can be tricky. Sales revenue may be influenced by myriads of factors as usually there are multiple types of marketing campaigns and other partnerships that might have caused a spike. 

First, we want to lose the part of the sales that were not affected by the marketing efforts.

For that we do the following procedure:
Sales revenue - Average Organic Sales Revenue = Marketing influenced Sale Revenue
Therefore, the following formula for marketing ROI is a better option: 
Marketing Influenced Sales growth - Marketing Cost
______________________________
Marketing Cost = ROI
&nbsp;
Other challenges of measuring marketing ROI
&nbsp;

Once we figured the Marketing Influenced Sales Revenue, comes another challenge. If we want to understand the return not only on the general investment that we throw in marketing campaigns, we need to evaluate the return on each campaign in order to cut the number of unprofitable ones. 

&nbsp;

Here a marketer reaches a point where you need to attribute the results of a particular campaign to the particular segment of growth. For that, we will need such a metric as Attributable Marketing ROI.

&nbsp;

Attributable Marketing ROI defines the return brought by each campaign, the return that correlates with a particular marketing activity. 

But how to calculate ROI on a campaign-specific basis? 

&nbsp;
How to calculate ROI on campaigns? 
If we have data about attributable sales, we, therefore, are able to calculate Attributable Marketing ROI. 

&nbsp;

Attributable Marketing ROI = (Attributable Sales Growth - Marketing Cost) / Marketing cost 

&nbsp;

This look at your marketing and ad spend will let you see the details behind each campaign you run to evaluate the overall contribution to the sales growth. 

&nbsp;

If we talk about digital marketing, there is a solution for digital marketers to effectively attribute the conversions/sales to a specific marketing channel/campaign and even an ad or creative. 
Digital marketers use the functionality of multi-touch conversion attribution tools to know what specific advertisement moves the sales. 

&nbsp;

At RedTrack, we offer not only a chance to consolidate all your marketing efforts in a single dashboard (like PPC, organic, affiliate links, partner marketing) for analytics but also to perform complex attribution. 

The tool helps you define which action in a user funnel triggered the target action (like a purchase), but also attributes it to the correct channel and then — campaign. 

&nbsp;

CTA

&nbsp;
Good Marketing ROI — what is it? 
Ideal marketing ROI is different from industry to industry. Basically, it depends on the type of business you do and on the margin. 

&nbsp;

A golden standard for mROI is 5:1. 

&nbsp;

If you reach this ratio, you are doing a good job with optimizing your marketing spend and return on it. However, some industries or particular campaigns can allow reach up to 10:1 ratio. 

&nbsp;



The better you use attributing features when calculating your returns on campaigns, the higher marketing ROI ratio you can aim for. 

&nbsp;
Why care about Customer Lifetime Value?
CLV stands for Customer Lifetime Value and it’s a measurement that defines how much one client has brought you in sales over the course of interaction with your company. 

For some companies, it can be months of interaction, but some manage to keep the customer returning for decades. 

CLV is crucial when talking about ROI because. It makes a difference for calculation if you have to pay to attract a customer only once or if you need to pay for each visit of his/her to your company’s website. 
The better the Customer Lifetime Value your business provides, the better marketing ROI ratio you are going to have. 


Tracking tools (ad tracking and conversion attribution) allow you to see each interaction user has had with your business digitally, shows

&nbsp;
How to improve your marketing ROI
&nbsp;

Here’s a list of recommendations that will help you achieve the best results when it comes to marketing ROI and improve your metrics: 

&nbsp;

 	Set your marketing goals and budget per activity accordingly 
 	Take control of each segment of your marketing: not only of every type of marketing you do (influencer, PPC, affiliate program), but of every campaign separately. 

This approach will help you spot the best and the worst performing campaign.

 	Use ad tracking functions that will allow you to see the performance of each ad and creative you run with in-depth metrics: like what locations, devices, or other segments work better. 

Once you have all the data about the performance of your digital marketing channels at one glance, you will be able to move to do the marketing attribution. 

 	Attribute sale growth to each campaign you run and calculate ROI by each campaign to see how much each campaign actually brings to your business. 
Focus on profitable campaigns and analyse why the worse-performing once do not deliver the value you exected. 
 	Only then calculate the overall ROI on your marketing efforts once you know the numbers behind each activity you perform. 

You will receive the end number that shows the success of all your marketing efforts in just one number.

8077,Facebook Ads vs. Google Ads: Which Is Better,"When we choose to run paid ads we face a major question: Google Ads VS Facebook Ads. Even though many companies successfully run campaigns on both sources, sometimes we want to choose which platform suits our needs best. 

When the battle of Facebook Ads VS Google Ads comes, what do you choose? Let’s dive into the most prominent characteristics of both channels and review what you can get from each of them. We will review similarities, differences and advantages of Google and Facebook advertising platforms. 
What is Google Ads
It’s a paid advertising platform created by Google that allows you to place your ads on all channels owned by Google. Until 2018 we would find it as Google Adwords. There are two types of Google Ads: banners and paid search. In this article, we are going to refer to the second type. 

Terms “Google Ads” and “Paid Search” are usually used interchangeably. 
It works on an auction basis which means that your ads are placed every time a user is typing a keyword search. The ads that companies place are “competing” to be displayed by a specific keyword according to a few parameters, like Quality Score and Bid amount.
What is Facebook Ads
Facebook Ads is probably the number one paid advertising channel on social media. When using Facebook Ads, you get a chance to place your ads on #1 Social Media (Facebook) as well as on Instagram. Facebook Ads come in many formats: promoted posts, stories, carousels, news feed, etc. 

At this point, it may seem Facebook Ads is not that different from Google Ads. Just the same paid advertising, but on a different platform? Not really. 



The approach both platforms use is radically different. What defines Facebook Ads the most is the ability to target people by their interests. That gives you a chance to find new audiences that you might not have stumbled upon before. 

Let’s find further similarities and differences in the next chapters!
Google Ads VS Facebook Ads: comparison of paid ads giants
Let's dive right into comparison of those advertising platforms.  
What is similar between Google and Facebook Ads? 
Both Facebook and Google Ads function on pay per click basis. The budgets you can start with are relatively small: starting $5-10 a day to test your campaigns and understand whether it’s something worth investing in. 

Both platforms allow you a chance for advanced targeting and retargeting. However, the approach on how they target is different. We will learn it further. 

Google Ads and Facebook Ads both own a big share of the market which means that you get a chance to advertise on different platforms and via various ad formats. 
Where you can advertise with Facebook Ads: 

 	Facebook Ads (FB News Feed, Marketplace, Video feeds, right column)
 	Instagram Ads (Feed or stories)
 	Messenger
 	Audience network

Where can you advertise with Google Ads: 

 	Google Search
 	Youtube Ads
 	Google Play
 	Display network 
 	Google shopping
 	Google maps

How do Google Ads and Facebook Ads differ?
The amount of differences between Google and Facebook Ads definitely outnumbers the similarities. Below you can find infographics which reveal most prominent differences in one picture. 


1. Paid Search VS Paid Social 
The key difference is in the fact that Facebook Ads is a paid social when Google Ads is a paid search. What does it mean in reality? 



Google Ads work perfectly if the user knows what he/she is looking for: whether it’s a product or even a specific company to purchase from.
 So Google Ads step out as a boost for the purchase, but this type of advertisement rarely introduces to customers new products/companies. 
While Facebook Ads can enrich your audiences because your ads pop up during the social media scrolling. 
Facebook Ads work better for brand awareness, attracting new users and clients that might never even thought of using your product before. 
That being said, it becomes obvious that the combination of Google Ads with Facebook Ads is kind of an ideal mix for the company. When one type of ads work for your brand awareness and reaching new audiences, another one helps users complete the purchase by choosing your company over the others.

If you choose to run both types of PPC, you have to know which channels and campaigns connected to this channel actually converts and which creates holes in your advertising budgets. For that, you might need to learn about marketing attribution. This feature helps you attribute the conversions to a particular channel - campaign - ad unit and gives you a chance for in-depth analysis of the user funnel. Attribution will step up as a performance judge when you use both Google and Facebook Ads. 

At RedTrack, we provide a multi-touch attribution solution to analyze all your media-buying activities and define converting strategies. You can start with a 14-day free trial to test what attribution can bring to your business. 
2. Audience Size
Even though both channels have an outstanding reach when it comes to available audiences, we still can compare those numbers. 

There are over 5.9 billion of searches performed daily on Google in 2021. All of those searches  become ads that serve sales. 

On the contrary, Facebook has 1.8 billion daily active users. All of these users are the potential customers that you can target for your product/offer. 

&nbsp;

3. Google VS Facebook Ads costs
When we talk about budgets that we are going to need to run successful campaigns on both platforms, we will need to understand the target industry first. 

Each niche has a different price for the performed ads, so for some industries, it makes more sense to invest in Google Ads and for some — in Facebook Ads. 

The general number for CPC (cost per click) in Facebook Ads as of April 2021 is $0.97.

If we talk about the average CPC for Google Ads, we see the number between $1 to $2 per click. And the average ROI (return on investment) at an 8:1 ratio. That means that for every $1 investment you get $8 in return. 

Learn more details on how to calculate marketing ROI.
Advantages of Google Ads 
If we sum up everything discussed above, there are the following advantages of using Google Ads over Facebook Ads. 
Google Ads work better for sales
Google Ads is perfect for users with high buyer intent. If they are googling your keyword, they are most likely to convert and actually make a purchase. Of course, if you win the auction and get your ad placed on the top of the search. 

If you want Google Ads to work for skyrocketing your sales, make sure to take care of two imporant factors.
1. Improve Quality Score for higher performing campaigns 
Quality score is metric that shows how relevant and useful the ad will be to the user.

It is a compound of relevance of your ad to the search query, relevance of the ad to the ad group, historical data fro your ads (CTR, CR), overall account performance overtime. 

The exact measurement of the Quality Score is a secret kept by Google so noone can actually figure out what could improve your performance.

Another metric to take care of is Bid amount. It is an amount you are willing to pay to attract a user. 

If you want to improve your ad positioning, you need to have higher Quality Score with the right bid amount. It is crucial to establish a high Quality Score if you want your ads to run smoothly and have lower costs per ad.
2. While running Google Ads, prepare your website to convert
Even if your ad is on the top of the search query, but the UX on your website is not leading the customer to the purchase, you are more likely to lose. 

Once the user clicks on your ad, your website has to send a definitive message to the customer that this is the product for her/him. 
Google Ads has a massive reach
Google has almost triple the Facebook audience which allows you to target more potential customers. Google is the number one place on the Internet where people go to look for answers and solutions. If your ad becomes one of the solutions to people’s problems, you have a high chance of winning. 
When running Google Ads, let your solution become the answer to the question.

Advantages of Facebook Ads 
But why would Facebook Ads work better for your needs? 
Find audiences that do not know about you
Facebook gives advertisers a unique chance for targeting and retargeting. Because of the social media experience and all the data that Facebook managed to gather around its users, they know precisely what they might need. 

Targeting by interest allows you to find new customers by creating a need that they did not need prior to stumbling upon your ad. Get creative and try testing new audiences, you never know which crowd will bring you a crazy CR. 
Use smart algorithms with Facebook Ads 
Facebook had quite a lot of time to accumulate data about its users. We will not go into details about whether it’s good or bad for us. But it’s definitely beneficial for Facebook algorithms! Facebook targeting options are famous for reaching all the users you wanted. 

Their targeting options include:

 	Location
 	Custom Audiences
 	Interests
 	Behavior 
 	Demographics
 	Lookalike audiences 

All of them work perfectly for your advertising needs, but Interests and Lookalike audiences might give you a lot of coverage within users that you didn’t think of attracting.

Increase brand awareness
This had to be the number one reason to choose Facebook Ads over Google Ads as it makes it more distinctive. While people are casually browsing their Facebook Feed, your ads may appear as natives. People may learn about new, innovative products, about something they have never heard of before while doing their day-to-day activities. 

If you want your brand name to appear within a huge crowd — Facebook Ads is the right choice for you.

However, don't forget that for proper work with Facebook Ads you will need help from Facebook CAPI.

Check out our latest video-explainer on what is Facebook CAPI and how to use it!

So what do you choose: Google or Facebook Ads? 
In this article, we covered the most prominent differences and similarities of Facebook and Google Ads. I hope that by this point it is obvious for what reasons you should choose either of the platforms. However, considering two different approaches that Google and Facebook Ads carry, it’s best to combine them in your marketing mix. 

While Facebook Ads bring you the desired coverage, introduces your brand name to the crowds, and creates a buyer intent, Google Ads step up as a sales boost. Once a person knows what product he or she needs, your ad at the top of the search results will do the job.

However, if you choose to divide the marketing budget between those 2 platforms, you need a fabulous analytics tool that will analyze the performance and help you make better advertising decisions.

8112,25 Ways to Promote Your Business in 2023,"When digital marketing entered the room, we got so many ways to advertise a business. But some of the creative ways for advertisement may hide behind an obvious choice of running Facebook or Google Ads. In a world of startup competition and never-ending marketing hustle, it’s important to introduce diversification of ways to promote your business. 

Let’s investigate 25 ways we recommend for companies to advertise their businesses, grow ROI and attract new audiences 😎
1. Social Media
Create a strategy utilizing social media resources. If you were told to do it many times before, but still haven’t implemented the strategy, here some statistics. 

 	90% of the marketers have managed to say that social media increased their business exposure and 75% increased traffic. 
 	21% of the consumers are more likely to buy if they can reach out to the business via social media. 
 	83% of the marketers ranked social media their #2 contributor to success (right after SEO). 


via GIPHY
Each of the networks has its own benefits depending on the type of business you run. In the article about finding traffic, we created a table with info about each social network to help you make up your mind about which network to utilize.  

You have to choose social media depending on the service/product you offer and depending on the target audience you set for yourself. It is super important to choose the right channels for your strategy if you want to harvest from your social media accounts. 
2. UGC
UGC stands for User Generated Content. Sounds good, but what does it mean, and how you can apply it to your business marketing strategy? 

First, let’s discuss why this method of advertising your business is effective. It is one of the most cost-efficient ways to promote your product or service because you just need to make the first move — then your audience will do the job for you. One of the most vivid platforms right now for UGC is TikTok, but Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube work perfectly too. 
If a business comes up with a “trend”, thousands of users can recreate the trend and promote your product without any effort from your side. 

Let’s look at the Chipotle example: the brand created the #lidflipchallenge (see the example). Which just in the first week resulted in more than 100k contributors recreating the challenge and 100+ million views on TikTok.

3. LinkedIn Blogging 
Wondering which social network has the best algorithms for organic growth in 2021? Spoiler: it’s definitely not Facebook 😁 Most social networks do not work anymore for organic growth, they prefer paid ads. 
But LinkedIn started transforming its ecosystem a few years ago which led it to be the #1 network for organic social media growth for B2B.


Consider checking tips posted by LinkedIn on how to grow a social following for your business. But nobody will tell you more about content creation on LinkedIn than content creator on LinkedIn. 
So check out the advice from Dave Gerhardt (CMO at Privy) in one of his recent posts: 


4. Twitter 
Twitter stands along with LinkedIn as social media for professionals (but an unofficial one😁). It is a great place to network, share your precious opinion and find link-minded people. As well as it’s a good place for provocative threads that catch the attention of the audience and become viral. 

Twitter works incredibly well for tech. Entrepreneurs, developers, and creators hang out there and hold intelligent conversations, discussing the latest news and arguing (but just a bit). For tech startups, Twitter can become a great way to network. Just find a bunch of entrepreneurs that inspire you, follow them and join the wild threads — share your opinion and help others if you can. 

But Twitter works for traditional marketing too. All you have to do is to bring attention to your tweets and cause massive reposts (or even reshares to other social networks). You can witness the infamous example from Burger King from the 8th of March. 

That’s how the company wanted to attract attention to the fact that there is still the prevalence of the male in the restaurant industry. Have no idea how this initiative affected the sales on Burger King's side. But it is a great example of how tweets can become viral and even be featured in most of the big media! 
5. Contests
There is a lot of fuss around contests on the Internet. But if done properly, it might become a great additional way to advertise your business and get customers’ attention. 

We would recommend starting with having your product or service as a prize and not other expensive items. Even though it might generate more traffic if you decide to give away MacBook or iPhone, it might attract not the type of audience that will convert later on and become a frequent customer. 

Think about the conditions of the contest you want to choose and try to throw some UGC (you already know the power of the phenomenon) shadow so you wouldn’t have to invest a lot in the promotion of the contest and let it promote itself. 
6. Paid Ads
No matter how much you invest in social or content, paid ads will still play a huge role when it comes to boosting your sales. Paid Ads work perfectly to advertise your business when you already invested in your brand awareness (like personal brand development, social media, content marketing, etc.). 

Once the audience already knows about your existence, you can use targeting and remarketing to remind them that they actually have to purchase your product. 

When you run paid advertising, it is a good idea to acquire ad tracking for your marketing strategy. Tools like RedTrack can consolidate the data from all the platforms where you run ads (FB, Google, YouTube, etc.) and give you valuable insights about the performance. 
7. Influencer Marketing 
If 5 years ago only a few companies used this strategy for advertisement, now everyone wants to get a blogger in their marketing army. 

Don’t forget that influence starts not only with crazy popular bloggers, but also small niche ones. Even if an influencer has 1000-5000 subs, he/she can deliver a lot of value if your audience matches. 

Moreover, it’s also about how influencers deliver the information (promotion in this case) to their followers. The audience is getting smarter by the day and they will not be caught with a simple ad on your business. Try finding a blogger who will be able to deliver the value you have in a creative and catchy manner.
8. Develop Personal/Company Brand 
We don't always remember the brand names, but we definitely remember people who stand behind the wheel. If you want to make your brand remarkable, you have to pay attention to the person and identity behind it. 
For majorities, it doesn’t matter what companies do, if they see such names as Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, Jeff Besos, Ray Dalio, etc. It’s true, these are really big names in the industry, but there is still a place to fill your business niche with your name in it. 

You might wonder, what does “develop your personal brand” advice really imply? What do I have to do? Good question which does not have a definitive answer as it involves a multitude of activities and only you as the owner can define what strategy suits you. We will discover them one by one in the upcoming ways of promotion.

But if we had to explain personal brand in one sentence, we would say the following.

Let yourself be the brand. 

Your name has to pop out before the actual brand name. To achieve that, you have to form an alliance with social media, traditional media, become a frequent guest of industry-specific live streams and podcasts. You may share your opinions in media, collaborate with other businesses. But your face has to be seen and your voice has to be heard if you want to skyrocket the sales of your company. 
9. Live Streams 
Even though it’s a time and resource-consuming type of advertisement, it pays off very well in the trust of your potential customers. It works very simply: people love seeing other people. And when they see you run Live Streams (especially if that happens consistently), they trust you and the product your produce more. 
Tips if you decide to advertise your business with Live Streams: 

 	Take care of the quality (video, sound, streaming platform, etc). 
 	Find a good presenter in your company (even better if it’s CEO or a person in a similar position)
 	Find collaborators
 	Cover trending topicsWe use this strategy ourselves at RedTrack and we can definitely notice the increased loyalty of the customers as well as new leads flowing from YouTube and Facebook.

10. Podcasting 


Podcasting is a new normal. I have no idea how the mic sales are doing right now, but pretty sure it’s booming! If you have the skill, the expertise, or even some stories to share, it’s worth trying podcasting. 

The study shows that U.S. podcast ad revenue grew by 19% in 2020. And I guess that’s not the end of the trend of bringing conversations into the podcast format. 

If a YouTube channel or any kind of video format is not for you, consider delivering value with audio. It is a nice way to bond with the audience, show your expertise, collaborate with other creators, and find new customers along the way! 

For inspiration, check out Podcasts hosted by Gary Vee and Dave Gerhardt.
11.YouTube Channel 
Youtube is one of the most powerful tools if we talk about combining social media, personal brand, and expertise demonstration. Launching Youtube Channel is a long-term investment, but you have to keep in mind that Youtube is basically a Google #2. 
Ideas on how to advertise your business with Youtube Channel: 

 	Create video explainers on topics that your business is related to 
 	Create video reviews 
 	Invite collaborators — co-create content together 
 	Include short promos in the videos you produce (be sure not to make it the whole point of the video, because YouTube communities love value over promos)

Ask yourself the following questions before creating a channel: 

 	What am I (my business) good at? What kind of expertise I (my business) will be able to provide? 
 	How is my business unique? What defines us as a company? 
 	Who is a natural presenter in the company (it could be you, but could be one of your employees)? 
 	What kind of content we will be able to produce on a regular basis within a 6 month period? 

What is very important to note about advertising on YouTube: it won’t be an overnight growth. It is a slow growth strategy where you might expect some results in 3-6 months, but in some cases in a year. YouTube cherishes consistency (post within one time period in similar times), trending topics, engagement in the first few days. So make sure to promote your video as much as possible after you upload it (add it to the newsletter, post on social media, forums, etc.)
A great business YouTube channel is born where value and expertise join the passion of a presenter who can put information in a lightweight and simple way. 
For example, we started a new series on our YouTube channel at RedTrack where we plan to reveal technical topics in digital marketing (like tracking, attribution, Facebook CAPI, etc.), follow along to see the result of this initiative!



12. Creating courses 
In the last few years, the trend of education occupied the market. Thousands of online schools, courses, and workshops happening daily. However, you are not late for the party. If you have unique knowledge applicable to the industry of your product or service, creating a course can be a great way to get new leads.

The new audience that you will attract may differ (especially from audiences you get from contest promotions) in a positive way. So this way to advertise your business is highly recommended for complicated businesses (in tech, for example). You will get an opportunity not only to break down the industry concepts but explain peculiarities about your product that might move the lead to purchase your service faster. 

If you do not want to invest in a production of a full course, you may also consider hosting:

 	Online workshop/webinars 
 	Host a digital conference
 	Create a guide 

All those methods work like magic to find well-educated leads that will turn to your loyal customers. 
13. SEO
Many businesses still underestimate Search Engine Optimization as advertising tactics. 
SEO helps people find you instead of you trying to chase them. 
SEO is all about letting the search engine play to the advance of your company. What you want to achieve is to have your content on top of every search query connected to the problems and issues your business solves for the customer. 
What do I do to advertise your business with SEO? 

 	Create a content marketing strategy around the topics where your business holds an expertise 
 	Collaborate with other blogs/businesses in order for them to cite your content or refer to your company (guest posts, streams, etc.) 
 	Implement link building (we will talk about this later in a designated point)
 	Optimize your website and landing pages for search (use correct keywords, check the load speed, etc.)

SEO might not be easy to deal with if you are not a professional, so consider hiring a specialist before saying that this method does not bring you enough leads. A SEO specialist will be able to cast research in order to find all the right keywords, which will help you create a strategy and optimize your business for search engines. 
14. Content marketing 
Content marketing is a big part of SEO, but it deserves a separate place on this list. If to put it in a simple way, content marketing drives customers’ attention and sales through the content your company produces. So that may involve social media activity, writing blog posts, filming videos, etc. Any type of content that generates traffic and increases your brand awareness works great for this type of marketing. 

We already had a word about social media and YouTube videos, so here we can elaborate on the Blog.

Starting a blog is a great way to cover topics that your audience finds interesting/acute at the moment and incorporate a little reminder about the service your company offers with a pretty CTA (click to action). 
To find your topics for the blog, you might need an SEO specialist again to evaluate the volume of search queries and trendiness of the subject. 
15. Link building 
Linkbuilding is a part of SEO strategy, but it still deserves a separate point. First, let’s break down what is link building.
Link building is a process of earning hyperlinks from other websites leading to your website. 
It helps the Search Engine to crawl the web pages and increases the trustworthiness of your website if the system sees that many other resources link you. Therefore, it is one of the most effective ways to increase your search ranking. 

Not only hyperlinks on other valuable resources give you a direct advertisement but help you with SEO. However, the process of earning links can be a real pain. It may involve hours of e-mails to different businesses and loss of hope. Don't give up just yet: try to test different e-mail templates, always make sure to offer 
16. Newsletter 
Email-newsletter is a great way to communicate with your potential customers and remind them about cool features your business offers. 

Don’t use a newsletter just to directly promote your business on a weekly basis (most likely it will cause a huge amount of unsubscribes), but use it as a way to deliver news and updates, communicate what’s happening to your company and how it evolves. 
Kinds of the newsletters you can run to advertise your business: 
1. Product news and updates newsletter
Customers may not want to purchase from a promo, but they might want to buy because of a specific feature you developed. Communicate the value and the progress your company makes. 

2. Blog newsletter
If your company is running a blog, most of the customers will miss the content you produce. Don’t be scared to share with them once a month the articles you wrote in a quick digest. 

3. Tips &amp; Insight Newsletter
As we probably already discovered, people love the value you deliver. Consider hosting a newsletter with tips, tricks, and insights from your industry/area of expertise. Your potential customer will get to know your company better as a provider of expertise and might wanna purchase your product in the future. 
17. Invest in media coverage 
Media coverage can be divided into paid media and earned media (as you can guess for one you pay and the other you earn). If everything is pretty clear with paid articles, there are a lot of questions about the earned media. Most likely this is the one you are scared about. How to get to the big media? How to be interesting to be featured? 

Media coverage is one of the best ways to increase your business publicity and brand awareness, but you probably think that it works only if you get featured in resources like Forbes. 

Eventually, you can start slow. Start by writing articled to media that is easier to access, but where your target audience might hang out.

 	Find TOP-30 (or choose your number) media in your niche/industry 
 	Review their rules and requirements for writing 
 	Pitch the idea of the article to the responsible employee
 	Send the draft (verify it according to style guidelines and other requirements for the articles) 

Well, if you still want to be featured in media like Forbes, CNN, etc. there is another lifehack. Check out writers on Fiverr (or other freelance marketplaces), for a fee they can help you present the article to the platform you desire.



18. Affiliate marketing
Affiliate marketing (AM) is a well-known way of promotion. AM is about giving others a chance to sell your product or offer for a small commission. Why is it good for your business? 
Well, technically if there is no sale, you don’t have to pay anything. In comparison to other ways of marketing and advertising, this is the most cost-efficient one. 
How can you start working with affiliate marketers? 
The easiest way to start is by placing your offer on affiliate networks/marketplaces (like Digistore24 or Clickbank) where businesses meet marketers. You can easily place your offer on the platform and forget about the hassle when affiliate marketers are trying to advertise your business for you.

However, it is important to track results and analyze the performance of affiliate marketers if you implement this strategy. You will need the help of an ad tracking tool that will track CR (conversion rates) and verify the numbers with marketers for any discrepancies. 

At RedTrack, we have more than 80 integrations with ad networks that will help you set up tracking in no time and see the results of affiliate marketers who joined the advertising of your offer. 
19. Collaborations
Collaborations are a great way to advertise your business by joining forces with other creators, businesses who can have the share of the audience that you missed attracting earlier. 
Types of collaborations for businesses advertisement: 

 	Collaboration with Influencers
You can not only advertise your product directly through bloggers, but try to create certain products together or develop features that you did not think about before. The influence that bloggers hold may force people to purchase products or services if they see the name of their favorite bloggers mentioned there.
 	Collaboration with other Businesses
If you have in mind a great company with similar values as yours, working in a similar field, but creating a different product — why not exchanging the customers? For example, both of your companies create SaaS marketing tools, but one works with automation and another with e-mail marketing. You are not direct competitors, therefore, nothing bad will happen if you create a custom integration, spice it up with few live streams and exclusive deals. 

20. Affiliate program 
Starting an affiliate program is almost the same as affiliate marketing but different. Let’s learn how :) 

If you want to use simple affiliate marketing, you can just use any network/platform that posts your offer and gets affiliates on board to advertise it. But affiliate program works by the rules that you predefine. 

The classic examples of affiliate programs are Amazon, Shopify, or Fiverr. Therefore, affiliate programs are a great way of advertisement for eCom. Eventually, we already did a good job explaining all the basic (and advanced lifehacks) of how to start an affiliate program for your eCom business, so give it a read! 

At RedTrack we also offer the ability to create your own white-label affiliate program and set your own rules 😎 Connect to our specialists to learn how you can escalate sales with affiliate programs. 
21. Build a community
Building a community is a precious piece of advice that helped many businesses grow. It is a known way to get customers’ trust and attention, a clear way of communication with your audience without any interference.
You basically get instant access to their feedback, issues they have and have a way to deliver the values and achievements of your business. 
Where can you build a community to advertise your business: 

 	Facebook Groups (by far the most popular tactics)
 	LinkedIn Groups (or account as well) — works perfectly for B2B sales
 	Telegram channels 
 	Clubhouse (quite new, but we all know what Clubhouse managed to do as a community builder)
 	YouTube channel (even though we have it as a separate point, YouTube is a great platform for your community) 

22. Forums 
If you thought that forums are dead, you are wrong. Forums quite happily exist in 2021, just they had to transform. To jump-start your promotions via forums you have to conduct research first to find out what are platforms that people use in your niche.
When you know what are the websites, you are ready to start… promoting? No! The rule of the forum has not changed from the times they were invented. A blind promo will not work. A forum is a place for contribution, help, and advice — you can either provide it or ask relevant questions yourself. 

If you want to implement forums in your marketing strategy, you have to prepare to spend your quality time on those websites helping users and delivering value. Only gently adding advertisement of your company. However, it is a great way to find the audience concentrated on the subject you need.
23.Reddit
Another scary marketing technique. We know that businesses are terrified of getting on the Reddit grounds, but you should trust us if we tell it’s worth it. Actually, we already created a complete guide on how to utilize content marketing on Reddit as well as Reddit Ads. 
But here are a few highlights you have to keep in mind: 

 	Reddit is #1 forum ecosystem for 2021 where you can find engaged audiences in particular subreddits (Reddit micro-forums related to a specific topic)
 	If you earned the trust of the community, you are ready to throw some pretty promotions to the subreddits
 	Reddit Paid Ads allow you to show your message to the same engaged communities, you can target it to the subreddit of your choice, therefore you can choose which audience will most likely interact with your company

24. Invest time in reviews 


Reviews can work to increase buyers’ intent. Especially if your product is considered to be of higher quality, people prefer to investigate what others think before investing big amounts of money. And we are not talking about fake reviews. It’s simply about reminding satisfied customers that they can leave their feedback on platforms you are interested in. Most of the customers will be happy to share their opinion about your product if you remind them. 
Take care of your reviews on the following platforms: 

 	G2
 	Trustpilot
 	Capterra 
 	Industry-related review platforms (like Yelp for restaurant reviews)
25. Networking

As old as marketing itself is networking. 2020 and the digital transformations, in general, made a few corrections on the way of how we can network. If earlier we had to make it in person at conferences, events, and dinners, now we can just open our laptop and find everything we need just one click away. 

What is great now, that the same old types of networking (e.g. conferences) are moved to the digital. Participating in digital events not only introduces you to the new customers but also to fellow businesses with who you can co-create and advance what you have already. It is a great base to establish partnerships and collaborations with businesses that can benefit your development. 
Bonus point: combine &amp; analyze
It is very important not to keep all eggs in one basket. So if you choose only to invest in social, you will miss out on a lot of opportunities. Modern marketing is based on the concept of diversification. 
Choose anywhere from 5 to 10 ways to advertise your business and analyze results. 
Marketing analytics is a crazy important step in your strategy because you want to cut off all methods that do now work for your business as fast as possible. Only reliable data gives you an opportunity to connect all the dots and advertise your business properly 😏 A tool that can help you deliver the data for analysis is tracking software. Our team has already prepared a video on how to choose a perfect tracking software to achieve your revenue milestones, so check it out!

8151,RedTrack's Product Update (Late spring 2021),"You all know that RedTrack’s team has been working very very hard on Facebook CAPI integration. We didn’t just release an out-of-the-box solution, but we also keep working on improving it by doing weekly and monthly updates. However, RedTrack doesn’t end on Facebook CAPI! There were a bunch of other exciting things happening to the tool in the late spring. 

Therefore, we decided to bring it all together in one article and cover all the updates that RedTrack scored. Follow along!
UPD: We already have a new product update covering changes that we made over summer 2021, check the video with a description of the features and setup screensharing!
&nbsp;


New UI in beta
If you haven’t tested the new interface already, check it out. It was a very long-awaited update and we are now testing a new interface that could fit all the needs of our users. Be sure to give us feedback so we could improve and provide the best tool possible whenever the new UI goes live!



Core tracking 
Here you will find a bunch of updates that touch the core tracking functionality RedTrack provides. Learn more about custom payouts, postback logs, Woocommerce updates, etc.!
Custom payouts for any traffic source

At RedTrack we are dedicated to providing you with flexibility. Custom payouts become handy when you want to adjust the reward according to the performance (or other variables) of your affiliates/partners. 

Now it is possible at RedTrack to set custom payouts for CPA / RevShare campaigns in campaigns on the following levels:

 	Country-level, when payout set for a specific country overrides default campaign settings
 	SubID value level, when payout set for a particular subbed value overrides default campaign settings.


Postback logs for conversion passed via API
This feature is great if you want to troubleshoot your API performance. If something is off on your campaign performance, you can easily go to postback logs to verify if all the conversions have been sent. 

Find the data on all the postbacks sent to Google, Facebook, or Bing via custom conversion API integrations. To access those logs please go to Logs → Conversion API.


Cost update logs for automatic API-based cost updates
Another feature that provides you the ability to control your API integrations. Access the logs for your cost updates in order to receive detailed data about costs, time of the update &amp; other details about the campaign. Always be sure that you know when the click was created and whether the costs updated accurately. 

Access the log of automatic API-based cost updates done by RedTrack.io for your campaigns. To access those logs please go to Logs → Cost Updates.
Woocommerce postback 
In order to avoid the confusion of algorithms when facing different identification of currencies, we worked on a solution for Woocommerce postback to be able to differentiate those currencies with no problem. 

E.g. Sometimes postbacks can contain additional symbols in {sum} value, in payout={sum} to record conversion payout / revenue, like 15zl or $10.

Now RedTrack can 'read' the payout value and add those custom scenarios manually to train the system that payout={15zl} is the same as payout={15}&amp;currency=PLN
Publisher panel
New tokens: conversion ID &amp; conversion type
We had requests for many publishers to develop another sort of conversion identification rather than click ID. Therefore, we created new tokens for the publisher panel. 

Now your publishers (affiliates) can use two additional tokens/macros when adding postbacks in the white-label publisher panel. Or you can add them yourself in the publisher management screen.

 	{convid} — sends conversions
 	{convtype}  — sends conversion type (as specified in custom conversion type settings in RedTrack.io)

Please note that publisher management is available to RedTrack.io Team+ subscribers
Automation
Auto-optimization improvements
Now we provide even more value when it comes to granular data for advanced automation. This set of updates is for PRO users who have certain requirements for their campaign automation sequences. 



New automation settings are:

 	Weight multiplier. As there can be more than one winning combination, you can now define how much traffic a winning combination will get. The higher the weight — the more traffic will be sent to it compared to other winning combinations.
 	The threshold for optimizing by subID. If you use optimization based on subID value. (e.g. placement or publisher), you can specify how many clicks a specific value should receive in the learning period to be included in optimization. E.g.: you do not want to keep traffic distribution as it is if a particular placement delivered you less than 100 clicks.

API integrations 
We take out time to provide value with simplified API integrations (like Facebook, Google, Bing, and 20+ other sources) at RedTrack. Find the latest updates in regards to API integrations for the RedTrack platform. 
Improved Google automatic cost updates 
As RedTrack used to update costs only on the campaign level, we kept working on providing better depth for automatic cost updates. Now you are able to get more data for automation and optimization purposes with several levels of cost-updates.  

RedTrack.io can now automatically update costs for integrated Google accounts at the campaign, ad group, and ad level to give you more control over the tracking. 
Pro and Advanced plans have cost updates on ad group level. Team+ plans have cost updates of ad level.
Improved Facebook automatic cost updates
The same goes for Facebook, utilize cost updates on several levels for Facebook Conversion API to get more from automation and make better optimization decisions. 

RedTrack.io can now automatically update costs for integrated Facebook accounts of the campaign, ad set, and ad level.
Pro and Advanced plans have cost updates on ad set level. Team+ plans have cost updates of ad level.
Improved Event Match Quality for Facebook
One of the problems that we had after the iOS 14 changes is Facebook had very low Event Match Quality, which affected attribution on FB. Facebook now required a lot of data to make sure that conversions happening are eligible and trustworthy. But guess what? We fixed that too 😎

RedTrack.io now sends more data to Facebook to improve Event Match Quality and therefore improve conversion attribution. We send the following data now: city, country, external ID, subscription ID, event ID, content ID. 
Multi-pixel for Facebook Conversion API 
One of the most exciting updates is the possibility to use multiple pixels for your campaigns. Now you have a chance to add as many pixels as you like on the offer level if you wish to use separate pixels for different events.

Using multipixel is good for two types of cases: if you want to separate each conversion type by pixel or simply for the purpose of the backup.

To add pixels: Go to Offers → Edit offer → Scroll down → Set Default Action Source → Add Pixels 



Send some types of conversion via FB, Google, or Bing
It was truly a highly requested feature and we understand why! Not every conversion type should actually influence your optimization decisions. If you want to gain control over the optimization of your ads, it’s important to manage the conversion types you are sending to the source. 

Now with RedTrack, you have more control over conversions for your API integrations (Facebook, Google, and Bing). You can choose certain types of conversions for a conditional postback while before the update RedTrack was sending all the conversions automatically.




To access the feature go to Tools → Conversion Tracking → Conversion Types. You can read more about conditional postback in our knowledge base.

Bing Auto-cost updates
Just like with other API integrations, we developed an auto-cost update solution for Bing (Microsoft Ads) for you to be in constant control over the spending of your budget. It gives you a chance to make faster and better decisions when planning your campaigns. 
Click ID in Conversion API logs
If you need to quickly test your conversion API integrations and find any mistakes/conversions, this update is for you. Now you can find the required conversion in Conversion API logs using the ClickID with help of a special filter. 
Reporting
CPA for conversion types 
Another amazing update that gives you flexibility. If you are running ads with several conversion types, you do want to calculate CPA separately and not put all the eggs in one basket. To do that we developed CPA for each conversion type.
Now you can see individual acquisition cost for each conversion type used. To add it, go to “Column set-up” and add relevant CPA columns to the active view.

&nbsp;


Pre-Landing Page / Landing Page CTR metrics
If you an affiliate, there is a high chance you are making use of advanced user funnels (taking a user from multiple landing pages and to the advertiser itself). You do need a few more metrics to analyze the performance of the ads you run, therefore we worked on the advanced metrics for those funnels. 

Now you can also measure pre-lander page effectiveness as Pre-LP / LP CTR, a ratio between visitors coming to the pre-lander and proceeding to the landing page. 

To add it: Go to Column set-up and add Pre-LP / LP CTR to the active view.


Other

User multi-access by campaign
We worked as well on improved multi-access. If you are using your RedTrack account with several partners, you can now choose also to give access to certain campaigns. Well, as we already said, flexibility. 
There is never too much control over your marketing tracking &amp; analytics 😎



&nbsp;
Conclusion
Other minor updates and changes have been added as well, but these are the most important updates for you to keep in mind for now. As always, at RedTrack we are devoted to providing the best from tracking, analytics, and attribution, so be sure to leave your feedback or requests in any of our channels (social media or using the support email). Happy tracking! ",6/2/2021,https://redtrack.io/blog/redtrack-product-update-spring21/,RedTrack features
8188,Everything You Need to Know about Aggregated Events Measurement,"When Apple released the iOS 14 update, Facebook had to play the game under different conditions. FB released a bunch of updates (let’s say that it didn’t make the life of FB marketers easier). One of them was a mysterious Aggregated Events Measurement (AEM) that works as an alias of Facebook Conversion API.

We can agree that AEM has a terribly scary name that doesn’t give us any clue what to do with it and how to use it for the benefit of your Facebook Ads campaigns. Therefore, as one of the pioneers of FB CAPI integration, we will take the bullet for you and break down this complicated term. 
Follow along! 
How did Aggregated Events Measurement appear
Web safety has been a concern for both users (and hopefully advertisers) for a long time now. One by one, big tech companies are stepping on a cookieless path. Though Apple has been one of the fierce warriors in regards to the security on the web (or they want to appear that way). Safari was one of the first browsers to block third-party cookies. But 2021 was a year when the company went wild releasing the ATT prompt meaning that users starting iOS 14 could opt out of tracking. Well, we know you are a pro advertiser, and you know what it means for the industry.

Apple’s App Tracking Transparency update impacted all apps on the App Store, Facebook included. Facebook Ads are strongly dependent on the user data tracked, so the company had to implement measures to maintain the performance that advertisers would enjoy. Of course, Facebook marketers still were and are pissed off by the changes — let’s face that it’s not as easy as before.


One of the main ways to combat changes was the introduction of Aggregated Events Measurement (AEM). It works alongside Facebook Conversion API to help us, advertisers, harvest goodness from our Facebook Ads. 

If you want to learn more about the work of Facebook CAPI, check out our YouTube video!


What is Aggregated Events Measurement
Aggregated Events Measurement (AEM) is a special protocol by Facebook that allows measuring web events after the iOS14 Update influence. That is a kind of a safe way for Facebook to track and optimize your ads’ performance.
Aggregated Events Measurement replaces Facebook Pixel? 
We receive a lot of questions from our audience about the death of Facebook Pixel. Don’t worry, Facebook Pixel is live and healthy. Just a little bit deprived 😅 Facebook Pixel still serves as a source of data for events and is a big part of the AEM ecosystem. FB Pixel feeds data to AEM that is further used for optimization.

You can use one or multiple pixels for your campaigns, depending on your needs for  Facebook advertising. 


Still, AEM comes with several discomforts:

 	You can upload now only 8 events for configuration (aka optimization)
 	You have to choose a priority for those 8 events you uploaded 🥲
 	8 events work for all the pixels associated with this account/domain
 	You can not upload just any event to AEM (the secret to be revealed later in the article)


The secret to using Aggregated Events Measurement
One of the troubles we encountered with our team at RedTrack was inability to add any event to Aggregated Events Measurement. Apparently (but don’t tell anyone we told you), there’s a hidden metric to evaluate if Facebook thinks the event “deserves” to be a part of your AEM. 

Facebook wants to see some friction around the event that you want to optimize for, so it requires some clicks &amp; conversions to be generated first. 
From our experience, the required number of conversions needed to “warm-up” the event is around 20-30 during  48 hours. It is not a set number, every event acts differently like wild species.  
This could be a problem for those who want to optimize ads as fast as possible after creating the event for the campaign. However, there is a solution for that which is called ""warm-up"" of the event. You can do it by uploading ""fake"" conversions and sending them to Facebook to notice the friction. You can't really do it on a Facebook side, but toold like RedTrack help you do that. Let's discover how to generate fake conversions in the next chapter. 
How to generate fake conversions to upload events to Aggregated Events Measurement
Fake conversions can help you fast-forward the optimization for particular events in your FB Business Manage. RedTrack is a tool that can help you do that in few simple steps. 
All you have to do is use existent click IDs and upload them as conversions through RedTrack's platform. Then our tool will automatically send those conversions to Facebook. For a detailed step-by-step on your account warm-up, please follow the guide. 
We don’t suggest generating fake conversions simultaneously in bulk as Facebook may not accept them. Upload few conversion every few hours. 
To-do list for success with Aggregated Events Measurement 
There are a lot of little details you have to take into account if you want your FB campaigns to be successful. We put it all in a nice checklist for you not to mess up the whole story.
 1) Verify your domain
At RedTrack, we talk about it all the time. This is by far the most important step to run FB Ads in 2021. Facebook has to identify the source of conversions as trustworthy and compliant with all the updates. Operation of CAPI and Aggregated Events Measurement is not possible without domain verification. 
If you are an affiliate and you don’t have access to the advertiser’s offer page (where conversion happens) , keep in mind that we have a solution for you. Be sure to check out our article to find out how domain verification works or simply book a demo to gain access to the feature. 
2) Integrate Facebook Conversion API
Aggregated Events Measurement won’t work unless you implement Facebook CAPI, so be sure to learn how to do it first. 
3) Generate fake conversions to upload events to Aggregated Events Measurement
If you don’t wanna wait until real conversions start generating, consider doing a fake conversion method. It’s harmless unless you remember to do few conversions per day, don’t just upload them all at once. It's an absolutely optional step, but a nice one if you are in a rush. 

Alternatively, you may just run a test campaign and wait for conversions to be generated naturally. 
4) Choose 8 events for Aggregated Events Measurement
If you had complex funnels before, you will have to rearrange things and choose the most important events for your campaigns. Remember that 8 events work for all the pixels that you use across this domain. 
5) Choose priority for events in Aggregated Events Measurement 
Define which events deserve more priority than others. Remember that first event gets the biggest priority and the last gets the least priority. 
6) Optimize your campaign for the event of your choice
After the event has successfully made it to AEM, it's time to go back to your FB Ads Manager and optimize the campaign for the needed events. Harvest the fruits!

&nbsp;

By the way, if you still didn’t figure out how to integrate CAPI, start conversion tracking &amp; optimize for the events of your choice, check out the guide our team prepared!



 
Conclusion
We know that Facebook confused us all, marketers, with CAPI and AEM. We hope this article made it clearer that AEM is not your enemy, but rather the only friend at this dark FB Ads times. Remember, that maintenance of the FB performance is not as easy now, but still possible with all the tricks and tips that we try to educate you with on a regular basis.

8225,Best AdSense Alternatives to Consider for Your Site in 2023,"Making money off of your online content has never been easier than today. Advertising networks can allow for various ads to pop up on your pages and thus give you some additional income. For smaller creators, this income can help with maintenance fees. For bigger creators, these ads can become a real source of income. 

Probably the most popular advertising network is AdSense (from tech giant Google). AdSense is used in over 10 million websites. It is lightweight, reliable, and efficient at what it does. 

Google AdSense is an incredibly popular and potent tool that enables millions of people to make money online. It can help monetize websites, blogs, videos, and a lot of other online material. But sometimes AdSense can be a difficult tool to use as Google constantly changes its rules and algorithms. Therefore, in this article, we are going to explore the best alternatives to AdSense to monetize your content.  
Why you need an AdSense alternative
What are the main reasons that people search for Google AdSense alternatives? Well, there are a lot of disadvantages that Adsense has, which the competition simply doesn’t. And this can make a massive difference. Here are some of the biggest differences:
Requirements
Adsense as well as most networks require some sort of eligibility confirmation before you can start running ads. While Google isn’t that strict with their requirements, they do have a more rigorous control system than other networks. If Google doesn’t approve your page for advertising, or your AdSense account is disabled for some reason, you will need some sort of alternative. 
Customization
Google AdSense is built to cover a broad slate of websites, blogs, video platforms, and other online content. This means that if you are in a specific niche, AdSense might not be the best decision for you. Some alternatives have much better customization and can provide a tailored solution for your specific case. 
Revenue Share
Publishers receive 68% of the revenue generated with AdSense. This is in no way a bad rate, but there are better rates that can make you more money. You will have to have a great website with high traffic to qualify for those bigger cuts. 
Minimum Payout
AdSense has a minimum payout of $100. If you have a small website that doesn’t get a lot of traffic, this might be a big number for you. Some Google AdSense alternatives have smaller payouts that are much more attractive to small pages and blogs. 
Additional Revenue
Sometimes you won’t want to completely replace AdSense. This is why a lot of marketers use companion networks to run alongside AdSense. This leads to an additional income source that is not directly tied to one company. You will have to check if you are breaching some ToS doing this before you decide to sign up for multiple networks though. 
Best Google AdSense Alternatives
Monumetric
Previously known as “The Blogger Network”, Monumetric is a blog-focused advertising network. Unlike most networks, It runs cost-per-impression (CPI) instead of cost-per-click (CPC). This is perfect for popular blogs whose audiences don’t convert as much as they would like to. 

Monumetric has four monetization tiers which are based on your monthly visits. You will need a minimum of 10,000 monthly visits and if you are under 80,000 you will have to pay a $99 fee to set everything up. Payout on the other hand is great, the minimum is only $10 and you can do it via PayPal or direct deposit!
RevContent


If you are big into native ads, RevContent might be the perfect AdSense alternative for you. The platform has a great reputation amongst publishers and advertisers. RevContent offers ads in display, video, and mobile formats, but that’s not all. It is partnered with publishers that usually generate a lot of hits, and pay higher commissions. The catch is that the selection process is very tough to get through. To even be considered, you will have to get more than 50,000 visitors monthly. 

 Payments are usually done monthly and the minimum payout is $50.
Adnimation 
Adnimation is a Google Certified Publishing Partner (GCPP) that specializes in optimizing ad revenue and RPMs for publishers. With hundreds of publishers both in the US and worldwide, Adnimation combines advanced technology and expert human guidance to maximize revenue while ensuring an excellent user experience.
Adnimation offers a complete ad management solution, including all of the highest-performing ad units and proprietary ad technology. With no lock-in contract and full transparency, publishers can be sure that they are receiving the best possible results and service.

AdThrive
AdThrive takes great care of its bloggers. It’s a CPI network that works closely with advertisers and publishers to optimize everything. This AdSense alternative gives an incredible 75% payout directly to the publishers. Which is one of the highest percentages in the industry. But this ad network is not for newcomers. It has tough requirements like a minimum of 100k monthly visits, of which the most have to be from the US. 

The minimum payout is $25, which is not that important since you should expect a lot more from such a massive blog!
Mediavine
Mediavine is similar to AdThrive but requires a lot fewer monthly visitors (min. 50,000). It is great for long-form content blogs and its ads are mostly catered to the lifestyle niche. The team at Mediavine can also brag about their incredible support, which is always helpful and available. 

The minimum payout is $25 for PayPal and $200 for international direct deposit. 
Media.net
Contextual advertising is what this AdSense alternative is made for. Media.net is run by Bind and Yahoo, and it’s considered one of the best alternatives to Google’s platform. Most features are very similar to AdSense, even the ad types, approval, and expected revenue. Its connection to Bing and Yahoo gives you exclusive access to contextual ads from searches on these engines. 

The ad network requires your traffic to come mostly from the US, UK, and Canada, which can be an issue for some foreign blogs. 
PropellerAds


PropellerAds is one of the biggest AdSense alternatives. Their offers range from banners, sponsored links to push notifications and video ads. It serves mobile, desktop, and applications as well. Currently, its reach is estimated at around 1 billion users! It has a lot of automation and ad optimizations built-in so that you get the most from your deal with this ad platform. 

There is no minimum requirement for site traffic. 

And the payout minimum is only $5! This makes this one of the best platforms for those just starting!
Amazon Native Shopping Ads
Amazon is one of the biggest tech companies out there. While your first thought of Amazon might lead you to the online shopping part of it, Amazon is a tech company. Advertising is one of the biggest parts of it, revenue-wise. Amazon Native Shopping Ads is a part of the Amazon Associates programs and it is focused on placing native product listings on your blog pages. 

This Google AdSense alternative can make you a lot of money if you are selling or advertising popular products on your blog page. Its reputation makes your pages sound even more legit and it gives users trust that you are legitimate. 
MGID
MGID is one of the biggest advertising networks with more than 850 monthly unique visits that focus on Native Ads. They offer a wide variety of integration types to satisfy the needs of every advertiser and publisher. Moreover, MGID owns an award-winning AI-algorithm connecting the right users to the rights ads at the right moment, making sure that the relevant content is displayed. This approach helps to boost earnings for both: publishers and advertisers. 

The minimum payout is $100 and works on NET30 day terms. This means that your June earnings will be paid out at the end of July. 
AdCash


AdCash serves over 200 million active users and is responsible for over 800,000 app installs each month. It supports most ad formats and its ads are easy to place and customize. There is an option to view real-time reports. Like most advertising networks AdCash uses a Pay per action model for their ads. 

The payout minimum is $25 and you can be paid via an array of payment methods. 
Bidvertiser
As the name might imply, Bidvertiser is an alternative that operates on a bidding system. Rather than placing the ads, Bidvertiser seeks ad space on your page to the highest bidder. 

This has some pros and some cons. The pros are that if you have a popular page, advertisers might bid themselves to incredible amounts. This can leave you with a much bigger paycheck than you would usually get. But the reverse is true as well. If your page is small and unimportant, you might not get any bids at all. 

Before joining you should make sure that your blog is at least somewhat popular and ranking good in the niche it is trying to operate in. The approval of Bidvertiser is simple and I doubt anyone will have any issues with it. 

The minimum payout is $10 through PayPal, and I am sure you will get a lot more out of this incredible platform!
Running Ads Without AdSense
Google AdSense is an incredible platform, but luckily it’s not the only one on the web. There are plenty of competitors worth checking out to fight the monopoly that Google has established on the market ;) There are a lot of AdSense alternatives that can bring you more money and more freedom while advertising. Always compare the available choices and pick the one that makes the most sense to you, your page, and obviously brings you high returns!

But don't forget that if you use multiple channels for advertising, it's smart to bring all of your results to a single dashboard for proper analysis. Take a look at our solution for ad tracking &amp; conversion attribution to find new ways to skyrocket your return on ad spend!

8240,What happened with Google Ads after iOS 14.5,"I know we are all kinda tired from “iOS 14” titles, but it’s still here. And only now we begin to realize all the consequences of the updates released by Apple. The question that we want to answer today is — what is happening with Google Ads after iOS 14.5 Update? What was the real influence of iOS 14.5 and ATT prompt on Google Ads? 

In this article, we will try to find answers to what happened and try to predict the future of the AdTech giant. 

What does iOS 14 Update mean for marketers? 
We have to circle back first and remind you what is iOS 14 Update and what it means for advertisers and marketers. With iOS 14 Apple rolled out ATT (Apple Tracking Transparency) prompt which forced apps to ask users whether they want to opt-out of tracking. 
What influence did it have on advertisers? iOS 14 Update meant that all traffic coming from iOS devices using the latest update had issues with tracking &amp; proper attribution. 

That means that every app on the Apple AppStore had to be ready for changes and for the fact that users will be opting out of tracking. We could see a vivid example of Facebook, which introduced Facebook Conversion API, Aggregated Events Measurement, and new privacy requirements (like domain verification) in order to maintain gathering data about conversions and keep the advertisers’ ability to target and optimize their ads. 
What does Google do with the privacy updates? 
Google is kind of late to the party. Apple has been introducing privacy updates since 2017, this year Facebook followed Apple’s lead and got us some alternatives for tracking &amp; conversion attribution. But what does Google really do? 

Google is preparing its Google Privacy Sandbox which will introduce 5 APIs as substitutes for targeting, remarketing, and conversion attribution functionality. Google Sandbox was supposed to take full effect by 2022 and make sure that third-party cookies are actually phased out of Google Chrome. But in June 2021 Google confirmed that the full rollout of Google Privacy Sandbox is postponed until 2023.

By the way, if you still didn't figure out how to integrate CAPI, start conversion tracking &amp; optimize for the events of your choice, check out the guide our team prepared! 



Does it mean we can forget about problems with cookies? 
Google's delay kinda gives us more time to prepare, we do have to thank them for slipping us more seconds enjoying the company of third-party cookies. However, don't think that you can waste this time for running ads blindly.
Google continues working on and testing features that will allow not to track users individually, but instead — group them in order to perform targeting &amp; remarketing. Two protocols are supposed to give advertisers access to targeting and successful ads: FLoC (Federal Learning of Cohorts) and FLEDGE (First Locally-Executed Decision over Groups Experiment). 
FLoC is there to ensure gathering users in groups according to their interests and browsing history to further allow targeting according to their group IDs. 
FLEDGE is making sure that less data is released about individual users by giving limited data to bidding algorithms through browsers (instead of an ad server like it used to be).
 
Both solutions are supposed to help us advertisers survive through the changes and keep running Google Ads / YouTube Ads, etc. 


But what was the influence of iOS 14.5 Update on Google at the moment?
The main change that we have noticed after the 26th of April (Introduction of iOS 14.5 Update) that Google stopped sending unique conversions through Google click identifier (GCLID) for traffic coming from iOS.

GCLID is a unique parameter in your ad URL that helps with conversion attribution by carrying data about clicks, campaigns, etc. It is required for you to be able to perform ad tracking &amp; conversion attribution for your ads.



Now for iOS traffic GCLID is replaced with WBRAID as an identifier. It’s not really clear yet what is WBRAID as Google documentation doesn’t have a clear description.
Therefore, we can’t be sure at the moment that attribution will work as it supposed to with the new parameter WBRAID. 
How did iOS 14.5 influence Google Ads Search targeting?
Google Search targeting is tied to keywords, rather than your preferences. So search targeting shall keep working as it used to. 
However, if you are going to use RLSA (remarketing lists for search ads), you might face some issues. In the logic of FLoC, users coming from iOS14 traffic would not be individually identified, but grouped by interests. So the targeting for your RLSA might be slightly inaccurate for iPhone users at this point. 
Will iOS 14.5 affect Google Display Ads?
Again, FLoC and FLEDGE protocols will identify healthier web when it comes to running Google Ads. Since Display Ads work on an auction basis, before showing up the ad to a specific user, they need to access the data about the user's preferences and interests. 
Since FLoC is grouping users by interests, Google Display Ads might not work with the same quality as it used to. 

It’s too early to say anything as we will have to test things in the process and evaluate whether the substitutes from Google are working to deliver good results.

Conclusion
As we see, Facebook was a little bit better prepared for the changes coming from iOS Privacy Updates. More or less the tracking &amp; attribution on Facebook Ads is accurate. The influence of iOS 14 on Google Ads was pretty silent but still noticeable. And yet, we don’t know still the full scope of consequences on the performance of your ads. 

First-party data is still the answer to most of the questions that are yet to arrive. If you want to move your tracking &amp; attribution to solutions, relying solely on 1st party cookies, make sure to check out the solution from RedTrack.

8248,Top 10 Affiliate Marketing Programs in 2023,"Recently affiliate marketing has become the go-to method of achieving personal financial goals &amp; success. Driven by the lifestyles of super affiliates and their friends, the image of wealth has been associated with the industry. Of course, not everything is as easy it seems, and to make any sort of real cash, you will have to work long and hard for it. 

Affiliate marketing can be overwhelming for beginners. Starting in this industry can be quite hard since there is a lot of competition and ever-changing rules of the game. Using the best practices and techniques to optimize your content is difficult. Not only are there a bunch of methods to try, but they are also often hard to learn about on your own. This is why even some super affiliates miss every optimization of their content. Anyone can start a blog or website, but not everyone can build it up to something significant. 

One way to help you grow and expand your business is through affiliate marketing programs. If you are wondering what they are, what the best ones are, and which to pick, you are in the right place! Let's learn about the best affiliate programs in 2023!
What is an affiliate program?
Affiliate marketing programs are more or less advanced contracts. This agreement says that businesses will pay other businesses or influencers a commission. This commission is paid for sending traffic or helping make sales or commission. 
So basically affiliate programs are arrangements where online merchants pay affiliates a commission for traffic or sales. The commissions are usually determined beforehand and they are based on performance. 

So to simplify the idea, the more people affiliates get to click on a link, the more money they will make. 
Types of Affiliate Marketing programs
Affiliate programs can vary a bit from program to program. Here are some of the most common types that you will face when searching for affiliate marketing programs. 
Content Affiliate Marketing Programs
These types of affiliate marketing programs focus on blogs and web pages. For these programs, the focus is on creating content-filled pages that people read and enjoy. With such a program, affiliates can promote their products to the audiences and make profits off of that. Most affiliate programs focus on some sort of content marketing for their campaigns. 
Coupon and Review Site Marketing Programs
People are always trying to save money and buy the best product for their money. Because of this, coupon and review sites have been on the rise ever since. A lot of affiliate programs try to capitalize on this, and if you find it interesting, you can try it as well. 
Email Marketing Programs
Email marketing is one of the oldest forms of online marketing. While it declined in popularity in recent years, it is still considered a great way to get your message across to a massive audience. 
Other
There are a lot of types of affiliate marketing programs. Listing them all here would be a waste of time. So let’s mention some of them when we start listing the best affiliate programs you should pick!
How To Choose the Best Affiliate Program
Selecting a good affiliate marketing program can change the way you do business. You can earn much more money with the right programs, and there are a lot of things you can learn to improve your future efforts. 

Some of the biggest benefits of picking the right affiliate programs are:

 	
Great commission rates


Depending on which affiliate program you pick your commissions can vary from decent to incredible. The better-paying programs are usually a bit harder but they also push you to create better campaigns and improve all around. 

 	
Cookie Tracking


Cookies are slowly getting less and less popular due to industry changes. But they still have a massive impact on your campaigns and tracking. Some affiliate programs offer prolonged cookie tracking that can earn you commissions even weeks after your customer has clicked on your link.

 	
Frequency of Payouts


Your commission is great, but to get them, you will need frequent payouts. Finding the ones that fit with your business is important.

 	
Product quality


Affiliates promote all kinds of products in their campaign. Those who are in the business a bit longer know that promoting bad products can taint your reputation and affect your long-term profitability. This is why you should pick affiliate marketing programs that offer better products.

 	
Support


Everyone needs a bit of help sooner or later. This is why good support of affiliate programs is important. The better the support, the more you can rely on your affiliate network being helpful in most situations. 

&nbsp;
The Best Affiliate Marketing Programs in 2021
It’s finally time to get to the best programs that you can join. All of these are great programs with incredible offers, products, and solid payouts. No matter which one you chose, you won’t go wrong with any of them! 
Amazon Associates
Amazon is one of the biggest names online. Their business model is not only tied to their online store, but they also dabble in marketing, servers, logistics, and many other industries. Knowing all of this makes it not that weird to know that Amazon has one of the biggest and best affiliate programs. 

Affiliates that enroll in their program will be satisfied with the deal Amazon provides them. Currently, you can make 10% of most product sales that were brought by your link. Your affiliate link can work on any purchase on the platform that customers make. The only bad thing is that the cookie will only be active for 24 hours. 
Shopify Affiliate Program
Shopify is one of the biggest eCommerce platforms on the web. So it’s no wonder that they offer a robust affiliate program for its users. The main pros to using Shopify are its potential earnings. You can earn a lot per referral. On average you can earn the first two months of your referrals subscription. Depending on the type of customer, you can make up to $2000! The only real problem is that it’s a very niche affiliate program. Finding the right audience is hard and you will spend a lot of time on each referral. 
Social Champ
Social Champ is a social media management tool that supports all major social media platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, and Google Business Profile. It provides automation solutions for enterprises of all sizes and allows them to can create, edit, design, schedule, track, and monitor all social media posts with multiple amazing features within the tool.
Social Champ has a practical and quite beneficial affiliate program by which one can earn 30% commission with a chance to get an additional $50 bonus. 
ClickBank
ClickBank is a diverse marketplace packed with merchants whose products you can promote. You can pick from products that best match your audience and interests. There are a lot of choices and you should have an easy time picking what you want to run. 

This flexibility and amount of offers are the biggest pros of this platform. Finding what to promote is easy and efficient! But not everything is perfect, there are no digital payment methods, and you can earn a max of $150 per referral sale. This last part is probably the biggest problem as scaling is disincentivized. 
ShareASale Affiliates
With almost two decades of experience, ShareASale is a household name in the affiliate industry. Their reputation is unmatched and most affiliates have a lot of positive things to say about them. Their marketplace is full of merchants that offer a lot of diverse products to promote. 

The platform is flexible in payouts and product selection. Making it perfect for a lot of affiliates in the industry. Sadly the setup process is a bit lengthy and you will need to spend some time to make everything work after you join.

Their dashboard design is easy to use and well designed. AWIN has very competitive commission rates and their support staff is incredible. No matter when you need help, they will make sure to be there for you. 
eBay Partner Network
We all heard of eBay and its platform. eBay itself has over a billion listings for all sorts of products, and for this reason, its Affiliate Program is a popular one in the industry. Their affiliate program is similar to Amazon’s. You get to promote well-known products with high conversion rates. The commission on eBay is usually 50-70% of the auction fees (not the sale price). So if you get a customer to buy something, you should expect to share eBays cut of each sale. 
Impact

FlexOffers is known for its hands-on approach to connecting merchants with affiliates. They help find great offers and get the most out of them.

Conclusion
Finding the right affiliate marketing program for your business might be hard. There are a lot of programs that vary dramatically. Some are better for beginners, some for pros, and some offer a well-rounded experience. Payment methods, commissions, and offer choices can also vary drastically. Picking the right one from thousands of programs is hard, but with lists like these, you can narrow down your choice a bit. 

Before committing to any of these programs, do some research yourself and see what exactly fits you and your use case. Every affiliate has his preferences, so there isn’t one affiliate program that stands out amongst the competition.

8274,"Facebook Conversion API for eCom (Shopify, WooCommerce & others)","We are sure it’s not the first time you hear about the iOS 14 update this year. Apple made the life of those who use Facebook Ads a bit harder. Every advertiser had to find a workaround solution that could help with Facebook conversion tracking and optimization. But how did the iOS 14 update influence the life of eCom store owners, vendors, and publishers? 
In our previous articles, we have been focusing primarily on the consequences of FB CAPI for affiliates. This article is going to explore what Facebook Conversion API means for eCom and direct advertisers. Together we will learn the solutions that can save your FB Ads if you run an eCom business. 
What changed in Facebook conversion tracking? 
We have created a lot of content about privacy updates that influenced changes in Facebook Ads performance. The main reason behind that is iOS 14 update that introduced ATT prompt. This update influenced the way Facebook does conversion tracking &amp; attribution tremendously. 
To learn more about the changes, I recommend watching this video created by our team: 

But in a nutshell, the beloved Facebook Pixel was not able to serve anymore to provide the same results as before 2021. In order to track, analyze and optimize for conversions, you need a new player for the game — Facebook Conversion API. 
Why do you need Facebook Conversion API for eCom? 
Facebook Ads was always one of the main advertising channels for the eCom industry. FB Ads are efficient when reaching your potential audiences with the use of targeting &amp; remarketing. However, Facebook attracts sales (and other target actions) to your eCom store only if you know how to properly use optimization.
Facebook algorithms require the conversion data in order to perform optimization for the events of your choice (sale, add to cart, etc.)
And that’s where many eCom stores face a major problem. The problem starts when trying to deliver the data about conversions (and other target actions) to Facebook. 

Many Shopify / Woocommerce / other platforms users started noticing a huge discrepancy between the real sales happening in their stores and the data that Facebook shows about conversions. 

Previously, everything was pretty easy. You had 10 sales displayed on Shopify, 10 sales shown on the Facebook side. You had your Facebook Pixel solving all the issues you could have while running FB Ads, targeting, and optimizing. However, those times are gone. 
Problems of eCom owners who run Facebook Ads
1. Facebook doesn’t receive all the required data to further use it for optimization 
Facebook Pixel lost its power as a trustworthy way to deliver the data about conversions from the 'thank you' page back to Facebook. Without accurate data, accurate optimization is not possible.
2. Facebook doesn’t show you the exact results of the campaigns as they use modeling 
Facebook is a so-called self-attribution network. That means that Facebook is performing all the tracking and attribution. But do they really want to share that other channels brought you conversions? It’s way easier to keep all eggs in one basket and force you to invest your budgets in FB Ads by making you believe that Facebook brings all the conversions.

Therefore, if you invest bigger budgets in advertising and you are using multiple channels at a time, you really want to know the truth behind your conversions. Only independent tracking &amp; attribution solutions can guarantee you unbiased data. 
3. Shopify (or other eCom platforms) does not show ad spend for the campaigns you are running. 
You see sales on the products you advertise, but you can’t really always connect them to a specific Facebook Ad. Besides, you are not able to see the drop-down of your spending per campaign, ad set, or ad. In that case, your data about results and spends is separated. 
4. eCom store owners need a trustworthy source to make decisions affecting their business. 
In a situation where Facebook doesn’t show exact conversion data and your Shopify does not show the ad spend/revenue, you are pretty much left in a black box, not being able to make decisions based on facts (accurate data). Rather only on guesses. 
Facebook Conversion API solution for eCom
If you want to enjoy the result driven by Facebook Ads and see the sales flowing in your Shopify / Woocommerce / other stores, you need a hand from Facebook Conversion API. But there’s a trick. 

If you go through the problems mentioned above, you realize that there is a real need for an independent unbiased platform that will collect all the data, send the required conversion data to Facebook for optimization, but at the same time will give you accurate insights for your marketing &amp; advertising strategy.

At RedTrack, we adopted a native solution for Facebook Conversion API at an early stage and kept close contact with specialists from Facebook to be sure we can solve advertisers’ issues. 
RedTrack as eCom Facebook Conversion API solution
RedTrack has API-based integration with Facebook. This allows RedTrack to step as an independent platform that, on the one hand, collects data about every click from your source (Facebook) and, on the other, attribute those clicks to conversions (purchases, add-to-cart, checkout, other conversion events) and send back to Facebook via API for further optimization.

With RedTrack, you can: 

 	track your purchases / add to carts / abandoned carts (or other target actions);
 	provide accurate reports on campaign performance;
 	send conversion data back to FB via API; 
 	provide unbiased data about your advertising.

You can use a 14-day free trial to give this solution a try and see if it works for your business objectives.

To start smart FB conversion tracking, you might find this guide of use. It goes through necessary steps to integrate CAPI, also exploring tips &amp; insights from our team on work with Facebook Conversion API.


Conclusion
Facebook conversion tracking after iOS 14 hasn't been easy. However, finding the right solutions helps simplify the pain. If you haven't been able to become friends yet with FB CAPI as an eCom business, consider trying out RedTrack. You can schedule a demo with our team and explore what kind of problems RedTrack will help solving. ",7/8/2021,https://redtrack.io/blog/facebook-for-ecommerce/,eCommerce|facebook ads
8291,Affiliate Marketing for Beginners: Step-by-step guide,"Affiliate marketing is becoming one of the most popular search queries. People from all over the world are trying to enter the industry and make a living from it. It sounds lucrative, simple to do, and easy to start, but the truth is far from ideal. Most affiliate marketers don’t make a significant income, and many give up on a way. Because affiliate marketing is not as easy as you think it is. 

This can only be somewhat circumvented by learning the basics, knowing the rules, and the best practices of the industry. With the proper knowledge, you can make a profit and create some campaigns of value.  For this reason, it is important to know the affiliate marketing basics. Learning how to do affiliate marketing can be a challenge in itself though. But luckily for you,  guides to affiliate marketing like this one exist, so keep reading and you will find out everything you need to start and make it big!
What is Affiliate Marketing
Affiliate marketing has been around for a long time. The business model is simple. There are product owners or merchants, affiliates, and customers. Product owners make their products available for affiliate marketing. They decide, instead of advertising themselves, they will let others advertise for a commission. This commission is usually a percentage of the product price, but the important thing is that it’s only paid out once there is a successful sale. So the merchant is guaranteed to pay only for results. 

People who take up the offer to advertise these products are called affiliates. Affiliates create marketing campaigns focusing on those products to make as many sales as possible and cash out with the commission. For affiliates, the deal is great since they don’t have to worry about customer support, shipping, or anything else product-related. All they need to do is advertise the product in the best way they know.
Affiliate marketing is a commission-based industry. In it, affiliates take over the part of advertisers. They advertise the products that producers or sellers own and they get a commission off each sale.
As you can see this business is quite scalable. The more you manage to sell the more money you will get. For this reason, pro affiliates that know exactly what they need to do and how to do it can make millions in no time. They then advertise their wealth and success to others who try to compete with them. 

What these affiliates don’t advertise is just how much goes into creating a successful affiliate marketing campaign. They rarely explain the marketing basics that people need to know and the numbers show it. In recent years this trend leads to a lot of people trying out affiliate marketing and failing. This gave affiliate marketing a bad reputation. But in reality, all of those people went into the industry without knowing anything. This is why guides to affiliate marketing and learning the marketing basics are so important!
How Much Can Affiliates Make?
Money is always a tricky subject when affiliate marketing comes to mind. Some affiliates make nothing, and some make millions. It’s all about how many campaigns affiliates run and how successful they are. The pros who have been in the industry for years usually make a lot of money. They are experienced and know exactly where and how to advertise the products. Newcomers on the other hand usually make cardinal mistakes and their campaigns make almost nothing. 

The more affiliates improve the more they make. As a beginner, you should hope to make minimum wage in the beginning and transition into 6 figures annually within a year or two. But you will only achieve this if you are actively improving and learning new things. How to affiliate marketing guides should be places where every affiliate starts their journey!
Types of Affiliate Payment Models
When starting affiliate marketing you will see that there are a lot of payment models to pick from. Depending on which one you pick, you will earn your money in different ways. Usually, the rule is, easier models pay out less, while harder models have more commission. Here are some of the most affiliate marketing models that you will find online!



&nbsp;

 	
PPC (Pay-Per-Click)


In this payment, model affiliates get a commission for the clicks that they generate. The clicks themselves don’t have to be sales or leads. This makes this payment model very easy to achieve and is best suited to beginner affiliates. Most likely the commission will be below but you will make them up by volume. 

 	
PPL (Pay-Per-Lead)


Unlike PPC, PPL is a bit harder to achieve. To get a commission from your campaign, you will have to get a lead. Leads are people who show interest in buying some product or service by completing a submission form, trial, sign up, or pre-purchase. 

 	
PPS (Pay-Per-Sale)


Pay per sale is probably the most lucrative option but it’s also the hardest. You will only get commissions once your customer buys the product or service. This is usually reserved for the more experienced affiliates as beginners will have trouble closing the deal. In this model, all of the risks are on the affiliate so merchants love this option the most. 

 	
PPI (Pay-Per-Impression)


Impressions are one of the most common models. In this model, the commission is based on how many people view the ad. It is often referred to as CPM (Cost-per-mille). It is most common with visual ads such as video ads. But there are exceptions to this rule as well.
How to Start Affiliate Marketing
Now that you are informed of what affiliate marketing is, and what some common payment models are, it’s time to learn how to start within the industry.

 	
Step 1: Set up your affiliate status


When starting you will need to find an affiliate network or merchant to do business with. For beginners, the former is usually a better solution as networks are easier to work with. To start, you will only need some personal or business information and a bank account. In turn, you will need to receive an affiliate link for you to get started. 

This affiliate link is the thing that links your work to your results. If your link isn’t working, you will not get accredited for the work that your campaigns are doing. So before starting, always make sure that everything is set up correctly. 

Alongside your affiliate network, you can utilize an array of tools to help you out with your affiliate marketing career. This includes tools like trackers (RedTrack is a great example), Spy Tools (AdPlexity), and a lot of other tools! While these cost some money, they can make you a lot of money through their service, so it’s more of an investment rather than spending. 

 	
Step 2: Find the right niche and product for you!


Newcomers to affiliate marketing think that they will be able to compete with industry veterans with their first campaign. This is almost impossible so beginners should try to find a place for themselves. This is called carving a niche out for yourself. 

You should try finding niches that you are interested in and in which you don’t have massive competition. The less competition, the better. You should focus on that niche almost exclusively. Find products that can best encapsulate your audience and optimize your campaigns the best you can. After you are dominant in your niche, you can try spreading out to other niches, but don’t try spreading too fast as it might be a difficult task. 

 	
Step 3: Build an audience


Your affiliate products are worthless without an actual audience and followers that you can promote those products to. This is why you need to build an audience before starting to run your campaigns. This is usually done by attracting some following through social media or your blog. 

To gain a following, you will need to provide that audience with quality content that will make them read and come back to read more. There are no shortcuts for this. You will have to put some work into it to make all of it work. 

 	
Step 4: Start running campaigns


Here is where the hard work starts. You will need to decide which offers to run through which affiliate networks. You will need to create campaigns for all of these offers. Your campaigns will require landing pages, offer pages, adverts, and much more. You will need to learn how to make eye-catching creatives and write engaging copy. Without doing these two properly your campaigns have no chance of succeeding. 

You can learn a lot of this info by following other guides on affiliate marketing, reading through blogs like this one, or visiting premium affiliate marketing forums like iAmAffiliate!

Most affiliates promote their campaigns through their blogs. Your blogs need to be in a similar niche for this to work. Your audience needs to connect and trust you enough to utilize your recommendations. This is done by providing a lot of value and doing good things for a long time. You need to gain the audience’s trust and if you do it for long enough you can expect to increase your sales drastically. 

 	
Step 5: Optimize everything


Now that you have everything up and running, it is time to optimize everything. Do a lot of A/B testing with your creatives, headlines, and copy. You should soon notice trends in what works and what doesn’t. Continuing to do this can lead you to earn a lot more in the long run. Every campaign needs to be optimized as much as possible. 

Check the audience you are targeting. Find new people and demographics that might be interested. See from which devices you are gaining the most traffic, and consider blocking devices and traffic sources that give you the least conversions. Everything needs to work in harmony for you to ensure that your campaigns are running smoothly.

In this step, you will need the help of affiliate tracking software. It's a special tool that helps track the performance of each of your ads, gathers this data, and allows you to automate &amp; optimize for results. 

We recently released a video with tips on how to choose the best affiliate tracking tool, so check it out before you make up your mind on the solution.

Another important mission that we have at RedTrack is developing the perfect ad tracking &amp; conversion attribution solution ourselves. We have a bunch of features that make lives of affiliate marketers easy and worry-free. If you want to learn more about our product, be sure to use the 14-day free trial.

8410,What is Ad Tracking?! And How to Do it?,"Millions of creatives, copies, designs, tests, brainstorms. It’s very easy to get caught up in a daily marketing routine of constantly trying to create more to achieve those revenue milestones finally.

However, without analysis, the creation sometimes becomes a waste of resources and time. Ad tracking is that one thing that can help you analyze your results to achieve your marketing financial goals. 

But what is ad tracking in reality, how does it work, and most importantly, how can you do it? Let’s open the world of ad tracking in this article. 
What is ad tracking?
Let’s start with some basics and try to decipher what ad tracking really is. 
Ad tracking is a process of collecting various sets of data about your ad campaigns' performance to further use for analysis and improvements in your advertising.
Quite often, tracking has a pretty bad connotation and scares people away. Instead, when we talk about ad tracking from advertisers' side, it's simply a process of collecting data about their advertising efforts. 

Just imagine running multiple campaigns on different channels, with different targeting and a set of various creatives. In order to understand which campaign, ad set, or ad unit brings you conversions, you need to implement ad tracking.



The data you may collect is anything from the origin of clicks and conversions, to advanced drill-down reports on locations, devices, etc.
What can you track with ad tracking? 
As a marketer, you might run a bunch of channels for advertising &amp; marketing. Each channel needs its approach not only in terms of the ads you place but also the way you track it. 

 	Paid Ads (Facebook Ads, Google Ads, Bing Ads, etc.)
 	Partners advertisements (promotion with the help of referrals, affiliate marketing)
 	Direct placement 
 	Programmatic channels 
 	E-mails 
 	SMS campaigns

All of these channels need different approaches but still are a part of the daily marketing routine. But before understanding how to track chosen channels, we need to dig into a few more bites of the theory of ad tracking. I promise we’ll make it as simple as possible.

If you are more of a video type of person, just watch our explanation on what is ad tracking on YouTube ❤️


The principle behind ad tracking is
Before jumping into types of ad tracking or how to track a particular channel, let’s learn the goal of ad tracking and the 'magical components' that make it all possible.
What is the goal of ad tracking? 
The biggest issue that any experienced marketer has is the inability to make decisions based on data rather than guesses when it comes to advertising campaigns and budget allocation. 

To make so-called data-informed decisions, you need real-time and unbiased data. As a marketer you have to find a way to get the data about the following: how, when, and why conversions happen. 

And besides all the cool statistics you receive when doing ad tracking, the core thing you get is connecting the right click to the right conversion.



When you are able to bind the click with the conversion, you are able to gain all the other insights about your advertising. 
Types of conversions you can track 
In the big picture there are only 2 types of conversions:

 	On-web property event or simply online conversion; 
 	Events besides web property — offline conversions (phone call, test drive, delivery, etc. — that’s usually something your CRM should capture).

Our goal is to correctly track both types of conversions and attribute those conversions to the right clicks, campaigns, and ads. Let’s learn what helps do that. 
How ad tracking works
The first thing you need to do is get accustomed to the tracking link. 

Most marketers have worked with tracking links, but let's see what lays behind links and how they really work. 
A tracking link is your link that contains some magical components (tracking parameters) and unique click ID that make matching clicks with conversions (aka tracking and further attribution) possible.
&nbsp;

Let’s disassemble each component in the tracking link one by one. 
1.Tracking (UTM) parameters
Tracking (UTM) parameters are special parameters that compose the tracking link and help group the data from the traffic source to track the clicks. 
UTM parameters were implemented by Google for Google Analytics tracking, but today most tracking systems implemented their own tracking parameters for analytics. 
Example of a tracking link with UTM parameters
https://bootsshop.com?cmpid=5e6c7b85c6565a0001718aa0&amp;sub1={replace}&amp;utm_keyword={keyword}&amp;sub4={adgroupid}&amp;sub5={creative}&amp;sub6={campaignid}&amp;sub8={adposition}&amp;ref_id={gclid}

Everything that goes in {} are tracking parameters: keyword, adgroudID, creative, position etc. 

After a user clicks this link the parameters will be exchanged on real values coming from this particular user: which keyword was used, which ad group the ad corresponds to, the campaign ID, etc.

This way, tracking parameters help group the data about the user click. This data will later be used for matching clicks and conversion and providing you further analytics. 
2. Unique Click ID
Click ID is probably the most significant component of a tracking link. This ID is responsible for saving data about the user creating a unique identifier for their click. 
Click ID is a unique ID that identifies a unique click and helps the tracking systems connect a particular click with conversion while performing attribution. 
If we take that same link we will find a place where a unique click ID will be further saved at the end of the link (highlighted in bold). 

https://bootsshop.com?cmpid=5e6c7b85c6565a0001718aa0&amp;sub1={replace}&amp;utm_keyword={keyword}&amp;sub4={adgroupid}&amp;sub5={creative}&amp;sub6={campaignid}&amp;sub8={adposition}&amp;ref_id={gclid}

Click ID is a unique value and is crucial when it comes to finding out who exactly made the conversion (or any target action that you set). 
3. Script 
To make tracking parameters and unique click IDs work for tracking &amp; attribution, we need another player — script. 


The script activates all the tracking components and helps deliver all the required data to the tracking system for further matching. 
After the user clicks the tracking link, the script first collected tracking parameters from the link, creates a record in a tracking system, generated a unique click ID, and saves everything in a first-party cookie (we will talk about the importance of first-party data tracking a bit later).

The script is usually placed on all the pages of your website that receive traffic. 
The example of how tracking script works
Now let’s see how it would work in reality in the following picture: 



Supposedly you have an initial tracking link that you placed under your banner with shoe promotion. That’s how your initial link looks like: 

https://bootsshop.com?cmpid=5e6c7b85c6565a0001718aa0&amp;sub1={replace}&amp;utm_keyword={keyword}&amp;sub4={adgroupid}&amp;sub5={creative}&amp;sub6={campaignid}&amp;sub8={adposition}&amp;ref_id={gclid}

Then the user clicks on your banner and is directed to your website, but since there were a bunch of tracking parameters, the link is being filled with all the info about the user: tracking parameters are exchanged for the real values, and click ID is being generated in order to store a unique click. 

That’s how the link looks like after the user clicked on it: 

https://bootsshop.com/?cmpid=5e6c7b85c6565a0001718aa0&amp;sub1=D-Banner-Boots-USA&amp;utm_keyword=sport_boots&amp;sub4=117989060862&amp;sub5=woman_in_boots&amp;
sub6=12720532498&amp;sub8=display&amp;utm_term=sport_boots&amp;utm_campaign=D-Banner-Boots-USA&amp;utm_source=adwords&amp;utm_medium=display&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIzomEtO-68gIVAQOLCh2pbAnUEAAYASAAEgIGifD_BwE

After the user has made a purchase on your website, the tracking system that received all the info with help of the script recognized that it was a particular click with ID (EAIaIQobChMIzomEtO-68gIVAQOLCh2pbAnUEAAYASAAEgIGifD_BwE) that made a conversion. And this banner was related to a display ad which was found by the keyword “sport boots”, creative “woman in boots”, etc. 

Why tracking with first-party data?
Earlier everything used to work through cookies and redirects. That’s why you as a marketer might not know all these tracking terms. Redirect worked magic and did all the steps mentioned above within seconds. Redirect was creating a cookie for tracking, generating click ID, and binding the incoming conversions in a time of a single blink. With 1st party data tracking the script and all the fuss around it becomes more visible. However, neither Facebook nor Google allows redirects anymore.

In addition to that, the cookie times are gone, so we recommend not looking to third-party tracking. If you want to learn more about cookieless advertising, check out this video explainer.



How can you do ad tracking?
You need the components listed above: tracking link with tracking parameters, unique click ID, and script to make it work. It doesn’t matter how you find those components.

Usually, novice marketers go for Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager to set it up. Google Analytics requires quite a few bits of tech knowledge to create complex setups; however, it gives a great functionality for core tracking. 

Another way to handle tracking is to use ad trackers. 

Ad trackers simplify it all by creating a script for you, issuing tracking links, and performing attribution (connecting the right clicks with the right conversions).

In order to invest in the right ad tracker, make sure you find these features: 

 	Relies only on first-party data (we discussed the importance above);
 	Gives data breakdowns and provides advanced reports;
 	Supports Facebook CAPI (after 2021 updates);
 	Enables you with automation &amp; optimization (&amp; some other extra functionalities).

Nice to have:

 	Multi-touch attribution: helps build user funnels in order to understand which touchpoint brings you the highest returns 
 	Raw data by click ID: your tracker can store all the data about unique clicks or can create data models. We recommend sticking with raw data, more details will also follow in the next paragraphs. 

How to start doing ad tracking (like a pro) 
Starting ad tracking depends on what kind of events or channels you are going to track. 

Let's take aside the “tech-type” of tracking, but rather focus on the channels that you need to take control over. Let's look at the diagram below to see the full picture of the types of channels and ads you can track. 



To track the performance on any of those channels, you will need tracking links, tracking parameters, and click ID. All of this we learned in previous chapters, so if you skipped the theory, scroll back 🙃
1. Paid Ads (PPC) tracking 
PPC tracking is a way to perform ad tracking on pay-per-click (PPC) channels. We are talking about search ads, display ads, video ads, native ads, remarketing etc. 
Since you pay for each click made on your ads, it’s extremely important to track this advertising to allocate budgets accordingly. 

Even though there can be a ton of channels where you can run your paid ads, we are going to look at the most common examples — Google Ads tracking and Facebook Ads tracking. 

Usually, these are the first places where marketers find a need in ad tracking. Most marketers start from tracking &amp; reporting that Facebook or Google has in their ecosystem: Facebook Ads Manager (+Events Manager) for FB Ads or Google Analytics for Google Ads.
Both Google and Facebook systems work the way we described above. They create unique IDs and add parameters to later find the matched click &amp; conversion inside their analytics tool.

Unique parameter from Google — {GCLID}, Google usually asks whether you want to add it.

Unique parameter from Facebook — {FBCLID}, Facebook just adds it while you blink.

These unique parameters are responsible for sending data back to Facebook or Google to further make all the analytical decisions. 
But, what’s the problem with FB and Google ad tracking systems? 
1) Self-attribution networks
Both Facebook and Google are self-attribution networks. That means that they are the owners of the network where you run ads, as well as they do all the tracking and conversion attribution for those ads. 
To describe it in another way, they take payments for their ad services from advertisers and give them reports on how well their ad campaigns performed. Obviously, they want to give you a very good report and show impressive numbers, so you invest more in their ad services.

Marketers in 2021 prefer to invest in unbiased tools that do not depend on you investing back to their service. So Facebook and Google are not good sources of independent data tracking &amp; attribution because it’s simply in their interest for you to see the bright picture.
2)Usage of data aggregation and modeling
Both Facebook and Google use data aggregation and modeling, rather than using raw tracking data and analyzing it.
In a nutshell, the difference between those methods is the following: 

 	Aggregation and modeling is a sort of a middle-ground with an average value for your advertising effort. It means that you see on your dashboards only the approximate value.
 	Raw data consolidation means that every single click is counted and shown to you in the statistics &amp; analytics. 

If you want to receive raw, unbiased, and independent data while tracking you need assistance from ad trackers which rely on first-party data. At RedTrack, we work on becoming a trusted source of data for marketers. Consider taking a 14-day free trial to see how we can help you. 
Another issue with tracking after iOS14 
However, problems with Google and Facebook do not end here. The latest privacy update by Apple influenced both of the networks, especially their tracking. 
1) Google Ads tracking after iOS14 
Even though many thought that iOS14 influenced only Facebook Ads, it turned out that Google got its shot too. 

Google stopped transferring Google Click ID {GCLID} for iOS14 devices traffic (coming from apps specifically). What does it mean? 

It means that now Google can not receive back the data about clicks and conversion from iOS14 devices, which means that clicks and conversions from YouTube Ads or Gmail (apps from Google ecosystem) can not be tracked. 
P.S. It doesn’t influence your setup if you don’t want to do an offline conversion upload back to Google. 
2) Facebook Ads Tracking after iOS 14
For Facebook Privacy Update by Apple meant a few big changes: 

 	Integration with Facebook CAPI;
 	Transfer to Aggregated Event Measurement (you already understand what aggregated here means);
 	Modeled data in Facebook Ads Manager reports;
 	Breakdowns in reports disappeared.

In order to start working with CAPI, you need the help of a developer or a third-party tool that can figure it out for you. 
But even if you are happy with the DIY CAPI setup, you should keep in mind that you should not expect to see accurate data in the Facebook Ads manager if you have a lot of iOS14 users. 

Below, you can see an example of how we solve the issue with Facebook Conversion tracking at RedTrack.
2. Affiliate/referral tracking
Affiliate/referral program is one of the popular ways to advertise your product with help of other marketers. It means that affiliate marketers will start promoting your product/offer for a small commission (you can set your own payout model). 
Affiliate/referral tracking is a way to track the individual performance of your affiliate marketers, affiliate networks, or simply referral links that promote your product or service.
If you start your own affiliate program, you will need to start affiliate (or referral) tracking. 

What you need as an owner of the affiliate program: 

 	Create tracking links to issue them to your affiliates in order for them to advertise your product or service. 
 	See the reports about the performance of the affiliates (see who performs better or worse in order to issue correct payouts)
 	Present the reports to the affiliates in order to resolve any disputes, as well as to show their results. 

Of course, you do need your magic trio for the tracking link: click ID, tracking parameters, and script to make it all happen. You can either:

 	Issue tracking links yourself (for example with help of GA) and control the performance in spreadsheets;
 	Use affiliate management software that helps create affiliate programs (generate tracking links and run reports for you). 

I expect you to now even think about trying to run an affiliate program in excel and do as most marketers do: invest in affiliate management software (Tapfiliate, Affise, Postaffiiliatepro, etc.).

However, I have a smart tip for you. You can save your resources on the number of tools you use. RedTrack has been known as a go-to tracker for marketers, but we decided to step this game up and developed our own affiliate management system — a White-label partnership portal.

This way you get a chance not only to do all the complex ad tracking &amp; attribution with RedTrack software but to manage affiliates in the same tool (generate links, track affiliate’s performance, use reporting). Minimize the number of solutions that eat your marketing budget with us — book a demo.

3. Influencer tracking 
As one of the most popular marketing methods in the past 5 years has been influencer marketing, a new issue arose — how to track the performance of ad placement within bloggers. 
Influencer tracking is a way of collecting data about the performance of the ads you run with influencers. 
Basically, it’s almost the same process as affiliate (referral) tracking, but we decided to make it a separate point because of the specificity of the platforms you use to track influencers. 

The most popular platform for influencer marketing is for sure Instagram, followed up by TikTok and YouTube.  
How to track influencers on Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube
Usually, you have 2 options when it comes to ad placement with influencers: 
1. Using a tracking link
Instagram allows adding links to stories for influencers who have over 10k followers, so it could be a good option for bigger size bloggers. If your blogger does not have the ability to place a link, you might consider the second option. 
2. Using a promo code 
Promo code is a special code that you can generate for your influencers (e.g. track50off) in order to decipher which influencer brings you sales. 

Or obviously, you can use both: a code and a tracking link.

In order to work with this data you still need a unique click ID, parameters and script in order to use it for analysis. Instagram, as well as YouTube, are great because they allow you to include links with a lot of parameters (which will later help you sort things out by campaign, influencer, etc.). 

However, what you need for successful collaboration with influencers is:

 	Ability to use link shortener without losing the functionality of the tracking hidden in all the parameters that you set 
 	Track the performance of each individual promo code created for each influencer

You can generate links manually, making sure that you do not use dynamic parameters (otherwise the link shortener will break the link) and also manually export the performance on each promo code. 

But also you can use the white-label publisher panel at RedTrack in order to all at once:

 	Create tracking links and issue them to influencers 
 	Create coupons (promo codes) and track their performance (promo codes will be unique for each influencer and human-readable, which is very important for Instagram, Youtube, and TikTok audience)
 	Do proper attribution of each promo code (or link) and connect it to the right influencer
 	Use reports for your convenience and to show results to influencers

4. Direct ad placement tracking
As direct ad placement traffic, we count those banners, links, ads that have been placed directly on a website (whether it’s your own or the websites of those publishers and partners. It can be any website that allows the placement of the banners/links.
If traffic on your own website can easily be tracked with Google Analytics, links on other properties (for example media outlets) have to be tracked.
Why do you need tracking for direct ad placements (beyond the obvious reasons we have discussed)?

Usually, publishers work with several models: 

 	Flat fee. It’s a set fee you pay for your ads being displayed. You pay once and then analyze the results of this placement for your business and if it's worth future investments. 
 	You pay for clicks or impressions. For some weird reason, many publishers use CRMs or simple spreadsheets for reporting. But it’s not real-time data, it can not be verified, and can not be matched with inner system data in case of any discrepancies. Tracking can solve this problem and make payment for clicks/impressions accurate according to real data about conversions. 
 	You pay for results (conversion, sale, etc.). Same deal as in the previous point — you gotta understand the real data behind conversions in order to make sure where they are coming from. Tracking gives you access to real-time data about conversions. 

A new type of tracking, but the same old song — tracking link, parameters, and unique click ID still do the job. 

Tracking parameters are very important for direct placements because you can negotiate with your publisher the structure of the parameters in order to find what, when, and how was shown to the user, as well as any other info about the campaign. 

Usage of tracking tools like RedTrack allows you to issue those tracking URLs for direct placements and take this data to the same dashboard where all the rest of the channels’ reports are stored. Parameters can be both: dynamic or hard-coded. 
Ad Tracking Takeaways 
We do hope that this article sheds some light on the complex topic of ad tracking. Ad tracking can truly become your source of valuable insights that will affect every marketing channels you utilize.

8541,Why do you need Google Analytics Alternative?,"Google Analytics (GA) is a staple for any marketer. When you dig into analytics, GA will come as a first tool to help you out. But is Google Analytics enough if we want to receive proper performance analysis for our website/ads, and other marketing activities or you need a Google Analytics alternative? 

In this article, we are going to explore why GA may be not the best idea and why do you need a Google Analytics alternative. 
So what is it, that Google Analytics lacks? Let’s dive into everything you didn’t know about GA! 

&nbsp;
Why Google Analytics is a go-to marketing analytics tool
1. Google Analytics is a source of information on your website interaction
On the screenshot below you can see that Google Analytics provides you with insights about each page you have on your website. The info comes down to pageviews, time users spend on a page, entrances, bounce rates, etc. 

This feature is great to analyze the performance of each page to understand which part of your website needs more investment of resources. 


2. GA helps define sources that drive traffic to your website.
Google Analytics measures and separates online traffic into channels that define their primary source: whether it’s organic traffic, paid ads, social, email traffic, or others.  


3. With GA you can set goals for your performance 
Google Analytics unlocks the opportunity to track the most important goals and conversions of your website to improve it and track the results of any campaign. With the use of GA, you can track user actions on your website.

4. GA gives data reports with customization. 
Meaning that with GA you can customize your reports, dashboard, alerts to see any data you might possibly need. 

Plenty of pre-made reports help choose a reporting template that suits your needs. You can export your reports to excel or google sheet or other tools. 
5. GA allows issuing tracking links for different purposes. 
Google Analytics along with Google Tag Manager (GTM) gives you an opportunity to create tracking URLs that you can use for ad tracking, for example. With the usage of a few UTM parameters, you can get all the valuable information about the conversion events driven by those links. 

&nbsp;
5 Reasons why Google Analytics is NOT the best solution 
But when we advance as marketers, we start realizing that analytics, eventually, is the key part of your marketing activities. Analytics provides you with data that help you make the decision not relying on guesses, but on actual facts.

Here, you may start noticing that GA is failing to serve its mission. 
1. Analyzing the performance of your media-buying campaigns 
If you do a lot of media buying through different advertising platforms, Google Analytics is not as good as specialized ad tracking software.
GA tends to overreport or sample data without precise accuracy (more on this topic in the following section). 
Moreover, GA doesn’t provide you with as many details about the performance of your campaigns, as you can get from ad tracking software.
2. Automating the performance of your campaigns

Another missing feature that you as a marketer would definitely find a place in your marketing routine is automation and optimization.
GA collects data but has no ability to automate your performance according to this data. 
Ad tracking software gives you the opportunity to set rules in order to optimize traffic. For example, the worst-performing offers will automatically be paused and better-performing offers will receive more traffic. 
3. Running affiliates/referrals/influencers campaigns 
One of the ways to step up your marketing is to create an affiliate program (or use referrals/ influencers) to promote your website or your traffic.
Even though GA gives you an opportunity to create tracking links, analyzing the performance of different affiliates can turn into a nightmare without a unified dashboard. 
You need not only issue links, but compare the performance of your advertising partners and share results with them in order to solve any disputes.  
4. Coupon-based attribution (promo code attribution)
When working with affiliates/referrals or influencers, you may want to issue special promo codes to advertise your product. Google Analytics is not able to perform attribution with those coupons (promo codes) that will lead you to incorrect conclusions about the performance of your referrals. 
5. Offline conversion tracking
And lastly, Google Analytics is not able to record offline conversions that happen on your backed. Like trial periods, demos, or other actions that happen in your CRM (Hubspot, Salesforce, etc.)

What you didn’t know about Google Analytics? 
When many marketers trust GA everything about their marketing, there are 2 things you might not have known about how it really works. 

 	
Google Analytics uses data modeling and aggregation


Sounds scary, but it simply means that Google Analytics doesn’t show you a full picture of your conversion performance. It’s a model of your real clicks, conversions, and impressions which is an average value. 
The average value is great if you wanna see an approximate picture of your performance, but if you want to go real deep into exploring your statistics, you need to understand the backstory for each and every click that comes to your website and product. 
Third-party trackers do offer you that functionality if they use raw first-party data. 

 	
Google Analytics is not so free


We are all used to see GA as a free tool for marketers, however, if you go to their website, you can see that there is an Analytics 360 (with a price available only once you talk to sales). 
Paid GA includes integration with Salesforce, advanced reporting, advanced funnels, advanced attribution modeling &amp; more. 

Basically, paid Google Analytics provides all the features that offer third-party tracking tools. And rumor has it, that most companies wouldn’t be able to afford Analytics 360, but you can talk to sales and see it for yourself.
Moreover, with all the setup required for a proper work of GA (advanced funnels, attribution, etc.), you might miss the hidden costs for developers' services.
When do you need an alternative to Google Analytics?
We have just seen some of the reasons why Google Analytics is a great tool, as well as some issues with GA. 

So GA is great, but not the end to all means solution. Let’s look at the cases where you will need help from other tools, so-called third-party ad tracking software.  

 	
You run a bunch of marketing channels.


PPC, referrals, influencer marketing, direct ad placements, etc. And you want to have accurate and precise data about each channel in a single dashboard. With the ability to see dropdown details on conversion data. 

 	
You run an affiliate program, referral program, or invest in influencer marketing. 


For that purpose, it’s wise to use an affiliate management software that helps you do both: issue special tracking links and track the performance of your advertising partners. 

 	
You want to see the full picture. 


Meaning that for valuable decisions you need raw data about every click and conversion happening on your website. Only tools that support raw first-party data without modeling, sampling, or aggregation can do that. 

 	
You want to automate the performance of the campaigns and let go of the controls of advertising adventures.


Only third-party tracking software will open to you a wonderful world of automation &amp; optimization functionality. Control your traffic with the use of smart algorithms.
 

 	
You have offline conversions as a goal.


Third-party trackers will be able to record those conversions and perform attribution matching data from online events and offline events. 

 	
You need to “stitch the funnel”


For example, identify which of the channels / campaigns generate e-mail subscribers with high LTV and what is the actual ROAS of those subscribers.

Well, let me introduce you to one of the tools that can help you if those activities are a part of your marketing routine.

RedTrack is an ad tracking, conversion attribution, and affiliate management software, all-in-one. It relies only on raw first-party data and helps bring all the data to a single dashboard.

8577,How to Promote Affiliate Links with Native Ads,"As an affiliate marketer, you must be continuously looking for new strategies to promote your links and boost your profits. 

Running Facebook Ads is getting more and more challenging with competition growing rapidly. Moreover, if you have ever taken any affiliate marketing course, you must have been told that keeping all your eggs in one basket is a huge risk for an affiliate. It’s time to add a new strategy to your marketing mix.

Native advertising has become increasingly popular among affiliate marketers for the last few years. But you can still enjoy moderate competition levels and great ROAS if you jump in now. 

Read on to learn more about the advertising approach and get guidance on how to build your first native ad campaigns.

What’s native advertising?
Native advertising is a paid advertising technique that uses ads blending in with the environment where they’re placed. Just like any other advertising method, you can use it to promote your website or run promotional campaigns for specific landing pages.
Native ads are equally effective for boosting brand awareness, building email lists, and driving sales. Of course, affiliate marketers usually focus on selling their products through native ads rather than simply driving traffic or generating leads.

The key peculiarity of native ads is that they’re placed within designated widgets on blogs, news websites, and media outlets. However, they have nothing to do with display ads or banner ads. 

Native ads are also called sponsored content or content recommendations, and they look the following way:



At the top, there are editorial articles marked by the NBC logo. Below, you see native ads by Fiverr and HumanN. The only thing that distinguishes them is the ‘sponsored’ label right below each ad image.
But how do you display your ads on publishers’ websites? 
If you needed to negotiate each placement with a publisher directly, it would cost a lot. Native advertising is made possible by networks that partner with publishers and allow advertisers to run their ads across all the available websites through a centralized solution.

Native ad platforms, like Taboola and Outbrain, function similarly to Facebook Business Manager. To launch a campaign, you add your content, choose targeting options, set bids, and create an ad schedule if necessary. 
Why native advertising is popular among affiliate marketers
So, why is native advertising particularly effective for affiliate marketers?

First of all, it’s less expensive than other popular advertising methods. The average cost-per-click (CPC) for native ads that target mobile devices is $0.3, and the median CPC for desktop ads is $0.6. 

These are the average numbers. You can lower the costs by optimizing your campaigns.

Next, native ad platforms are less restrictive about ad design and landing pages that you can promote. Top-notch networks do have guidelines for sponsored content, but if you follow them, they won’t ban your account out of blue.

On any platform, native ads are checked manually by content review teams, which helps to eliminate random ad rejections. 

Moreover, if you have trouble with getting your product approved by one of the networks, you can always find a platform with less strict policies.

Lastly, native advertising perfectly aligns with affiliate marketing content. The most popular content formats used by affiliates are listings, tutorials, and product comparisons – these are also very common for editorial content that readers of publishers’ websites got used to.
Native ads vs. Facebook ads
Although the process of campaign creation is very similar across Facebook and native ad platforms, there are some key differences between Facebook Ads and native ads:

 	Content formats. Traditional product pages might perform well on Facebook, but not on native. Readers of publishers’ websites behave differently than paid social users (even though these are the same people). You need to provide content that entertains or educates and – only after visitors are hooked – converts. That’s why pre-sell pages are so common among native advertising experts. Before putting the core offering in front of visitors’ eyes, they drive them to a page with an introductory video, quiz, or a how-to article. As an affiliate marketer, you’ll find this approach extremely effective.
 	Targeting. You might have got used to granular targeting on Facebook. If you want to start with native advertising, you should forget about it. You can access interest-based and lookalike audiences on native ad platforms, but it’s typically better to go for broader targeting. How will you filter out irrelevant audiences? There’s a simple solution: your ad creatives will do that for you. Be specific about what’s on your landing page, and you won’t get clicks from the wrong people.
 	Ad creatives. One more important aspect is the way ad creatives look on Facebook and on publishers’ websites. Facebook allows for really long ad copies. Who needs a pre-sell page when your ad copy can be used to fully cover the topic, right? Native ad platforms typically support headlines up to 100 characters. It means you should do your best to present the key message of your campaign in one sentence. No clutter – straight to the point.

3 affiliate marketing campaigns promoted with native ads 
We’ve already said many affiliate marketers are already enjoying the benefits of native advertising. Here are some of our favorite native ad campaigns containing affiliate links.
Underscored
Underscored is CNN’s resource for tech reviews, lifestyle tips, and eCommerce product recommendations. In their guides, you’ll find a lot of contextually relevant affiliate links.

To increase traffic and conversions, the Underscored team runs multiple native advertising campaigns. Below you see an example of a native ad and landing page used within one of the campaigns. 



In the actionable guide on making cold brew coffee, relevant recommendations on products that facilitate the process look natural and not forced.
NerdWallet
Nerdwallet is an affiliate site for financial product reviews.

They successfully use one of the most effective approaches to native advertising, which is promoting interactive calculators.



Quizzes and calculators are great for attracting audiences in the decision stage of the buyer’s journey and direct them right towards the checkout.

In this campaign, the advertisers have used a very descriptive headline that appeals to a very specific audience segment. By posing a pre-qualifying question and including a clear CTA, they set the right expectations with people who click on the ad.
SheKnows
SheKnows is a lifestyle magazine that monetizes content by including affiliate links in articles.

The campaign below shares the best methods for waking up refreshed, and one of them is – surprise-surprise – using Sleep &amp; Shine’s supplement. 



&nbsp;

The campaign is promoted across other publishers’ websites and fits perfectly with the environments it’s placed in.
How to sell your affiliate products with native ads
These were the native ad examples by some of the most successful affiliate websites. And how can you make native advertising work for you?
Analyze other advertisers in the niche
Before you start, check out how and whether your competitors are doing native advertising.

You can find their campaigns with the help of a competitive intelligence tool, like Anstrex or PowerAdSpy. Just search for their brand names or keywords they might be using in ad headlines and bookmark the most remarkable examples.

Pay attention to the types of content they promote, campaign messaging, ad headline formulas, publishers they get the biggest portion of traffic from, etc. This information will help you to build a basic structure to build your future campaigns. As you gain insights into the performance of your campaigns, you’ll be able to test different approaches and develop your own style.
Zero in on engaging content
Forget about boring product pages if you want to make native advertising work for you. 

The following content types will help you to get visitors hooked and introduce your affiliate products naturally:

 	Pre-sell pages
 	Customer stories
 	Video tutorials
 	Product comparisons
 	Listings
 	Seasonal content
 	Quizzes
 	Calculators
 	How-to articles
 	Influencer-driven content

These content formats allow you to capture prospects’ attention and move them down the funnel right to the purchase decision. Of course, you should also keep your content relevant to the offers and avoid topics that are too generic. 
Create ads that blend in with the editorial environment
Just look at some of the best native ad examples. All of them use real photos of people or objects being promoted. 

Publishers rarely use graphic illustrations as thumbnails. And if you don’t want your ads to be mistakenly recognized as banner ads, try to avoid banner-like imagery and illustrations.

Same works for ad headlines. Most commonly, editorial content is associated with the following headlines:

 	X Reasons you haven’t done something yet
 	Here’s how you can do something without paying a fortune
 	Are you experiencing some problem? Experts offer the following solution
 	X Cheap tools a famous actress recommends

For instance, instead of promoting a headline that says ‘A keyword research tool all SEO experts are using,’ you might want to go for something like ‘Want to brand new website on Google? Here’s what you need.’
Go away from granular targeting
Remember we’ve said you should avoid getting too granular with targeting on native ad platforms? This is just another reminder.

To realize the full potential of broad targeting, follow these steps:

 	Always split your campaigns by device. It allows you to create different bidding strategies for separate campaigns as desktop traffic is typically more expensive.
 	Consider building separate campaigns for iOS and Android traffic. 
 	If you run campaigns for multiple markets, always target different countries with separate campaigns.
 	Pre-qualify your audiences by calling them out in ad headlines.

Give your campaigns some time 
Native ad campaigns won’t show positive results overnight. It will take weeks or even months to build a stable setup that drives good performance. 

With this in mind, stay patient and persistent. It’s also worth mentioning that reducing your budget dramatically ‘to test the waters’ won’t work. At the end of the day, you’ll have a bunch of campaigns that haven’t managed to drive quality traffic (because of low budget and bids) and have hardly delivered any conversions.
Keep track of performance on the publisher level
One more way to keep control of the type of audience that sees your ads is by carefully examining the websites your ads are displayed on. 

After you launch your first campaigns, you’ll get access to the publisher-level performance report. It often happens that some websites drive a lot of clicks that result in zero conversions. Watch out for those sites and exclude them once you identify performance issues.

Sometimes, it’s also a good idea to check websites manually if you aren’t sure about the publisher quality. Visit sites you’re concerned about and see whether there’s any chance your audience reads them or not.
Launch new tests regularly
What’s most important, don’t limit your campaigns to 2-3 ads and one landing page. You’ll need to combine dozens of headlines and images before you identify a handful of creatives that catch the attention of the right people. 
Important: Every time you want to test a new variable – be it a headline, image, or landing page – create a new campaign. For creative tests, pick 6-10 versions of a headline you think might work and mix them with 1-2 images. Check the campaign performance every day and pause ads that perform poorly (low CTR &amp; conversions). The test is considered successful when you finally identify 1-2 ad creatives that drive high CTR and have the potential of becoming cost-effective as a result of the consistent optimization effort.
It’s time to boost your profits
This is how you get started with native advertising. If you’re ready to explore a new advertising channel and build a strategy from scratch, you’ll rely less on the approaches you’re using now and boost your profits. 

To get started, take these simple steps:

 	Pick a native ad platform;
 	Create content specifically for native ad campaigns;
 	Follow our tips on the campaign setup;
 	Keep track of performance and exclude irrelevant publishers;
 	Always test new variables within separate campaigns.

How to keep track of the performance of your native ads? 
As with any other paid ads channel, a tracker is a must for data analysis and consolidation. How many clicks do your ads get? Which creative converts better? Which geo works better? If you are using the right ad tracking &amp; conversion attribution software all these questions will find answers.
RedTrack is one of the examples of top-notch marketing analytics software that help you make smarter advertising decisions in your marketing routine.

8596,How to prepare eCom store for Black Friday,"As marketers we know, starting October and up until January there will be no rest — the holiday season (Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and Christmas sales) is just around the corner. As online sales have become the primary way for consumers to shop, the competition between online stores grows. How to make your eCom store stand out from all of the products that you can find on the internet these days? 

As an eCom store owner, you need to make sure that not only your products are great, but that all of your advertising campaigns are nicely crafted, scheduled, and tracked. The earlier you start your preparations, the bigger profits you will be able to secure. 

Therefore, let’s go over all the little tricks and advice to make sure your eCom store thrives during Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and Christmas sales season!
Planning your BFCM campaigns for eCommerce 
One of the first things you have to take care of when getting ready for the Black Friday season is planning. Creating a step-by-step advertising plan for you and your team is crucial if you want to save money on media buying and make sure you do not miss any of the sales in the season.

Let’s start with understanding the endpoint. Black Friday in 2021 is on the 26th of November. Cyber Monday — 29th of November.
When are you going to have a rest? That I don’t know for sure :) 

via GIPHY
Ideally, you should have started your preparation like a month ago, but if you are just reading this article, let’s start planning things for both October and November. 
Preparations for eCommerce Black Friday 
When it’s 2 months left until Black Friday it’s a perfect time to prepare your advertising campaigns and test them in order to receive insights that you will need when the rush starts. Also if you start early, you also win on getting cheaper CPMs on paid ads channels, cheaper deals with influencers, and just less stress. Less stress is crucial here. 

 	
Make sure your website is ready for Black Friday sale


Not only your website has to be speedy not to create a distraction for attracted users, but it also needs to have a clear UI. You need to make sure that those leads coming from paid ads channels will end up purchasing your products. Since the competition during the holiday season is high, the attention span for a regular user shrinks at a terrifying speed. 
Make sure that your UI is simple and actually helping a user to make a purchase, not confusing them even more. 

 	
Create a detailed plan for Black Friday advertising campaigns


Use a calendar and plan out every campaign you plan to launch through October and November. It’s a good time to craft all the creatives for your campaigns as the design process may take a lot of time from your team. Be sure to have multiple options for all of your campaigns to test them later and find winning combinations




 	
Diversify your channels for Black Friday advertisements 


Facebook Ads brings a lot of comfort to all eCom store owners, but there’s a world beyond FB, I promise. Not only you can consider other paid ads channels (like Google, Bing, TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, etc.), but you can also invest in partnership marketing. 

By partnerships, I mean methods like affiliate marketing, influencer marketing, any other collaborations you can come up with. We will talk about partnership marketing for eCommerce a bit more below. 

 	
Testing time before the Black Friday rush starts 


While you start running BF campaigns, you may as well use this time for testing and receiving valuable insights about your campaigns. Which creatives convert? What kind of leads do your campaigns generate? 
A great idea for PPC advertisement during October would be a gift guide. This way you will be able to get access to the potential audience to whom you can later retarget your actual products. Gift guides may contain all the uncommon gift ideas, including the promotion of some of your products. But don’t focus it just around you, try to create something that would be genuinely interesting to people. 


Example from Business Insider


 	
Implement ad tracking to your marketing routine


If you haven’t started proper ad tracking (expanding from Google Analytics and FB BM) yet, it’s the right time. The setup for the whole thing may take some time, so the earlier you start, the better. It will open for you a world of insights about every marketing channel you utilize (more about ad tracking in the following chapters). 
How to utilize partnerships for eCom during Black Friday 
As I mentioned above, partnership marketing can become your salvation when it comes to ever-increasing CPMs on paid ads. The amount of ads that any user will see during November is crazy, so you do need to win the attention fight somehow. 
Scaling eCom with partnership marketing

 	
Starting an affiliate program


One of the ways to delegate the promotion of your offers is by doing it through affiliates. Affiliate marketers are sort of freelance marketers that can advertise your product for a commission (with any model: fixed, RevShare, CPA, etc.). The best part of it, that you don’t pay until the actual target event happens, so for eCom, it is a purchase. Once the purchase is done and you track it down to a particular marketer, you are doing the payout according to the agreement (e.g. RevShare 5%). Make sure to check our guide on how to start an affiliate program for eCom. 

 	
Doing referral marketing (multi-level marketing)


Referrals are actually almost synonymous with affiliate marketing. But if you start an affiliate program, you might need to put a lot of work into describing the conditions, negotiating with affiliates, controlling the advertising they are doing, referral links can become a simpler option to get more traction. 
A Referral link is basically a tracking link that leads a customer to your product, but also defines who exactly brought the conversion. You can hand in referral links to influencers or any other advertising partners you have. Based on the referral link, the referrer will get a commission from the purchase (just like in the affiliate program).
Pay attention to the fact that you can also start multi-level marketing if using the right software. Some of the tools allow going several levels doing referrals. Meaning that every referrer you are collaborating with can attract other referral partners.

Actually, at RedTrack we make multi-level marketing (MLM) possible by giving you the opportunity to do referrals for as many levels as you wish, establishing payouts accordingly. If you wish to know how it all works, I recommend talking to one of our tech specialists. 

 	
Working with influencers


Probably the most popular marketing method in the last couple of years, but I know that many eCom owners believe that it’s pricy and not always worth it. Well, what about trying to focus not only on Instagram or YouTube influencers? 

TikTok is a great platform where you can find influencers at a lower price. Not only do you get a great partnership deal, but also you receive all the benefits of TikTok algorithm which works wonders for promoting the content to the right audience. 

The best idea is to use every advertising platform (Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok), depending on the size of your store. The more platforms and influencers you use — the more coverage your products are going to have for various audiences.

When working with influencers it’s crucial to have both: tracking links and promo codes activated. Because you need to evaluate the actual conversions coming from each influencer. Especially if the model that you chose for payment is not a flat price, but payment depending on the amount of brought purchases. 

It’s very important to do a correct attribution for those leads coming from influencer channels: attribute by tracking links or doing the so-called coupon-based attribution (attribution according to the promo codes). 

At RedTrack we offer not only an ad tracking functionality but also a Partnership Portal which simplifies for advertisers affiliate programs, referral marketing, and manual work with influencers. 


How to track the performance of your campaigns during Black Friday 
Many eCom owners and marketers pay a lot of attention to creatives for advertising campaigns, but don’t do a proper job when it comes to tracking.
Ad tracking is actually the key element that will make all of your effort work because it will equip you with data for better decisions. 

So where do you start tracking? How do you analyze the result? How do you improve campaigns? 
Ditch Facebook Business Manager 
As we already mentioned earlier, many eCom owners focus too much on FB marketing. It’s not a bad thing, but there are many other advertising channels for you and your products to be seen. When you start growing the number of channels you advertise on, you will need a proper ad tracking &amp; conversion attribution solution. 

Why? First of all, you need to take all of your advertising channels to one dashboard to compare them and to see all costs and profits in one place. 

Not only you will receive one dashboard combining data for every channel you are using, but you also get the ability to see more dropdown metrics (depending on the software you are using). 

For example, in RedTrack you can choose to see all of the metrics that are so important for any eCom store: clicks, EPC, keywords, ad sets, CR, add-to-carts, abandoned carts, purchases, as well as see the revenue from your campaigns. 

Another important issue that we don’t talk enough about is the way Facebook (or Google) processes data — it samples it. It means that you see only the approximate picture, but not the actual values for each and every click or conversion. Ad tracking software usually allows you to see the reality by logging every event that happens with your advertisements. 
Shopify — Facebook — Tracking integration
It’s important to unite your Shopify/Woocommerce (or another eCom platform) with advertising networks (like Facebook, Google, etc.), but also unifying all the data in the ad tracking system. 

You should have already faced issues with non-matching reports on Shopify and Facebook, and that’s a problem for every eCom owner. 

When you integrate both Shopify and FB/Google in your ad tracking software, it allows you to see more accurate data and send everything to the advertising network accordingly.
By the way, at RedTrack we are currently working on a native Shopify App which will simplify all the hustle around tracking &amp; attribution for Shopify users, making integration with Shopify a one-click process. Stay tuned for updates or just drop your email here to be notified first! 
Campaign metrics for Black Friday to pay attention
Pay special attention to the following metrics while running advertising campaigns for eCom (especially in October):

 	
Cost per click

 	
Click-through-rate

 	
Cost per unique add to cart 

 	
Cost per checkout 


Final words for your eCom advertising activities for Black Friday 
Well, I know it’s a very overwhelming season. But now you have a chance to get a very high reward for all the efforts that you do and reach new financial milestones for your business. 
Before stressing out, I recommend doing a few breaths and following the plan that we presented for you above. 

Remember that careful planning, backed up by marketing analytics solutions will bring you the fruits you were looking for. Don’t forget to implement ad tracking &amp; conversion attribution with specialized software that will be able to become a trusted marketing partner. 
Start your subscription from a 14-day free trial (no CC required) to test the full potential of the platform.

8625,Affiliate Marketing with Facebook Ads in 2024,"In recent years Facebook has become the world's largest social media site. With more than 1 billion users, it is a great platform to promote your business, personality, or anything else. Facebook advertising takes advantage of this popularity by allowing advertisers to reach people who are interested in their products or services.

One can use Facebook ads for affiliate marketing purposes by targeting specific audiences and demographics that are likely interested in the product you're promoting (e.g., running shoes) or the service you provide (e.g., web design). 

All of this makes Facebook a platform that many in the affiliate marketing industry love to work with and create incredible campaigns on. This article will explore how one can use Facebook ads for affiliate marketing purposes and what the best practices are to ensure incredible campaigns. 
What Is Facebook Affiliate Marketing?
Facebook affiliate marketing is just like any other form of online advertising. With Facebook, you pay the network money to bring them traffic. 
The key difference here lies in what happens after that visitor gets to Facebook's website, or your website if you're using it as an affiliate link-generator.

With Facebook, its users are often already logged in. After they click your ad, Facebook can track their behavior on the website you send them to, whether that's an affiliate link or not. This means if someone clicks an ad pointing to ClickBank (or CJ, AvantLink, ShareASale, etc.), Facebook has the power to see what products the user goes on to buy within that network.

When a user makes a purchase, Facebook will record the lead and pass it along back to the affiliate program. They pay you for your original click if your ad yields a sale.

This is why Facebook ads are generally best when targeting existing customers rather than cold audiences off Facebook, who have no brand affinities or affinities with any affiliates.
Methods to Promote Affiliate Offers on Facebook
The first thing you need is a general idea of how to set up your ads and run them. 



Now that you have established how to utilize Facebook ads for your affiliate marketing purposes, here are the methods to use.
1. Use Image Ads to Promote Affiliate Offers on Facebook
Image ads perform much better than banner ads on Facebook so it is best to try and include them in your campaign rather than neglecting them. As we all know, we live in a content-rich world, so every rich media type will perform better than pure text ads. 

People usually respond better to actual images rather than text in Facebook ads because an image can convey a message in much less time. This means that you only have the user's attention for less than 5 seconds when they land on your ad before they decide if they're interested or not—and you need all the help you can get in this department!
2. Use Facebook Ads to Promote Offers on Other Websites
If you're promoting offers on other websites such as ClickBank, it is always a good idea to use Facebook ads in conjunction with these promoted offers on the other sites. You want to have your affiliate offer pointing towards that website. Instead of just having a banner on that site, you're going to have Facebook ads pointing the target website's affiliate link towards it.
3. Use Text Ads to Promote Affiliate Offers on Facebook
Text ads also allow you to add a call-to-action button so if you want your ad to link directly to the product page, this is what you want to use. Text ads do not have a 240 character limit on Facebook, unlike image ads. However, they are generally more expensive than image ads.
4. Use Video Ads to Promote Affiliate Offers on Facebook
People love video content these days because it's entertaining and informative at the same time. This is why you should consider using video advertisements as well as image and text ads on Facebook. You can include a call-to-action button in the video to direct people to the offer page.

One great benefit of using video ads is that Facebook allows you to customize the video length; however, you should keep it short and snappy!
5. Use Mobile Ads to Promote Affiliate Offers on Facebook
This is currently one of the best tactics you can try. As much as 75% of Facebook users access their accounts through mobile devices and if your target audience happens to fall within this category, you should be using mobile ads as well.

If you want people to respond specifically to your offer, it is best to include the call-to-action button in the ad so that users can take action immediately upon landing on your page. You'll notice that Facebook has a limit of 2MB for image and video ads and only 1MB for text ads. That's because Facebook uses mobile devices with low memory to display these types of ads.
6.Targeting and Placement of Facebook Ads for Affiliate Marketing
To make sure you get the most out of your ads, use Facebook audience insights to determine which users to target and where they are most likely to see your posts. This is a crucial step to affiliate marketing on Facebook.  You can find audience insights under each Facebook ad campaign.
Examples of How to Generate Leads
The following is a list of some of the best ways that you can generate leads using Facebook ads. Note: these are just examples, it doesn't mean they will work for you. But if you think about it, this concept applies to just about any affiliate marketing program.


1. Brainstorm New Ideas 
The best way to come up with something that works is by thinking of your ideas first. If it's something you would be interested in buying, chances are other people will too. You can always verify this by checking out the Clickbank marketplace or even Googling it.
2. Facebook Retargeting 
Retargeting is when you reach back out to people who have already visited your website but left without converting into a customer (buyer). You can go into Facebook ads manager and create an ad with the Facebook pixel installed on your site. This will allow you to see the people that visit your website. Then, you can create an ad that sends them back to the product page to get them to convert into a sale.
3. Facebook Video Ads 
Facebook video ads are quickly becoming one of the most popular types of ads out there. Social media users love to watch videos on their newsfeeds because they break up all the text that is on there. As long as the video is interesting enough, you are sure to get clicks.
4. Facebook Ad Campaign Length 
One of your main goals should be to find out how long someone stays engaged with your ad before they decide not to click it anymore. If it's too short, you might need to shorten the video or scale back on all of the copies you're using. If it's too long, maybe try adding some subtitles to keep their attention.
5. Facebook Ad Placement 
You can place your ads directly on people's news feeds or you can send them to another website (such as Clickbank). Either way is fine, but I recommend having a website to track the performance of your ads. You can do this by using a service like Clickbank or Facebook pixel, which will allow you to see how many sales you're getting from every ad campaign you run.

There are many ways you can generate leads, but these are some of the most popular ones. What you should do is research the topic a bit more, test these methods out, find a couple of your own, and see what works best in your case. 
Pros and Cons of Facebook Affiliate Marketing
Pros:

 	It's very easy to get started. All you need is a Facebook ad account and some good targeting ideas.

 	You can use a service like ClickBank to easily search for affiliate marketing offers in any niche.

 	There are a large number of Facebook groups that you can join and share your ads to get more clicks/sales. Lots of big affiliate marketers hang out in these groups, so it's always a good idea to try them out.

 	You can run Facebook ads on the cheap. It's very possible to start this as a side business and make some decent money off of it without spending too much money on ads.

Cons:

 	Facebook is taking away attention from publishers, so there are fewer likes/shares/comments happening online. If an ad has good copy/humor, people are more likely to react to it.

 	Facebook is constantly making changes to its advertising platform. Because of this, you might have trouble running Facebook ads for an extended amount of time. However, the good news is that there are always new ways to promote affiliate offers on Facebook, so it's never too late to start

 	You have to keep experimenting with Facebook ads to find out what works best for you. It's not as simple as working with Google Adwords, but it can still be very useful.

Facebook Ads tracking for affiliate marketing
Ever since the iOS 14 update took place, things changed for affiliate marketers who use Facebook Ads as an advertising channel. It got hard to track the results of the campaigns, report conversions, and keep the performance everybody loved.

As a solution, Facebook Conversion API came along. Without integrating Facebook CAPI you won't be able to track your ads to make conclusions about its performance. However, as affiliate, you might have a few more additional problems with CAPI.

First, you have to be able to verify your domain (affiliate landing page), in order to do that, check out an in-depth guide.
Also, you need to use trusted tracking software to connect your Business Manager with Conversion API. A go-to solution for affiliate marketers is provided by RedTrack.io. It's an ad tracking &amp; conversion attribution tool that helps set up CAPI, verify domains, analyze and automate performance.
Subscription starts with a 14-day free trial, so make sure to give it a try. 
Conclusion
Facebook affiliate marketing is a good choice in 2021. It's always changing, but that just means there are new ways to get conversions all the time. Using tracking allows you to find out what works best for your campaigns and actually brings high-paying results. Just take it one step at a time and I guarantee you'll find success with this method!

 Facebook ads are very picky with the ads that they allow, so you have to be careful in order not to get your account suspended. It can take some time to figure out what works best in your situation, but it's possible if you put in the work.

8647,What’s wrong with Facebook conversion tracking & attribution? ,"There’s no need to state again that from the beginning of 2021 Facebook conversion tracking and attribution got messed up. Facebook needing to adapt to cookieless advertising ended up creating a couple of sleepless nights for us, marketers. 

One of the most popular concerns we have witnessed was the increase in Organic conversions which didn’t seem to be just right. That’s because one of the most popular scenarios for after iOS 14 FB conversion tracking has not been paid attention to. 

Let’s find out the reason for this conversion discrepancy. 
Facebook conversions do not match 
As a Facebook or Instagram user (on your mobile device), you definitely face the following scenario: 
You see an ad — click on it — the ad opens through the Facebook mobile version (here it gets uncomfortable) — you open the ad in Safari (or another browser). 


In this case, most of the tracking software will recognize conversion coming from this click as organic, as Safari blocks third-party cookie tracking by default. 
If you witnessed a lot of conversions for your business coming from Organic source and it just didn’t feel right, here’s the answer. You simply lacked cross-browser attribution in your conversion tracking adventure. 
How to do accurate Facebook conversion attribution? 
There are a couple of features you’ll need to make sure that your Facebook conversion will satisfy you. 
1. Support cross-browser attribution
As we described above, this feature makes it possible to do a correct attribution in the scenarios when click and conversion happen in different browsers. 
2. First-party data based
Coming back to the fact that after iOS 14 the game for Facebook has changed, your tool has to rely only on first-party data. Otherwise, the browser will be blocking any tracking activity. 
3. Raw non-aggregated data 
We’ve talked about aggregation a lot lately. But in a nutshell, aggregated data is a model of your actual conversions, an average value for every activity that happens to your conversions. On a contrary, if you want to have accurate attribution, you need raw non-aggregated data. This means that you need to have info about every single click and conversion that happens on your website.

Learn all the myths and truths of Facebook conversion tracking &amp; attribution in our latest video!

What is Smart Attribution by RedTrack?

Smart attribution covers those 3 essential features described above: cross-browser, based on non-aggregated first-party data. 
This feature makes your Facebook Conversion tracking still possible after Privacy Updates and blockage of third-party cookies.

8704,eCommerce Marketing Strategy in 2023: Top 5 Tips,"By this year, the global eCommerce industry has been expected to reach a whopping $4.89 trillion. If you're looking to increase your companies sales, chances are you're going to contribute to this number and skyrocket in the revenue.

We've created a guide that will tell you what eCommerce marketing is and provide you with some tips to create an eCommerce marketing strategy that will blow your competition out of the water.

Are you ready? Let's go!
What is Ecommerce Marketing?
If you have an eCommerce store, you will need a marketing strategy to promote your products and sales; this is called eCommerce marketing. The best way to ensure that you increase your eCommerce sales is through a mixture of offline and online strategies.
Without using both, you're going to miss out on a segment of consumers that you need and don't want to ignore. As we continue on this eCommerce marketing journey, you must think about all facets of the sales funnel and create an eCommerce marketing strategy that benefits each.

If you want to get your fit in the door and maintain your competitive advantage, it's essential to take your eCommerce marketing strategy seriously.
If you need more e-commerce inspiration, check out our latest e-commerce series on YouTube — Figure{It}Out!


&nbsp;
How to Build Ecommerce Marketing Strategy?
As we move forward, it's time to create an eCommerce marketing strategy that consumers in your niche have never seen, but will flock to. As you design your strategy, there are several things you need to do.
Define your unique selling proposition (USP)
This is what's going to let potential customers know what you're selling and how it benefits them. Ensure that your proposition gives a unique angle that no one has ever taken before.

USP is what makes your eCommerce store stand out, states why users should choose you over your competitors.

Your proposition should answer such questions as to why your product is different, why consumers should settle for your offer, what is unique about your product?
Let's take a look at the NorthFace example of USPs.

&nbsp;

As you can see, they position their products as ""more than just a piece of clothing"". Viewing those banners you associate jackets with something long-lasting, universal, and adjustable. And no wonder, that when you think of an outdoor clothing brand, NorthFace is one of the first names that come to our mind.
Create a mission statement
From there, you must create a mission statement that reflects the goals and values of your company. When people see your brand, your mission statement should come to mind and be reflected in everything from packaging to marketing.

A great example is a mission stated on Nike's website: Bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world. 
&nbsp;



Don't be scared to strive for an ambitious mission. Even if you are just starting out, the mission reflects the whole path you are heading. So don't settle for less, choose the path you actually wanna take.
Define target audience
Next, you need to define your target audience, the people who will be using your products. If you don't know your target audience, you can't create a strategy worth launching.

As we will discuss later on, understanding your target audience will help you select proper marketing channels, advertising strategies, and even creatives. So not choosing the right platform can cause issues in the long-term success of your marketing campaigns.

Define key performance indicators (KPIs) for your eCom store
To finish crafting your marketing strategy, have a list of key performance indicators to monitor and make changes as necessary.

KPIs for eCommerce are special metrics that help you measure the results of marketing &amp; advertising efforts and understand if you are moving to the right direction towards your financial milestones. 
Depending on the type of business you are running and your goals, KPIs may differ, but here are some metrics we recommend to look at:

 	CTR (click-through rate) — how many users clicked on your ad.
 	CPC (cost per click) — how much does every click cost for you.
 	CR (conversion rate) — how many users converted from your ads.
 	Add-to-carts rate  — how many users added to the cart.
 	Abandoned cart rate — the percentage of users who left the website after adding to the cart without purchasing.
 	Cost per unique add-to-cart — how much does every unique add-to-cart cost for you.
 	Check out rate — rate showing how many users end up buying.
 	Cost per check out — showing you how much you pay in advertising budgets for each check out.
 	CLV (customer lifetime value) — what you customer brings you over the whole period of interaction with your store.

Once you start marketing, you can adjust the chosen metrics that will suit you better.

&nbsp;
What Marketing Channels You Should Use in Ecommerce
When it comes to the channels that should be used for eCommerce, you've got to ensure you choose the right one. When you're selecting a channel that meets your company's needs, you need to choose the one where your target audience spends the majority of their time.

Sometimes that means one channel, and other times it means a combination of several channels to push your companies message. Below you'll find some details about each channel.
Organic Traffic
Organic traffic is when customers discover your site based on the keywords you've used throughout your site, content, and across your brand's social media channels. From the search engine pages, consumers discover your site and move forward with finding out what your brand is about and how it can help them.

If you're looking to increase your organic traffic, you must take time to review your site to ensure that you've optimized where possible. Another way to increase organic traffic is investing in content marketing: creating articles, videos or other formats of content that could be looked for by your target audience. 
Paid Traffic
Another form of traffic is paid traffic, which means all the ads you've paid for to advertise your companies products and services. You can use several platforms to launch these ads (like Facebook, Google, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, etc.) and again the channel you choose should correspond to your target audience. Probably one of the most popular channels for advertising within eCom industry would be Facebook Ads or Google Ads. Both of them have advantages and disadvantages, so make sure to learn the benefits of both FB and Google Ads in advance.
Once you chose your PPC traffic channels, you will have to invest in ad tracking to know which ads bring you the most value and reduce the budget spends on unprofitable channels and ads. 
Social Campaigns
Think of social campaigns as social media, which means all traffic to your site when potential customers visit your social media pages. You can boost your social media with paid traffic (described above), but also carefully crafted SMM strategy can bring a lot of visitors to your store. 

With people staying on social media for upwards of 145 minutes a day it can be used to increase your organic traffic based on the different types of posts you put on your social media pages.
Just make sure to create visually aesthetic brand on your social media and warm up the engagement. 
Email Marketing
300.4 emails are sent and received by people regularly, making email marketing a strong channel to use. This channel encompasses all the traffic your site receives through information emailed to your consumers.

You could use newsletters or confirmation emails to further your message and thank customers for shopping with you. Ensure that you find a way to personalize your emails as if you're speaking directly to the customer and no one else.
Once the customer's email is in your database, you have a great way to keep the communication going, but don't overuse it and make user unsubscribe by spamming them with a lot of letters. 
Display traffic
Display traffic is when you place ads for your business on other sites. When potential customers click on these ads, it will bring them to your site.

Usually, there are two types of this traffic: 

 	Banner Ad — the other website puts a banner with a promotion of your offer. Many outlets do it according to the predefined flat fee or on a commission basis.
 	Referral link — it could be a link in article, comment section (or pretty much everywhere) that backlinks to your website.

Affiliate marketing
The last channel we are going to touch today is affiliate marketing which is also considered to be a third-party marketing method as it means attracting other marketers to advertise for you.
The best part of affiliate marketing is that you pay on a commission basis. Meaning that unless marketers makes sales, they won't be earning payouts and you as a eCom store owners will not be spending anything.
You can either hire solo affiliate marketers that will be using affiliate links (that's the way to know that this marketer brought the conversion) or make it official and start an affiliate program.
You can learn more on how you can use the powerful tool of partnerships through affiliate marketing (and not only) in the following video:

5 eCommerce Marketing Tips to Increase Online Sales
We understand you've taken in tons of information at this point, but we're not done providing you with need-to-know details. It's time to give you some tips that are going to make e-commerce marketing easier.

Not to mention it's going to help drive up your sales, which is one of the main goals that all businesses have. 
1. Cross-Sell Your Products
A customer has come close to the finish line, and they're almost ready to make a purchase; this is the time to try to persuade them to level up their product or purchase other products related to it. This tip will work well if your business has larger ticket items.
For example, Asos offers to buy the full look and offers items similar to the ones you just chose. 



When using this tip, ensure you've conducted a thorough review of your inventory to understand which products can be used in combination with others.
2. Improve the Customer Experience
The experience customers have with your company matters, and that's why it falls on our list of tips. Several things can be done to improve the customer experience: 

 	make sure your website is speedy
 	create a user-friendly UX
 	create a mobile-friendly UX (most of the customer shop this day via their smartphone, so you can also expand by creating an app)
 	make sure the purchasing instructions are clear, so users won't leave before buying thinking it's too complicated
 	implement chatbots to make sure there is support for those who are confused.
 	offer great customer service to customers before, during, and after the purchase of your products

3. Post Past Client Reviews
Potential customers want to know what other clients have to say about your products. Creating a space to post your past client testimonials can help to increase your conversion rate.

This will also boost your sales, which ensures continued business success. Make sure to remind your customers to leave their feedback or even reward them for doing so (e.g. 5% discount for the next order).
Another example from Asos shows also ""customer rating"" and helps you evaluate the quality and the size of the product using real people experience. 


4. Collaborate with Influencers
There are hundreds of influencers today with massive followings that trust the products they promote on their pages. If you don't have the following, but want to reach as many people as possible, you might look into working with an influencer.

Of course, influencers should also be amongst your target audience. You have to ask yourself: does your target audience follow this blogger? Do they trust this influencer?
One of the trends from 2021 is to actually ditch Instagram and YouTube influencers and invest in TikTok content. The costs are lower, but the coverage is way higher. Also, live videos seem to be more natural for eCom and create more trust towards advertised products. 
5. Use Videos
If you've got lots of information to share with people, you should start using videos. Videos give you a way to share information in a way that's engaging to your audience. Video tells more about your product or you as the brand owner than 1000 photographs.

There are several different ways to format a video, and you can post it on several channels. You can also request the influencers you work with to create videos to promote your brand.

They should show the product and, if possible, use it so people can see how it works.
The diamond in your eCommerce marketing strategy
No matter how much you invest in your marketing (whether it's time, money, or human resources), you need to measure the results of your campaigns. Paid Ads, organic traffic, influencers, affiliate marketers, referral links — there are too many traffic sources to keep it all under control. Using specialized marketing analytics software will save the day by taking the performance data from every channel you use for marketing.

At RedTrack, we offer more than just a tracking solution for eCommerce clients:

 	take all of the marketing channels to one dashboard for analysis
 	create an affiliate program or manage influencers
 	perform attribution (whether customer used promo code, followed a link or found you organically)
 	integrate everything in one click with our Native Shopify App (now in beta!)
 	and finally, make data-informed decisions for your growth

8745,The Affiliate Marketer's Ultimate Guide to Reaching Holiday Shoppers,"The leaves have all turned and fallen… Halloween has come and gone… somewhere, someone is playing Mariah Carey’s “All I Want for Christmas Is You”... It’s time to plan your holiday affiliate marketing strategy.

But where to begin? While 2021 may not have been as uniquely challenging as 2020, it has presented its own set of hurdles that have disrupted the marketing landscape. Supply chain woes, iOS14 updates, and shipping delays have shaken up marketing best practices and forced marketers everywhere to adapt. 

To help marketers ramp up for the holiday season and put to use everything they’ve learned this year, ClickBank has teamed up with RedTrack to create The Affiliate Marketer’s Ultimate Guide to Reaching Holiday Shoppers.

What’s in store for readers? In this guide we’re going to cover: 

 	How to Create the Best Holiday Ad
 	Where Are Advertisers Headed This Holiday Season?
 	Comprehensive Tracking: The Best Gift You Can Give Yourself

So, without further ado, we are delighted to share this gift of a post with you in hopes that it will help you reach all the shoppers with affiliate marketing holiday ads!
How to Create the Best Holiday Ad
There are three things affiliate marketers need to consider when creating holidays ads: cheer, coupons, and competition. With a combination of these elements, you can win at the holiday ad game and up your commission payout. Let’s unpack a little bit about each of these must-haves: 
Cheer 
What sets holiday ads apart from everyday ads? Even without in-depth inspection, the average internet shopper can identify a holiday ad right off the bat. It comes down to the cheer factor.

Holiday ads typically fall into a certain color scheme and have something that indicates agnostic festivities.



Since the internet marketing landscape is global, it’s important not to assume any particular holiday color scheme or style. This can be done with images of twinkles, ribbon, string lights, presents, champagne glasses, and smiling faces. 

These ads will catch attention because people generally equate holiday ads with increased savings.
Pro-Tip: If you don’t have the bandwidth to make good (like really good) holiday ads, don’t wing it. The holiday season is busy for everyone, so if you want your ad to stand out, hire a graphic designer to help design and execute the perfect holiday ads. 
Coupons
The holiday season typically involves gift-giving, so what better time than to offer a present to your customers in the form of a coupon? Coupons are scientifically proven to increase conversions and are especially effective during the holiday season. 
The best rule of thumb to follow when creating a coupon offer for customers is the “Three-Second Rule”. Customers should be able to fully grasp the bargain within three seconds of seeing it. The holiday season is complicated enough as it is--don’t go making things harder with OECBOGOHOUM (Only-Exclusive-Buy-One-Get-One-Half-Off-Only-Until-Midnight) coupons.
Not only should you keep coupons simple, you need to make sure there aren’t a million caveats about when and how the customer can use it. Does offering a coupon and guaranteeing free holiday shipping dig too far into your bottom line? The best practice here would suggest only offering one unless you can offer both. 
Competition
It’s true — the holiday season is about cheer, goodwill, kindness, and compassion. But it’s also fiercely competitive. While that may not make people feel merry and bright, it’s the reality for many digital marketers who earn their living online.

With that in mind, make sure that your ads and campaigns are competitive. (Heck, check it twice!) We encourage split testing, tracking, editing, fine-tuning, peer review, tracking... and did we mention tracking? 

You need to know what ads are working and which ones aren’t so you can optimize and scale with the best of the best. Analytics is a surefire way to keep your finger on the pulse of your campaign and stay competitive as you and every other digital marketer jockey for the attention of the holiday-shopping masses. 
Where are Advertisers Headed This Holiday Season?
While you design your holiday advertising campaign, be sure to keep in mind where you’ll be marketing. With the new iOS14 updates, many affiliate marketers have branched out to new channels in order to survive (and, in some cases, thrive). Let’s face it, Facebook was getting pretty crowded anyway. There’s plenty of advertising blue ocean out there… but which ones are the best for holiday advertising? 
Email Marketing 
If you plan to run an email marketing campaign for the holidays, make sure your emails are on point and complete with a catchy subject line. You’ll need to bring your email A-game. We encourage email marketers to create copy targeted to particular segments of their list.

The same advice for coupons applies to email marketing: keep it simple. The reader should be able to see the deal and understand it seconds after opening the email. Achieve this with visuals, compelling subject lines, and visible links that will help customers get where they need to go to make a purchase. 
Native 
While social ads tend to take center stage during the holiday season, we encourage digital marketers not to overlook the power of native advertising. Native advertising is oftentimes less expensive than social advertising, and with less competition, it can be highly lucrative if done right. 

What’s the magic recipe for a native holiday ad that spreads cheer and creates conversions? 

Two words: Target. Audience.

Identifying a target audience for each campaign will take some leg-work before you set off. It’s important to get ahead of the curve on this step, so start now if you’re going to. 
Good ol’ Social 
The number one rule when it comes to digital marketing on social media during the holidays is… stay competitive. How do you do that? Test and track. Test and track. Test and track. 

The data will tell you what’s working so make sure you are able to see what’s happening with your campaigns clearly and concisely.
Comprehensive Tracking: The Best Gift You Can Give Yourself 
One of the most critical parts of succeeding at holiday advertising is being able to identify successes and failures quickly so you can act just as quickly to optimize and shift as needed. The tool to do just that is comprehensive tracking — arguably the best gift you can give yourself this season.

A tracking solution that consolidates your media and attribution activity can save you time, focus, and make sure you’re spared from the pain of logging in to more platforms than you need.  

If you’re an affiliate marketer looking for a Facebook tracking solution with integrations galore, RedTrack can check those boxes.

If you have “efficiency” and “revenue” on your holiday list this year, sign up for RedTrack and change your holiday marketing process for the better.

8798,What is raw data in advertising? Everything you should know,"Even though marketing &amp; advertising is considered a creative industry, we all know that there is a lot of numbers, statistics, and calculations in this job.
In fact, I will take the responsibility to state that the anatomy of the creative advertising job lies in those numbers and data points that can only be revealed with raw data. 

In this article, we are going to review what is raw data for advertising, how it can change the way you do marketing, and why none of the platforms by Facebook or Google will NOT help you in the dissection of your advertising activities.
What is raw data? 
Raw data is a set of information that is delivered straight from the source and has not been altered or processed by algorithms or machine learning. 
If we talk about advertising specifically, raw data is a set of information that helps identify each target action made from advertising efforts. 

To put it simply, it is data as it is. Before it has been altered, interpreted, grouped, or put into any shapes for your further conclusions. 



If we talk about the RedTrack case, we collect raw data about all the clicks and conversions using first-party data and store it as it is, raw and unseasoned. 
Why do you need raw data for advertising? 
I’ll give you more graphs and schemes to understand this topic a bit later, but first I wanted to touch on the philosophical part of why raw data is so important for your advertising or marketing. 

In our daily operations tasks, we always base our decisions on sets of information or data. And depending on the quality of this data — change the outcomes of our decisions. 

Basically, the same happens with advertising. Whether you entrust automation &amp; optimization to make most of your advertising decisions or it’s your personal marketing call, depending on the data you receive about running ads, your decisions will change. 
Raw, unaltered, and unsampled data ensures that your decision is based on the most accurate information there is. 
But let’s see how it works and what are other scenarios of data usage in the advertising industry. 
How raw data works? 
As raw data is a set of information about the clicks and conversions without aggregation or sampling, we have to understand how it works. 

When a user clicks on the ad, this click is registered by your attribution &amp; analytics tool and once a conversion on a website is made, the click binds with the conversion. Behind every click and conversion, there is more data: click time, conversion time, device type, OS type, browser type, location, and most importantly, content type (aka which ad worked out). 



In RedTrack’s case, all this info is stored in the same raw way it was recorded, so you can play around with the data and look at your results from different angles. 
5 Advantages of raw data in advertising 

Let's review the list of benefits that your advertising receives if you choose to spice it up with raw data.
Attribution based on raw data 
The first and the most important advantage of using raw data is access to deterministic attribution.
Deterministic attribution is the process when each click is attributed to the conversion precisely according to the rules you set. 
On the contrary, sampled &amp; aggregated data can only give you probabilistic attribution where clicks are attributed to conversion with probability, rather than precision. We will dig into the details of data sampling a bit later, for now let’s focus on amazing deterministic attribution. 
Deterministic attribution: how can you use it for your advertising? 
When you use deterministic attribution paired up with raw data, you almost become a magician. 



That means that with the set of information you have you can use different rules and look at the data from different angles. 
Some of the rules you can use for deterministic attribution:

 	First-click attribution
 	Last-click attribution
 	Last paid click attribution
 	Attribution window 

Raw data and conversion insights 
Raw data gives you the precision on which click made it to the conversion. Let’s imagine that you are running ads on multiple advertising channels, on top of that doing influencer marketing and other activities, how do you know what exactly played out better to bring you the conversion? 

Depending on the attribution model of your advertising channel, the conversion will be attributed to a specific ad, even though it can be not necessarily true. 

For example, Facebook Ads manager is using the last-touch attribution model. That means that the last click before the conversion will be considered as the one that brought the conversion, while in fact there could be many other actions on a customer journey before that. 
Understanding the conversion gap 
Conversion gap is a period of time between the first interaction of the user with your advertising and the actual conversion time. 
What can happen during the conversion gap? So many things: users can see multiple ad banners, ads through influencers, they can google you and find your website through the organic source, and in the end, they can just purchase through a promo code they found online. 

With raw data, you get each activity of the user recorded and is available for analysis. While sampled &amp; aggregated data gives a very limited picture of what happened during the conversion gap if giving any at all. 
Better reporting on your ads 
Raw data gives an opportunity to build better, more detailed, and in-depth reports for advertising activities. 
Reports are your insights into what actually happens after you set your ad sets live. Those insights can be used further to make smarter decisions when distributing marketing budgets. 

Also reporting through different angles becomes handy if you need to prove the certain hypotheses and defend your results to the team or management. 
Better automation &amp; optimization of your ads 
The last point, but definitely not the least. There are two ways you can use raw data insights: think it over and change the strategy of your marketing or leave the changes to automation &amp; optimization. 

Some of the marketing analytics platforms allow you to set rules to control your performance according to the data received. 
For example, you may pause ads that receive less than X CR rate or direct the traffic to the ads that receive a bigger CTR. 
&nbsp;



&nbsp;

That’s the case with RedTrack, where you can amplify your marketing with the usage of raw data for automation through custom rules.

 If you want to learn how rules can change your marketing decision-making, be sure to talk to specialists from our team. 


Why not just use Facebook Attribution or Google Analytics? 
I oftentimes face the same question. Google Analytics / Google Tag Manager/ Facebook Ads Manager does a good job, why is it not enough? There are two main reasons why you can think of alternatives for data collection. 
Facebook and Google are self-attribution networks 
The simple answer is that both Facebook and Google are self-attribution networks. It means that each ecosystem is used for advertising and for attribution of the data. The more you spend money on advertising through them, the better it is for FB and Google. That makes them biased to show that conversions are coming from their advertising networks in order for you to invest more into their channels. 
Facebook and Google use data aggregation &amp; sampling 
On the other side of using raw data stand data aggregation, modeling, and sampling. 
&nbsp;

And that’s how Google Analytics and Facebook Ads Manager treat the data. 
If raw data is the info about each and every click and conversion. Aggregated &amp; sampled data is a model of that raw information, an average value. 

The graph below should give you more understanding of what is the main difference between raw and sampled data. 



Not only do those networks give you only an approximate picture of what’s going on with your advertising, but they also lack the flexibility and depth that raw data gives when it comes to attribution, reporting, and fighting the conversion gap. 
You simply lose a chance to manipulate data on the fly to analyze it from different angles and make decisions.
&nbsp;



&nbsp;
Raw data and ads: outcomes
It's surely not an easy topic for understanding, especially if you (just like me) enjoy the creative bits of our marketing journeys. However, it is a very important topic for marketing understanding.

Raw data can become a key to insights that change the way you do marketing, distribute budgets and make decisions with your team.

It becomes an even more significant task if you are working with multiple advertising &amp; marketing channels.

With RedTrack, access to raw advertising data is not a question anymore. What do we do?

 	Integrate with 25+ advertising channels
 	Collect raw advertising data through first-party data scripts
 	Provide you with reports &amp; insights about your marketing activities

As simple as that, your marketing team is amplified with various data sets for smarter decisions.

8824,How to advertise with TikTok Ads: Best Practices for 2023,"While many advertisers are getting more and more upset with Facebook Ads, the new channels for advertising grab our attention. A new gem of 2021 is TikTok Ads, and for sure it will get even more popular amongst advertisers in 2023.

But how to advertise with TikTok Ads? In this article, we partnered up with Youseff from TikTok advertising and going to share with you the best practices for TikTok ads in 2023, backed by empirical knowledge and extensive advertising experience.
Why TikTok Ads? 
TikTok, being the Top app in 136 countries in the world, becomes one of the trendiest social media networks in 2021. As of September 2021, TikTok has 35 million daily active users (DAU) only on iOS.


Source: Statista

This app is one of the greatest ways to reach out to the younger audience via the best-performing format — video.
While many brands turn to TikTok influencers for native advertising of their products or services, a new way to advertise emerged.

Using TikTok Ads manager is a new way to reach wider audiences and bring more awareness to your brand.
Even though, the logic of advertising is quite similar to Facebook Ads, the right strategy and understanding of the TikTok ins and outs are required to rock advertising on this channel. 
And we are going to reveal the best practices and creative advertising strategy with TikTok Ads in the following chapters.
How to advertise with TikTok
When running ads on TikTok, it’s crucial that you understand the rules of the platform. The TikTok advertising platform is very similar to the Facebook advertising platform in look and feel.

However, TikTok puts high emphasis on user experience and engagement. Obviously, it's good for us as advertisers, but we have to understand how to proceed in this ecosystem.

How people engage with your ads has a huge impact on the performance, so your advertising has to be creative and eye-catching.
💡Tip

TikTok's audience is always looking for new and interesting content, so don’t be afraid to experiment and try new things with your creatives. Your work should grab the attention of the users!
TikTok Ads Creatives Best Practices 
Rule 1: Use UGC content
UGC stands for user-generated content and it's the type of content that is created by people rather than brands.
If you are going to use FB Ads style creatives on TikTok, you are gonna lose big times. TikTok is curated by real content, made by people — UGC. So make sure to use the content for your creatives that will feel natural for the audience.



💡Tip
Empirical knowledge proves that ""FB style"" creatives have very poor performance on TikTok and may not even spend the budgets. 

Rule 2: include CTA in the TikTok Ads
Make sure that you include a CTA (call-to-action) inside your TikTok ads, as you have to navigate the user what he or she needs to do with your ad. 
What kind of CTAs you can try for your TikTok Ads?

 	Promo codes. They help increase buyers' intent. 
 	Discounts. It makes the purchase more appealing.
 	Free shipping offer.


Rule 3: Don't bother making professional ads for TikTok
Your ads don't have to be professionally made. What we recommend doing is trying several styles (in UGC format) until you find the best performing creative. After that, you can take inspiration from best-performing creatives and create similar styles.
💡Tip

In order to find the best creatives, consider using conversion tracking solutions. They will allow controlling CTR (click-through-rate), CR (conversion rate), and other statistics for your ad groups. As well give you opportunity to analyze the costs taken by ads.

Strategy for running TikTok Ads
Once you have all the creatives ready for your ad campaigns, it's time to launch your TikTok Ads. We recommend using the following strategy when launching your ads:

 	Launch each of your ad groups without any targeting. Let the platform do all the work and pick up your creatives.
 	Find the best-performing creatives. Once you can distinguish the best-performing creatives, you can proceed with the following steps.
 	Start adding specific interests that are related to the product that you are selling. After a while you will start finding perfect combos: winning creatives and interests that bring you the most conversion rate.
 	Time to scale. Use the winning combinations and increase the budgets on them.


Scaling your TikTok Ads
When scaling on TikTok ads try not to overcomplicate the process. There are two ways you can go with scaling your ads:

 	 Slowly increase the budget on all winning ad groups by 20% every 48 hours. We have found that ad groups continue to perform well even when the budget is raised.
 	Recreate your winning ad groups into a CBO (Campaign Budget Optimization) campaign and launch at a higher budget.

💡Tip

Please, keep in mind that creative fatigue happens really quickly on the platform so try not to make the budget really high because you will kill your creatives.
Key takeaways
Don't be afraid to step into undiscovered waters for your marketing in this new 2023 year. It's time to use new channels, increase your CRs and get higher returns. TikTok is just the right channel for that adventure.
Use this special strategy crafted by Youseff's team from TikTok advertising if you are just starting out or feel like you are not reaching the results you expect from advertising with TikTok.

RedTrack is capturing the first click (the first interaction of the user with your advertisement), the last click (last interaction before the conversion), and also all the assisted clicks (basically everything that happens in between).

&nbsp;
With the use of attribution you as a marketer gain ability to look at reports at different angles, play around with the statistics and choose what kind of interactions play the biggest role for your business.

2. Facebook Conversion API support 


Back in January, we faced the biggest hit of 2021 in terms of advertising. iOS 14 influenced Facebook and Facebook Conversion API changed conversion tracking &amp; attribution on FB.

If you are spending huge budgets on FB advertising, this is a must-have set of features.

Both of these features were heavily requested in our Facebook community where we help marketers make their way through FB Ads conversion tracking &amp; attribution.
5. Bing &amp; Google cost update improvements 
In May we improved our API integrations with two major advertising channels: Google and Bing.

RedTrack introduced cost updates for Bing and cost updates on different levels for Google (the same logic as for Facebook). 

With this update, RedTrack offers high efficiency for all major advertising channels, helping you receive &amp; deliver customized data sets to and from your favorite advertising channels.
6. Coupon-based tracking
With this feature going live we unlocked plenty of opportunities for those investing in influencer marketing.

By the way, you can find it under the Tools — Scripts.
10. Cross-browser attribution
A very important update for those who rely heavily on Facebook Ads as an advertising channel. RedTrack improved its attribution by introducing cross-browser attribution.

8941,How to use partnership marketing with RedTrack? Partnership Portal explained!,"Lately, there’s so much buzz around partnership marketing. While it’s hard to figure out which types of marketing are fitting the “partnership marketing” label, we can learn how to deal with 3 main directions: affiliate programs, referral marketing, and influencer marketing.

Let’s investigate together how Partnership Portal by RedTrack is able to support your marketing whether you choose to partner up with affiliates, referrals, or influencers. 
What is partnership marketing? 
Partnership Marketing is a way to collaborate with other businesses or simply partners in order to achieve the marketing (and therefore, financial) goals of all the partners. 
Partnership marketing can take many forms: from cross-promos of 2 businesses to affiliate links. But the core of the method is simple: to use the power of another person, business, or brand to promote your own. 
Different types of partnership marketing 
Today we are going to talk about 3 ways to collaborate through partnership marketing: affiliate program, referral program, and influencer marketing using RedTrack’s Partnership Portal. 
How to start an affiliate program with Partnership Portal by RedTrack
Affiliate program — is a special type of marketing when you introduce affiliate marketers as advertisers for your business.
We already made another article covering the intricacies and benefits of starting an affiliate program, so be sure to check it out. 



Partnership Portal has a super easy and intuitive UI that makes a creation of a new affiliate account seamless. 

With RedTrack Partnership Portal you get:

 	Easy sign-up for new affiliates
 	Customization of the sign-up, login pages (to gather the right information from your affiliates)
 	Customization of the e-mails you sent out to affiliates (to create a personalized experience for all the affiliates)


How to track affiliates' performance with Partnership Portal
Once your affiliates are signed up, they get access to the Portal with all the conditions of the affiliate program you run. You can set custom conditions for each campaign you run, or even customize it depending on the affiliate.

This is the list of rules and conditions you can set for your affiliate program:

 	type of payout (RevShare, CPA, etc.)
 	amount of payout (whether it's a percentage or fixed sum)
 	allowed OS for traffic
 	allowed devices for traffic
 	allowed locations for advertisement
 	you can also add creatives that affiliates can use for campaigns

Once you fully describe the future campaign (on the admin side), your affiliate will see the campaign description in the Portal, as well instantly receive different types of tracking links to control the performance.

&nbsp;



&nbsp;

Affiliates can use direct and redirect tracking links, also allowing them to track impressions (if the channel supports it). Affiliates also can see their performance in the main dashboard and control how many clicks and conversions they are bringing to your business.



&nbsp;

As an affiliate program owner, you can control the performance of the affiliates through a separate affiliate report, as well as look at it in the main Dashboard (that combines all of your advertising channels).
Just like that, you are able to compare the results from affiliates' campaigns with the rest of marketing channels you are using.

Test Partnership Portal during a 14-day free trial (no CC required).
Manage referral marketing with Partnership Portal 
If you don't want to bother yourself with creating an affiliate program, you can always go with referral marketing. It can be simpler in the process setup, but still very fruitful.

You can easily share referral links and enjoy the results of people spreading the word about you, while rewarding them with a small commission.
How to use Multilevel marketing (MLM) with RedTrack
Another way to advance your referral marketing is using Multilevel marketing.
Multilevel marketing (MLM) is a practice of promotion where you reward each level of referral marketers accordingly. That means that all marketers can recruit other members of the network that can work on your promotion.
In order to use MLM in digital marketing, you need special software like RedTrack that allows to reward each level of recruited referral marketers according to their performance automatically.

In the Partnership Portal, you can set the amount of the commission, how ""deep"" the referral program can go (aka how many levels it can have), and finally what's the decrement for each level (meaning how much less each level of referrals will get). Once you set your requirements, the rest of the process will be performed automatically by RedTrack.



To understand better how MLM works, take a look at the example below. This picture showcases how MLM works on 3 levels, rewarding each referral participating in the recruitment of other partners.



If you need more details about how referral marketing with RedTrack works, feel free to book a demo and get a consultation from our specialists.
Collaborate with influencers 
And finally, probably the trendiest advertising tactic of 2021-2022 is influencer marketing.

Partnership Portal also gives you a chance to successfully collaborate with influencers.
The unique advantage of Partnership Portal by RedTrack is ability to use both: tracking links and promo codes for influencer campaigns.


The ability to use both tracking methods gives full control over the influencer's performance and allows you to make decisions, based on the real data about the numbers behind each influencer campaign.

Access to tracking links and special unique promo codes is also given through a Partnership Portal. You can either create an account for your influencer or just send them over all the necessary links and coupons.


Partnership Portal Takeaways
Partnership Portal is a unique platform developed by RedTrack in order to support your adventures in partnership marketing.

RedTrack combines advanced features coming from ad tracking &amp; attribution field with collaboration tools that help manage relationships with all of your partners:

 	issuing needed links or promo codes
 	tracking the performance of each partner
 	comparing the performance of all of your advertising channels
 	simplify relationships with your partners by automating the process (bye-bye performance spreadsheets👋)

9009,Facebook Conversion Attribution 2023 Explained,"How does Facebook Attribution work? How does Facebook count conversions? How does Facebook attribute conversions?

If you find yourself constantly rolling those questions in your head, it’s time to learn about Facebook Ads conversion tracking &amp; attribution. In this article you may find: 

 	How Facebook Ads does conversion tracking after iOS14 update 
 	How Facebook attribution works 
 	Common myths and truths about Facebook 

Without further ado, let’s jump into all things Facebook Ads attribution to get this favorite advertising channel of ours under control. 
Facebook conversion tracking before iOS 14 update 
Before the iOS 14 update, we all used Facebook pixel. 

FB pixel was responsible for capturing the performance data (clicks, conversions, also a lot of personal information about the users used for targeting later). 
Facebook pixel was tracking the full conversion path of everything that’s going on with your advertising. The tracked data was going to Facebook Machine Learning to optimize your campaigns and reach even better results. 

How Facebook conversion tracking works after iOS 14 
After the ATT prompt by Apple, Facebook lost the ability to track the users on iOS 14 and later versions.

Instead of a full conversion path, Facebook is able to track only the last event (see the scheme below). 



So instead of view content, initiate check out, add-to-cart, Facebook will track only the “purchase” event. 
Because of the influence of the update, Facebook is suffering a significant data loss from Apple devices. 
How does Facebook attribution work in 2022? 
Facebook takes data from both: iOS 14 and non-iOS 14 devices and uses data modeling.
Data modeling by Facebook is the process of building a model from all the data sets it has. 
The model also means that it’s an estimated count of your conversions, an estimated attribution. Just an average picture behind your conversions and sales. 

There would be nothing wrong with modeling if all the data used for the process was accurate. However, in the case of Facebook, it’s a mix of 2 different types of data sets: from iOS14 devices and all the other devices. Therefore, if you have a big chunk of iOS users in your funnel, the model can show a lot of discrepancies.

Data modeling by Facebook is based on probability, rather than accuracy.


What's Facebook Attribution model? 
It brings us to another important point of this article: the Facebook attribution model. 
Facebook is using probabilistic attribution, even though many believe the platform uses deterministic attribution models. 


When all the data is modeled, Facebook is attributing your conversions to certain campaigns, ad sets, or ads with the probability that it happened in a specific way. Because after the update described above, Facebook has no ability to make it according to the deterministic attribution model. 

Later when Facebook modeled the data, performed an attribution, you can see all the numbers in Facebook Ads Manager. This same data is used for machine learning and optimization of your ads. And that’s exactly why optimization &amp; targeting in 2022 is not working as great as it used to. 



&nbsp;
Facebook attribution myths and truths of 2022
Now let’s explore a couple of myths and truths connected to Facebook conversion tracking and attribution in 2022. 
1) Goal optimization is not working anymore 
It’s a myth. Facebook machine learning is still trying to feed the algorithms as much data as possible to make goal optimization thrive, but this data is not sufficient which causes disruption. So the truth is: it works, but not as great as before. 
2) Facebook uses a deterministic attribution model
If you read this article carefully, you already know it’s a big no-no. Facebook is using probabilistic attribution models and is working with your conversions based on probability.
3) Facebook Ads Manager is a source of truth 
Well, it’s a myth, because Facebook is a self-attribution network that uses data modeling. It means that Facebook is not displaying an accurate picture and will always try to attribute as many conversions as possible back to Facebook. 

We have a detailed article on the difference between raw data in advertising and modeled data, so check it out if you wanna learn more on the subject. 


Facebook VS RedTrack conversion attribution
Unlike Facebook, RedTrack uses deterministic attribution, which means we do not attribute conversions with probability. Rather give you a chance to decide how you want your conversions to be assigned.  With deterministic attribution, you can choose between:

 	First click
 	Last click 
 	Assisted clicks for your attribution settings

You can also set a particular attribution window (e.g. 30 days) to control how your conversions will be assigned. 

To perform accurate conversion tracking for Facebook, RedTrack developed Smart Attribution. Smart attribution ensures the accuracy of your conversion tracking &amp; attribution because of the following qualities: 

 	Cross-browser attribution 
 	Raw data 
 	First-party data

🎁 bonus


1. The rise of video continues 
I think it’s even cliche to say it out loud but yes, the video does continue to be the biggest trend. 

Video is the best form of content out there in 2022, no matter what type you prefer to nail. You can go in several directions. 


Short videos
Many platforms now support short-format videos. It can be TikTok, Instagram reels, YouTube shorts, or even short clips for your Facebook and LinkedIn account strategies. Before you decide to invest in the short format, be sure to choose the platform wisely and adapt the content to the type of audience that hangs out around this platform.

Long-form video content
Even though there's a lot of fuss around short videos and marketers keep talking about a users' short attention span, long videos are not disappearing from our screens. Every type of content has the right platform for it. So if your target audience can be found watching videos on YouTube (or other platforms), be sure to use it. 
Live events and streams
Video helps us all connect and learn what and who stands behind the product or service. Live events and streams become especially important if we are talking about B2B marketing. Live events help see the team who creates the product, but most importantly it helps create this special connection during the digital era and improve the brand image. 
With help of live streams, you can raise brand awareness, build trust with your audience and connect.
2. Visual search (SEO)
Well, we all love organic traffic. Also, I believe that at some point content marketers went a little crazy with all things SEO. We all know these keyword-abused pieces of content where you really miss just the language you want to understand as a human, not a Google algorithm.

While you are choosing your side with SEO-based or human-based articles, I recommend paying attention to optimizing your product for visual search. 
Visual search optimization or visual SEO is a process of optimization of your content to be searched through any pieces of visual content (pictures, diagrams, videos, etc.).
Here I recommend focusing on 2 niches.


Win Google visual SEO
It's super hard to get on the first page of Google search queries with your content, even if it's great. Our experience shows that landing the first page under the picture or video tab is at least twice easier. Make sure to add alt text under pictures so it could be indexed in the search. And don't forget to create a video that could give the answer to the query and possibly make it to a snippet for you.
Here's an example of a snippet from the video we produced for our Youtube channel which ended up on the first Google page.
 

Explore Pinterest and YouTube 
Pinterest is here to back you up with a picture search. YouTube — with video search.
When it comes to Pinterest, users come to the platform to explore trends, inspiration, find certain products or lifehacks. If your product suites any of those purposes, you might wanna invest more in your Pinterest account and end up as a pin on someone's board (aka a purchased product in the cart).
YouTube literally becomes the second Google as so many people look for answers in this media. Make sure to first follow trend #1 (using video content), create a certain strategy of your video presence, and then do your research with keywords you want to target through YouTube.

And yes, one of biggest YouTube's advantages is that there's far less competition. Not all companies have either guts or resources to explore this platform, so be amongst the first.

With that being said, if you prefer to learn the subject through video or audio, I recommend watching this video instead of reading this article. We optimize our content for your needs 😏


3. All things TikTok
It’s both exciting and slightly annoying to listen about TikTok all the time as a marketer. But here it is, one of the major social media and advertising platforms of 2022. 

In May 2021, TikTok bit YouTube in average time spent in the app, which comes to 24 hours a week.

And we, as marketers, have to go where user engagement goes. I want to believe it's an actual saying 😅

Earlier, brands were saying that TikTok doesn’t have the right audience for them. Well, TikTok has around a billion monthly active users, and if you are not trying to reach this audience, somebody else does. Find a way to utilize TikTok whether you are B2B or B2C.



With TikTok you have several options:

 	Create a TikTok account and find a passionate person to take care of the content
 	Advertise through TikTok Ads. Here you might wanna use our guide on best practices when using TikTok ads.
 	Create influencer campaigns on TikTok. Here don't forget to take care of the tracking software that will be able to issue links and promo codes for influencers and then track bloggers' performance.

4. Cookieless advertising
It's more of an anti-trend, but still. I have to mention it. Not everyone still understands the danger of cookieless future. In 2021 we got hit with ATT prompt. Will this year be any easier? Do we know what to expect?
That's the most important part of this anti-trend, we don't really know what's coming. Though we definitely have to be prepared.
Let's explore possible scenarios of 2022: 

 	Andriod can implement the same update as iOS did, since privacy issues are same for everyone, just different platforms take different time to implement changes. 
 	Other advertising channels can come up with similar restrictions as Facebook did after iOS 14 update. For example, same can happen to TikTok and then we will lose access to a well-performing TikTok advertising. 
 	Even though Google moved the effect of Google Privacy Sandbox to 2023, we can still experience the vibrations of the changes in the Google ecosystem. Most likely, the channel will be testing new protocols preparing us for cookieless future. 

What can you do to prepare for cookieless future?
Stop using pixels or any other examples of client-side tracking to measure the performance of your advertising. It's time to find the right solution for server-side tracking (S2S) that will be compliant with all privacy updates and ensure accurate conversion tracking at the times of privacy concerns.

Some of the benefits of server-side tracking:

 	accurate conversion tracking, not interrupted by pixel misfires or ad blockers
 	conversion tracking for iOS 14 (and older) devices
 	compliant with all privacy updates &amp; future-proof

RedTrack has been leading the market of cookieless tracking solutions. Implement server-side tracking with all of your marketing channels and play by the rules of the Privacy updates.


5. Use partnership marketing 
Partnership marketing is one of the key trends of the past marketing years. The reason is pretty simple: it gets really lonely and complicated to market products on your own. Much easier to use the power and influence of other partners. Whether it's affiliate marketers, referrals, or fellow brands &amp; companies. 
All sorts of creative collaborations will be of use in 2022 to stand out, the more marketers or brands will be able to spread the word about you — the better. 
When choosing to go with influencer campaigns, affiliate marketing, or other partner marketing thingies, don’t forget about the process of tracking the results of those. Since all of the numbers are on another side (side of your partner), it’s good if you settle tracking links or special promo codes to control the whole performance. 

At RedTrack, we developed a Partnership Portal to help manage relationships with your partners. You can issue links, promo codes and get the reports on the performance of all partners in one place. Be sure to give it a try as part of 14-day free trial (no CC required).
All-time digital marketing trend
Besides, I'm gonna share with you one final tip. A piece of advice that never gets old, but always brings marketers to better places.
Personalize, make it authentic, and quite boringly, don't lie.
In a very competitive field where digital marketing specialists are fighting for the users' attention, it's super important to stay human, speak the same language as your audience does and be authentic with them.
I wish you the best of luck and fortune this year to make it as far as you couldn't even imagine!

Best eCommerce platforms 
Probably one of the most important things you want to figure out when starting or improving eCom business is gonna be choosing eCommerce platforms and plugins.
Before proceeding, check out our newest eCommerce series on YouTube — Figure{It}Out!


What is eCommerce platform?

eCommerce platform allows connecting the end consumer and the seller. It’s a special application or software that makes it possible for both: you to sell goods and customers to find them and purchase. 
When choosing your eCommerce platform, you predefine how smooth the seller-customer relationship will be going. So be sure to take a look at these features and qualities: 

 	How easy it is to integrate
 	User interface (for you as the website owner and for the customers)
 	Design options &amp; how customizable the platform is 
 	Integration with advertising &amp; marketing channels 
 	Payment integrations 
 	Support team 
 	Security and reliability 

1. Shopify
Probably one of the most well-known eCommerce platforms for SMBs is Shopify. No wonder why, it’s super easy to use and understand, integrate with other platforms. You can find various themes and templates to customize your eCom store, add payment processing, add tracking of the orders &amp; more. On top of that, it’s a super-secure and reliable platform. 

Still, there are some downsides to Shopify, such as it can get expensive over time and if you're budget-conscious, consider Shopify alternatives for creating and managing your online store.
2. WooCommerce
It’s not a platform, but a very handy tool that will enable you to create a fascinating store. WooCommerce is a completely free plugin for your WordPress website. If you ever created a website on WordPress before, you know how easy and native the process is.
With a simple plugin from WooCommerce, you can activate your eCommerce business on this website. Users love it because it’s so simple to integrate, customizable, and also secure. 
3. BigCommerce
BigCommerce is a SaaS (software as a service) solution that allows starting your eCom store. It has 12 free templates, it’s easily customizable, and has integrations with major payment gateways. You can also tweak the code (HTML and CSS), so it makes it a competitive advantage. 
BigCommerce also has a 0% transaction fee for all payments on the platform, which is great. 
4. Adobe Commerce (prev. Magento)
Adobe Commerce (previously Magento) — yet another popular eCommerce platform to build your own store. It’s free to download, but also has a paid version focused on the enterprise. However, this platform might require some code tweaking to get the result you need, so be prepared to hire a developer. If you prefer an easy UI, we recommend sticking to the eCommerce platforms described above. 
5. Squarespace
Squarespace is a website builder with eCommerce functionality. This platform allows to build sophisticated landing pages, so if you care about design — it’s a must recommend. It also has great inventory management features. However, Squarespace lacks a few integrations if you compare it to Shopify, WooCommerce, or BigCommerce. 


6. Ecwid 
Ecwid is probably the best tool to start your small store since it’s very simple to use and it allows you to create an eCom store from any website or even social media page. 

It’s a simple widget that you can integrate with pretty much anything you already use.

This solution might be more affordable than others since it’s a plug-n-play format for existing websites. However, there are more expansive plans that will allow advanced features. 
eCommerce Marketing Solutions 
Before you are gonna start an eCommerce store, it’s better to have a plan on how you are gonna market it. The competition is real so you need to plan a very distinctive marketing strategy that will be promoting your business and helping sales. To help with all the planning, check out our eCom marketing strategy guide. And best eCommerce marketing tools you can find below.

9135,How to track TikTok Ads: TikTok Pixel VS Custom Tracking Solution,"Since TikTok Ads is running the show in 2022, we as marketers have to find the best way to track this channel. Measuring results of your TikTok advertising campaigns is crucial to control the performance and perform better targeting &amp; optimization.

There are 2 major options when it comes to tracking TikTok Ads: TikTok Pixel or getting a custom tracking solution. In this article, we are going to explore how to track TikTok Ads with both of those methods. What are the benefits and disadvantages of each of them?
Let's get in this article to find out!
How to track TikTok Ads performance
Just like with any paid ads channel, you will have to go through a hassle of a technical setup when figuring out ad tracking. If you start out with small budget, you probably will be good with the TikTok platform for monitoring the performance. But once you are starting to raise your ad costs, the lack of proper tracking of your TikTok advertising campaigns can result in huge losses. 

In order to prevent this, you have to make your choice: TikTok Pixel or a custom tracking solution.


TikTok Pixel to track TikTok Ads
TikTok Pixel is basically same thing as Facebook pixel. It's a piece of code that performs tracking for you and is considered to be client-side tracking (which means usage of third-party cookies). 
The main benefit of using a TikTok pixel for tracking is that it’s relatively easy to set up. You are able to place the code on your website's ""thank you"" page and it will do the tracking job for you. Check out official tutorial from TikTok. 
Advantages of TikTok Pixel:

 	Conversion tracking: you will be able to track conversions (or sales) coming from TikTok Ads. 
 	Optimization. TikTok pixel allows you to improve optimization by feeding the algorithms more data about the users who are more likely to purchase. The more sales your pixel captured — the better goal optimization you may expect. 
 	Ability to integrate with partners (like Shopify or WooCommerce).
 	Access to custom audiences. When you connect TikTok pixels you get a chance for remarketing activities, creating custom audiences from the data sets that TikTok pixel gathers. For example, you can check where the user drops off the funnel and remarket to this audience later on with a specific ad. 
 	Easy setup. If you worked with Facebook Ads before, you won’t find any problem setting up TikTok pixel, the process is very similar. 

However, as mentioned above, TikTok pixel is using third-party cookies and is an example of coookie-based tracking (or client-side tracking).

 We already created a detailed explanation on what's the difference between pixels and server-side tracking solutions, so be sure to check it out. But let's go over a few disadvantages of using TikTok pixel for tracking. 
TikTok pixel misfires

 	TikTok pixel can easily get blocked due to the activity of the ad blockers
 	TikTok pixel is using third-party cookies and we all know that cookieless advertising future is being forced by Apple, Google, Mozilla, and other major players of the market. Tracking with use of third-party cookies is reaching it's last breath.

Tracking solution for TikTok Ads
An alternative for TikTok tracking would be using a custom solution from ad tracking software. It can be more complicated when it comes to the setup at the beginning. However, it's more trustworthy and reliable. Especially if your tracker is using only first-party data and server-side tracking (S2S), as we discussed above. 

As S2S tracking works without third-party cookies and is not affected by ad blockers, conversion data will have more accuracy, especially if you have a lot of post-iOS 14 device traffic (those devices have more privacy-related restrictions). It’s a secure, privacy-compliant tracking method, which is crucial when we are talking about the cookieless era of advertising. 
Benefits of a third-party tracking solution for TikTok Ads


 	Ad tracker will measure TikTok Ads with more accuracy
 	It can't get blocked by ad blockers or other events
 	Cookieless friendly solution (if you tracker support first-party data)
 	Feeds more data to the algorithms (improves optimization and targeting)
 	You can get granular reports on your campaigns (learn more datapoints about the performance of your ads, like time, location, device type, etc.)
 	Ability to control the costs of your advertising campaigns: the tracker will get the data about ad costs to the report

How to use tracker for TikTok Ads
When choosing to track TikTok ads with specialized software, the setup process will vary depending on the solution you are using. 

RedTrack is one of the pioneers in TikTok tracking and supports API integration with TikTok and makes tracking process seamless.

Despite the fact that custom tracking solution are more complicated to set up, we have a pretty easy workflow.
1. Create TikTok pixel
Yes, everything still starts with a TikTok Pixel. You can use the same guide for TikTok Pixel setup in order to create one. TikTok pixel will be serving as a designated place to store data from TikTok.
2. Connect your tracker with TikTok
With RedTrack, it's gonna be as easy as filling in a few fields and pressing ""connect"" button. You will also need to confirm a few permissions and fill in pixel tokens.


3. Create mapping for TikTok
In order to send conversion data (data about sales, add-to-carts, abandoned carts, etc.) back to TikTok you will need to create mapping. When using RedTrack, you have universal conversion types (see left column on the picture below) for all of your marketing channels (e.g. Facebook, Google, Bing, etc.).

In this part you will have to match RedTrack conversion types with the data you want to send to TikTok for optimization.


4. Install universal tracking script
The universal tracking script is a unique feature that lets you track events on your website from various channels (e.g. TikTok Ads, Facebook Ads, Google Ads, Organic traffic, etc.).
Once you set up a universal tracking script for your website, you will be able to send data about all the conversions to RedTrack. And then RedTrack will be sending the data you determine to advertising channels (like TikTok, for example).


5. Get a custom tracking domain
Custom tracking domain is a special type of domain used for tracking.

Custom domains are more secure for users, advertising networks and help you avoid being blocked by ad blockers, etc.
When you use a custom tracking domain, you are making sure your conversion data is accurate and no blocking is gonna happen. It can be slightly confusing in terms of the setup. But good news is that you only have to do it once and this domain will be used for tracking of all your advertising channels/

For more info on custom tracking domains follow this guide.
6. Launch a campaign on TikTok
Once all the techy tracking job is done, you are ready to get the TikTok ads running and measured!


Why using ad tracker for TikTok ads?
Besides the accuracy provided by ad trackers for measurement of TikTok ads and getting control over the efficiency of the campaigns, there are a couple other benefits.
For example, you are able to unite all of your marketing activities in one dashboard. In case of RedTrack, you are able to go deep with reports on each ad channel, each campaign or ad set. You will see the data you wanna see (from clicks to the revenue generated from each particular ad).

That makes it easy to make well-informed decisions about the advertising campaigns and prevents you from losing ad budget on non-performing campaigns or even channels.

While some marketers focus more on advertising, stats say that 86% of people ignore the paid ads and scroll right to the organic search results. 

From there, every step of the ladder matters. Over 25% of people click on the first result. The same source says that if you’re the first, CTR is x10 higher than if you’re the 10th on the list.

When talking about optimization for conversion, it’s more about grabbing the reader's attention and engaging them enough for them to go to the next level (buying from you, signing up for a newsletter, etc.)

For the best result, you should optimize for multiple goals, including search engine visibility, engagement, conversion, etc.

So, why is content important here? 56% of marketers who use blogging as a promotion channel say it’s effective, with 10% of them saying it’s responsible for the bigger ROI (return on investment).
How High-Converting Content Works
So, how to convert with content? How does it work?
Your content can build a funnel for visitors to follow, which will lead them to product pages and prompt them to buy from you. This will only happen if you use links wisely throughout your content, write persuasively, use the right CTAs, etc.
For most websites, the main goal is to generate leads and convert them into buyers. You educate readers and provide them with useful information about your niche, products, and services. All of those actions should eventually lead to the purchase, subscription, or any other target action for your business. 

You should use digital marketing strategies to catch your target audience’s attention and optimize content with:

 	Wise keyword use
 	Catchy titles
 	Unique writing style
 	Improved user experience, etc.

Convert with Content: How to Optimize to Achieve Results
So, what should you do to achieve high conversions with your content? We have several professional recommendations that will help you understand the specifics of the process.



&nbsp;
1. Find your target audience
The first and the most important step in creating amazing and high-converting content is find your niche and learning who your target audience (TA) is. You need to define your audience, understand where you can find them, understand their pains and motives.
The more information you can find about the behaviour of your TA — the better. Before you know who you are writing for, you can not optimize your content. You need to understand the pain that drives your TA to search for your content. 
How can you possibly find all of this data on your target audience?

 	Find platforms, communities, and other spaces where your target audience is located and watch their conversations, hardships, etc. A great idea would be to find Facebook groups or subreddits. This way you will see your TA in their ""natural habitat"".
 	Host interviews with your TA. The easiest way to understand someone is to talk to them. Ask one of your clients or leads to answer a few questions for you and give them a small reward or bonus for time spent.
 	Check what your competitors are doing, especially those who are more successful than you are. Most likely those people already explored your TA and you can use their tactics. But don't forget that bigger companies are usually less willing to talk to real people. So if you've done the first two steps, you might improve your strategy by combining experience from customers and the strategy of your competitors.
 	Check feedback on existing content and across all of your platforms (e.g. support team, sales team). Maybe your TA has already pointed out a few things that you can fix, but the marketing department has been blind to the issue!

All in all, I believe, that many companies are desperately trying to ""squeeze more juice"" from their content, but it just doesn't work.
Content doesn't convert unless it solves the problem. To solve the problem you gotta know the problem. And gotta know who exactly has this problem 😏
2. Perform keyword research
Once the TA is found and the main pains and problems explored, time to find instruments that can help reach out to our audience. And those instruments are keywords. Let's look at it as those keywords are connecting our content to the right audience. And even if you have great content, but you are using wrong words (or keywords)— you will not reach the audience.
Keyword research will help you investigate the exact wording for your TA.
For example, to create a single blog post, you need: 

 	A couple of general relevant search terms to broadly outline the topic
 	Long-tail KWs for blog post titles and headings
 	Questions related to the focus phrases to use as subtopics within the article

The latter will help you estimate how relevant the initial keyword you choose for the article is. 
What you should look for when choosing keywords:

 	Have enough traffic potential (search volume) without being too competitive (difficulty) 
 	Be relevant and interesting for your TA so that people don’t leave your website, find important answers, and possibly convert.

To find such keywords for your website, you can use a digital tool like SE Ranking. This keyword suggestion tool will provide you with keyword ideas, give you a list of broad and long-tail terms, show you the search volume and difficulty of each key phrase, as well as inform you who is showing up on the SERPs for those keywords.

And our last keyword-related recommendation is to use long-tails. 
The conductor states that long-tail keywords have an x2.5 higher conversion rate. If someone finds your website using such a KW, it means they have a clear intention to take the focus action because they’re interested in the topic.
3. Write in a catchy style and work on your copy
People spend 37 seconds on average reading a blog post. The same source states that 43% of people simply skim through content instead of reading it attentively from the very beginning.

What does this mean?

You have less than a minute to catch the attention of the reader. The most effort should be put into the beginning of the article. That’s why, the whole piece should be engaging and interesting (anything but boring) and:

 	The headline has to spike interest and curiosity, but not with clickbait. The latter catches attention but is usually followed with disappointment and a bad experience for the reader. Only use such an approach if you actually have groundbreaking news.
 	The intro should be brief and intriguing. Share some statistics, leave a cliffhanger, explain what value your article provides. If applicable, some humor won’t hurt. It may be the first time a potential customer visits your website. Make sure they have a good time.
 	Use engaging visuals. A video, graphic, or screenshot will help. Studies confirmed that 65% of the population are visual learners, which means we perceive visual information better. Using visuals also saves time since you see the key information right there on the infographic, for instance, and don’t have to read the full text.

Other tips are to add real cases and improve the readability of your content. The text is still very important, so don’t skimp on its quality even if you’re using great visuals.

For the highest conversion, put all the important info and an encouraging CTA in the first half of the content.

Also, let’s not forget that a slight nudge to users that you’re here with great content is never redundant. Try to send push notifications to readers with a catchy thesis that will cause curiosity and make them visit your new post and appreciate the effort (and maybe convert into a buyer).
4. Show your expertise and credibility
58% of consumers will only trust a brand after they see proof. 

53% of consumers say that trusting the company is even more important than price to them when it comes to making a buying decision.

There are more stats like this, and they all mean one thing – you need to build trust, authority and prove your expertise. There are several ways to do this:

 	Share real cases.
Ask your key customers to share their experiences working with your business. Winning cases are the best, but it’s also important to share those that may not have started out perfectly. Show that your company has a personality and strives to become better in every way possible.
 	Share educational content.
Don’t forget to educate your readers on using your products or services. Moreover, you can create informative content on various topics related to your business niche. Then, you can link to key products and services there, and test different CTAs, improving conversion on those pages dramatically. Additionally, it will show your expertise within your field.
 	Involve influencers.
Collaborate with influencers to build social proof and authority. Make sure you choose people to work with carefully, making sure they’ll be interested in promoting your website, products, and services.

Later on, you’ll be able to use the mentions of your cooperation on your website to nudge visitors to become leads and leads to become customers. 49% of consumers depend on influencer recommendations. So, having a loyal influencer as a partner isn’t a bad idea.
5. Work on the UX (user experience) of your website


Understanding how people are using your website is crucial. What content they see first, how they navigate, how they like your site, everything is important. The content you share has to be:

 	Credible
 	Findable
 	Desirable
 	Accessible
 	Usable
 	Useful
 	Valuable

But the site itself has to offer a nice user experience. This includes:

 	Navigation.
Visitors should have access to a convenient navigation bar on the first viewing screen. It has to compile all the most important sections. Every page should be accessible within 3 to 4 clicks from the homepage.
 	Loading speed.
A 5-second loading results in a 90% bounce rate. Over 50% of mobile users will leave a site if it loads for more than 3 seconds, according to the same source. So, when people come for your content, don’t make them wait.
 	Persuasive CTAs (calls to action).
This aspect is crucial for your conversion rate. Sometimes all a person needs to buy from you is a soft nudge. The case of Brafton shows that adding CTA buttons to article templates may increase revenue by 83% in one month!
Maybe not every result is that dramatic, but the tendency is clear.

6. Track the Performance of Your Content and Make the Right Adjustments
Last but not least, to be able to improve the conversion rate by optimizing content, you have to know the current state of affairs. Do research to know your:

 	Pages with the highest conversion rate 
 	Pages with the lowest conversion rate 
 	User path (what pages they visit before finding themselves on the conversion page).
 	Find out the performance of your CTAs within the content.

The right software will help you do all of that and control the performance of all marketing channels in one place. RedTrack is a universal marketing tool that helps issue tracking links, promo codes for influencers and track every channel you use for marketing or advertising.


Final words
High-conversion content is much more than writing shouting CTAs all over your content. It’s a complex process that involves the talent of your writer, wise usage of keywords that match the search intent of your target audience, the user experience of your website, and much more.

For the best results, use a combination of the above-mentioned recommendations.",2/22/2022,https://redtrack.io/blog/a-guide-to-creating-high-converting-content/,digital marketing|Uncategorized
9191,What is Marketing Attribution? Attribution models explained!,"On average, from the experience of our clients, you have anywhere from 3 to 5 different touchpoints with the customers before the magical conversion happens. 
And here’s the question: which touchpoint is more important in the joined forces towards the conversion result? 
Here comes marketing attribution to demystify the reality behind your conversion and the performance of each campaign and help connect all the dots behind the real value of each channel, campaign, and ad. 
Some marketers consider marketing attribution too complicated of a subject, so let’s try to make it as simple as possible and reveal the nature of marketing attribution and marketing attribution models, as well as learn how to apply it in your marketing activities. 


What is marketing attribution? 
Marketing attribution is a process of identifying the touchpoints (aka channels or campaigns) which contribute to the revenue results while assigning different values to the touchpoints in the funnel. 
Attribution helps understand the behavior of the consumer and evaluate the importance of each marketing channel for your business. 

In order to to do that, we need to use marketing attribution models. Let's see what is it.
Marketing attribution models are
Attribution models are sort of frameworks to analyze customer behavior. 
Depending on the model you choose — you will see a different picture. And that’s the beauty of marketing attribution models. 
Examples of marketing attribution models: 

 	First-click — assigning 100% of the value to the very first interaction with your funnel.
 	Last-click — assigning 100% of the value to the very last interaction with your funnel
 	Assisted clicks — assigning value to all the intermediate clicks 
 	Linear — assigning an equal value between all touchpoints. 
 	Time-decay — assinging bigger value to the channel with time. 
 	U-shaped — assigning more value to the first and the last touchpoint, and minimal value to the assisted touchpoints. 


Marketing attribution modeling in action
To understand better the attribution models in action, let’s take an imaginary conversion path. 



We can see that first touchpoint in this case was the influencer campaign. That was the first click in the funnel. And the last event before the conversion happened was just an organic search.

If we take a first-click attribution model, we would give all the credits for the conversion to that one influencer.

If we take last-click attribution, we would give the credit to organic traffic. If we act smarter and choose last paid click attribution model — Google Search ad would be the hero. 

If we take assisted click model, then Facebook campaigns would be of importance to make sure user converts.
Marketing attribution modeling allows us to look at the conversion funnel from different angle and understand that there is no single answer when it comes to the question ""why conversion happened"".
What can you learn from attribution reports? 
There is a limitless number of things you can learn from attribution reports, it all depends on your creativity and what you want to learn. Let's take a look at a couple of examples:

 	You can learn which channel usually brings attention to your company. That would be a first-click attribution model. When you use attribution and find the channel or campaign that usually becomes the first in the funnel, you may make a natural conclusion on which channel serves best for the first touchpoint with the audience.
 	Learn which channel serves better for conversion purposes. That would be last-touch attribution model. Find out the pattern of which channel usually becomes the last touch-point before conversion happens.
 	Learn how long it takes for the user to convert. Measure the length of the conversion path for the user and find out which touchpoints are key to make conversion happen.
 	Understand the importance of individual advertising campaigns in the funnel. See the performance by campaigns and ads in the funnel and find their value towards the conversion goal.

The data you receive depends on the marketing attribution model you choose. But here's the important question: which model is better?
How to choose a marketing attribution model?
That's a very interesting question. And there is no single answer to that. Since attribution model is just a framework for the analysis of your performance, it's your call to choose this framework.

But, there is one thing we can surely recommend to you — usage of multiple attribution models. As it is the only way to look at the data from different angles and get all the possible insights from numbers behind your marketing.

In order to do that, you have to choose software that allows an easy switch between multiple attribution models.
Marketing conversion attribution software

So whether you promote the latest weight loss products or online websites with games like Book of Ra, it's vital to pick the right strategies to stand out. And since you make your revenue from people clicking on your ads, becoming successful in PPC affiliate marketing starts from building an audience who's eager to follow your content. How do you do that? The recipe for success is to pick a niche, stay true to it, and produce lots of valuable articles on your chosen topic. But here's the hard part: if you want to stay one step ahead of your competitors, you need to be as efficient as possible in your keyword research. And that brings us to the topic of this article: using the best available keyword tools. We'll uncover the latest software and strategies to make sure you'll drive highly targeted traffic from the search engines to your affiliate pages. Sounds good? Let's take a closer look!
Here's Why Keyword Research Matters for PPC affiliates
Anyone who wants to make a decent living with pay-per-click affiliate programs needs to do it on a massive scale. But that's possible only by keeping your keywords relevant. Unless you update them consistently, to only use the most competitive ones, your rival companies might win the upper hand by embedding more popular keywords into their content.

However, keep in mind that it's not enough to get lots of visitors to your affiliate sites. If you want to make money and drive sales, you also need to target the prospects. And there's no better way to do that than using long-tail keywords. Why's that? Because whoever finds you via a search intent expressed using multiple words or even a sentence knows already what they want. They have a clear interest in products and services similar to yours.' You only need to do the last bit of convincing to get the prospect to buy from you.
How to Find Your Niche
Profitable PPC affiliates know that covering too many niches results in the superficial treatment of topics. And that doesn't attract visitors to the content. But picking only one theme enables a marketer to go into details and provide the audience with lots of valuable advice. That way, it's possible for affiliates to grow authority in time, which drives an increasing amount of leads to their websites.

But keep in mind that some niches are more profitable than others. So while it's true that it will be easier for you to produce content when picking topics you're passionate about, you should also consider the popularity of your themes. Here's how to find a niche that interests you and others also:

 	Examine your and your friends' pastime activities. What hobbies are you/they passionate about? Whether it's collecting something, repairing cars, or fishing, you and your friends are probably willing to spend a good amount of cash on supplies and gear.
 	Consider promoting accessories. For example, there's always a demand for supplement gear for specialty goods (cars, photo cameras).
 	Take a look at Google Trends. It's a free source of inspiration that shows you all the niches that people care about at the moment.

How to Use Keyword Research Tools
Did you manage to pick your niche? Then it's time to get to the keyword research. And luckily, thanks to the availability of many different keyword software, the process of finding search terms your audience uses has never been more simple. All you need to do in most programs is to integrate your account on Google Ads PPC and enter your industry and location. The software will then give you lots of actionable information that can help you get more people to click on your ads.

But what are the best tools that are most important for affiliate PPCs to use? Here's a list of our top 3 software:

 	SemRush is excellent to uncover keywords that successful companies in your niche are already using. It also provides an overview of keyword difficulty, which informs you how much effort it will take to get to the top of search results.
 	KwFinder is useful when you have a business that ships internationally. It gives you target keywords in most languages and shows you statistics on their competitiveness.
 	Google keyword planner doesn't have all the functionalities of other tools. However, it gives you some of the most accurate data on keywords you can get.

Keyword Research Tools Help PPC Affiliates Create Better Ads
Another reason why PPC marketers should use the keyword tools is that finding and using the most relevant search terms help to make the ad copy more eye-catching. A headline that addresses an issue the product aims to solve for your target audience hooks them. And once you've got their attention, the rest of the ad copy should entice viewers to click further to your affiliate pages. Here's an additional tip: you can make the ad even more compelling by choosing to feature keywords that are action verbs.
Final words
So this was our quick overview of why PPC affiliates need better keyword tools and how to use these to maximize earnings per click. The bottom line is that you can reap the benefits of pay-per-click advertising only if you attract enough targeted traffic to your sites. And that's possible only by using the right keywords in your content and ads. So the software you use to find these search terms is perhaps the most vital tool in your arsenal. Pick any of the three programs we recommended in this article, and you'll be able to find the most relevant keywords that will help you boost your click rates. What could be better?

On the ad set level, you are going to choose your audience for targeting and where you are gonna lead with your ad (for example, to the website). 

Again, Meta algorithms allow you to target people by certain interests and behaviors and you can explore variety on ad set level. 


Ads level 
On the Ad level, you can choose to upload your ad creatives.



Here you will also find tracking parameters easy to use for tracking the performance of your Facebook ad campaigns. With the right setup of your tracking, you will find which creative is responsible for high ROI and revenue and therefore will be able to optimize for better results. 
Great things about Facebook (Meta) Ads Manager 
Once you launch your campaigns, ad sets, and ads and start getting some traction on your advertising, you will see the numbers of your performance unfolding in reports in Ads Manager.

Meta Ads Manager allows you to see all the metrics you wanna know about your ads: clicks, cost per click, reach, amount spent, etc. Also, you can look into breakdowns and see how each location, gender, age group performs to understand how to target your ads better.

If you have your Facebook Pixel and Facebook CAPI set up, you will also know the conversion rates on your ad campaigns and the revenue they bring to your business. Facebook will attribute conversions and sales to a particular campaign or ad set.

However, many advertisers stop the exploration of FB Business Suite with Ads Manager. 
But advanced targeting and optimization are only unlocked for those who dig deeper into Events Manager. So let’s learn how it works. 
What is Facebook Events Manager 
Facebook Events Manager is a place where you can manage how Facebook gathers data about events from Facebook Pixel of API integration and what kind of events you want to keep track of. 
To put it simply, Facebook Events Manager allows to collect and consolidate the data about purchases and other conversions events (view content, add-to-cart, etc.).
And since purchases (aka conversions) are the very reason why you are doing FB ads, you should take Events Manager super seriously and take care of the accurate setup.
Why Events Manager is so important?
Events Manager is basically a rocket fuel for Facebook optimization. Events manager deliver this precious data that is used for further analysis and optimizing your campaign for better results. 
Advanced optimization &amp; improved targeting after Events Manager configuration
Facebook (Meta) optimizes your advertising campaigns based on the data that Events Manager gatherers through Pixel or API integrations. Everything that the Events Manager will receive will be used to improve targeting mechanism. Therefore, the more data you are able to gather in Events Manager — the better. 

Moreover, optimization based on conversions (conversion objective for your ad campaign in Ads Manager) will be possible only after the configuration of Events Manager and after the needed event will get enough traction. A special protocol by Facebook, Aggregated Events Measurement (AEM) is responsible for it.  
Advanced remarketing with Events Manager
Based on the events you configure in Events Manager, you can create custom audiences and use it for advanced remarketing. For example, if you have an “abandoned cart” event set up in your Event Manager, later you can create ads and target this specific group of users to drive purchase intent. 
Online and offline events in FB Events Manager 
There are different types of events you can use on Facebook. There are online and offline events.

Offline conversion events are the type of events that happen in your CRM, example. For example, if you want to configure purchases that were recorded in your CRM, you would need to set up this event in Events Manager and then perform offline conversion upload. 

Online events are divided into standard events that Facebook has a template for and custom conversions. These events are recorded by Facebook with use of Facebook Pixel or Facebook CAPI to feed FB algorithms.
The biggest difference between online and offline events is the access to fclid. 
Fclid — is a special click ID identified by Facebook that helps bind a unique click on a Facebook ad with a conversion that happened later on.

Online events have a record of a fclid, while offline events don’t. That’s why you will need an alternative tool in order to upload your offline conversions to Facebook. 
Since offline events have no special FB id, there has to be hashed (anonymized) personal data like a phone number or email address in order to make attribution possible. 

At RedTrack, you can use the offline conversion upload feature in order to perform this task without any hassle. 



&nbsp;

Officially, Meta says that offline conversion upload does not improve optimization or targeting. But what we know for sure, is that it helps to see more accurate attribution reports. 
What are Data Sources in Events Manager? 
Data Sources are places where the conversion events data is gathered for further work on attribution and optimization. 
Data sources are sort of buckets that gather the data, later FB will take this data to perform attribution and then optimize your campaigns for further results. 
Your trusted “buckets” are Facebook Pixel and Facebook CAPI. 

Generally, Data sources are divided as web, offline, and app. 
Why Events Manager and Ads Manager show different conversion data?

One of our missions at RedTrack is to help advertisers fight limitations that appeared after iOS 14 update on Facebook Ads arena.
Yet, one of the most important questions our users have is this one:
“But why do I see X number of conversions in Events Manager, Y number of conversions in Ads Manager and Z number of conversion in my RedTrack account?”
Well, in order to understand this difference we have to understand how Facebook attribution works. 

But the short answer would be Facebook attribution models. 
Facebook is using data modeling when showing conversions in Ads Manager. It means that FB is showing a hypothesis of how conversions happened and which campaigns contributed to the result. 
Events Manager gets the data about events and then Facebook takes this data and processes it by building an attribution model of the performance of your campaigns. It means that numbers in Ads Manager are not precise.

In the meantime, RedTrack is working independently gathering conversion data and also matching it across all of your advertising channels. We use only raw 1st party data and we do not support data modeling and aggregation. 

So when RedTrack sends conversion data to Events Manager, Facebook applies its attribution logic, and in the end Ads Manager shows conversion data in FB logic (meaning modeled and aggregated).
Let’s take a look at the scheme below to understand how it works. 


Imagine that you had 20 sales on Shopify and take a look at the data flow. 
RedTrack has captured 20 events: 5 of them were offline and 15 — online. 
Your FB Pixel captured only 15 because it can not record offline events.
Data appears in Data sources through FB CAPI and Pixel. RedTrack allows to upload those 5 offline conversions and send 15 online conversions automatically through Facebook Conversion API.
Then data from the Data source is taken by Facebook for some machine-learning time: processing and modeling. 

Once data has been modeled, you see numbers on your performance appear in Ads Manager. 

It will contain modeled conversion data for online events and simply attributed data for offline events. 
And what you see in the end, is a different number of attributed conversions in Ads Manager. 


This same machine learning uses all the data from Data sources for optimization of your campaigns in Ads Manager. 
9 Steps to accelerate growth with Events Manager setup
Now when we discovered what is Ads Manager and what is Events Manager, let’s learn how to make them work together effectively. 

Remember that Events Manager is rocket fuel for your optimization? So let’s see how to achieve these results.
1. Don’t ignore Facebook CAPI
We know that many marketers still stick to Facebook Pixel. We have an explanation why Facebook Pixel is not a viable solution in 2022, so do consider setting up Facebook Conversion API as well. 


2. Verify your domain 
Domain verification is an essential step for your Facebook (Meta) Ads in 2022. It ensures privacy-friendly environment that Facebook is sicking right now. Also, without domain verification events configuration is not possible. 
If you are an affiliate marketer and you have no direct access to the domain, make sure to follow our guide on domain verification.  
3. Set up events in Events Manager 
Each domain can have up to 8 conversion events set up. Be sure to choose the right events needed for your Facebook advertising. And don’t forget that you can use both: Standard Facebook events and set up custom conversion events. 


4. Configure your events
Test your configuration and don’t forget that events in Events Manager need “warming up”. It means that they should receive enough traction and the event has to receive around 20-30 conversions.

If your advertising isn’t that active or you are testing on low budgets, consider using the fake conversion upload method to speed up the warming up of your events.

RedTrack allows doing that with a conversion upload feature.
5. Prioritize events 
When you warmed up the events you will be able to choose prioritization. Events Manager can have up to 8 events and it uses a prioritization model. This means that the first event will have the biggest priority for the optimization and the last event will have the least. 
6. Choose the right campaign objective
After all the previous steps you can launch your new campaigns and expect better optimization towards conversions (purchases) if you choose the right campaign objective. 
If you are driving advertising campaigns for a very reason of conversions we recommend using the “conversions” objective. And all the work we’ve done up to this point helps us achieve a great result.
7. Check your conversion window
After iOS 14 update Facebook conversion window changed to a 7-day click and 1-day view (which was a severe cut of the conversion window). But Facebook can also automatically switch you to a 1-day click window, make sure to turn it back to 7-day. 

By the way, at RedTrack we offer up to 56-day conversion window. So the conversions you will see in RedTrack account performance dashboard could be dated to a very “old click”. 

Facebook might not accept this conversion data as it supports up to 7-day conversion window, but at least you can see a more accurate performance report in your RedTrack reports and make further conclusions. 
8. Use data from the Events manager for remarketing 
One of the greatest advantages of using an Events Manager setup is the usage of advanced remarketing. You can create custom audiences in your Events Manager that are based on events (like add-to-cart).



Then choose this audience for targeting when launching your new campaign and enjoy a very personalized approach to advertising. 
9. Consider using broad targeting
As Facebook receives way fewer data after iOS devices are cut off from tracking as we used to know it, FB algorithms did suffer a few changes and we all felt that the performance dropped.

 However, FB algorithms are still a crazy advanced technology, just consider giving it more freedom to find your perfect customer. 

Choose broad targeting when launching your next ad campaign and compare results to a usual ad setup. 


Final words
Whew! That was a lot! But I hope it was all the necessary info for you to accelerate your marketing with the use of Facebook advertising tools like Ads Manager and Events Manager. 

If you are looking for a technological partner that can take up the heavy lifting behind Facebook Conversion API technology, be sure to check out RedTrack’s Facebook conversion tracking solution.

9278,5 changes in Google Privacy Sandbox 2022,"Did you see scary titles about Google Privacy Sandbox for Android and move to Google Analytics 4? Do you need more information to understand what’s going on with marketing and measuring performance in 2022? Google Privacy Sandbox is one of the biggest cookieless initiatives in the industry, but it had some serious changes in 2022. 

So this article is here for you to learn about 5 changes that happened to GPS and that you should be aware of to be prepared for all the cookieless changes.

If you have never heard about Google Privacy Sandbox, first check this video that explains the background and the theory behind this topic.


Why Google changes agenda
We can see that Google is taking its time to implement Google Privacy Sandbox and with every iteration, it takes even longer to fulfill this transition. The reason for that is that Google makes huge advertising revenue. 

That means that Google can not just cut off advertisers from the tools they used because it will influence directly their profits.
The more you make as an advertiser, the more you invest in ads, and the more Google profits from it. 
So it takes a lot of time for Google to move forward with the new privacy-friendly ecosystem because they still can not figure out how to make it possible for us, marketers and advertisers do our job, earn money and therefore, contribute to Google making money. 
All the technologies are carefully tested before being applied for your use. And that’s why it keeps getting postponed! 
5 changes in Google Privacy Sandbox
Now let’s talk about the latest Google updates regarding Privacy Sandbox, but drift away from complex protocols and talk about real marketing language and what it means for marketers. 


1. Privacy Sandbox introduced on Android 
It’s not released yet, but Google called it a “multi-year” initiative. That means that the same troubles we had with ad tracking on Apple devices are just around the corner for Android. 
If you watched our video about digital marketing trends and predictions in 2022, then it wouldn't be a surprise for you as we talked about this change coming. There is no magic involved, just it's pretty obvious that it's getting harder and harder to perform cookie-tracking on all types of devices because of all privacy initiatives. 


What does it mean for us?
Now the majority of the advertising traffic was moved to Andriod for the very reason that tracking is still pretty much accurate. Soon this loophole will be closed as well, so privacy-friendly tracking is a must for your advertising.
As Google states: 

""We realize that other platforms have taken a different approach to ads privacy, bluntly restricting existing technologies used by developers and advertisers. We believe that — without first providing a privacy-preserving alternative path — such approaches can be ineffective and lead to worse outcomes for user privacy and developer businesses.""
Clearly pointing out to Apple's iOS 14 being a sudden change for advertisers, Google shows one more time that they can not create limitations for advertisers out of the blue. Everything has to be prepared to provide a quality advertisement.

By the way, RedTrack's solution for ad tracking and conversion attribution has adapted as soon as possible to changes from iOS 14 influencing Facebook Ads. So be sure to join us to entrust technology adaptation to us.

2. Targeting &amp; remarketing changes 
Earlier Google announced an initiative called FLoC (Federal learning of cohorts) to introduce privacy-friendly targeting &amp; remarketing.
FLoC was meant to become interest-based advertising where users were put in groups (and therefore, targeted in groups). This was supposed to keep private user information anonymous. However, Google announced that this protocol will never see the light of day.

The new interest-based targeting initiative is called Topic API. 

Based on the actions user performs, Google will be forming topics aka interest-based groups. And then later you as the advertiser will be able to target those topics or groups without personal information involved in the process. 

FLEDGE is another protocol that allows you to do remarketing by adding users to groups based on certain actions. Basically, it’s creating custom audiences based on user interaction. But again, it’s supposed to be privacy-friendly and none of the information will be shared openly (everything is stored on a user side). 
3. Measuring digital ads
Google has tested Attribution reporting for a while now to stop relying on 3rd party cookies for measurement of performance and recording touchpoints in the user funnel. 
One of the updates in this niche is Summary reports (previously called Aggregated reports). 
“Summary reports provide an aggregated view of detailed conversion data while retaining critical information for reporting, without the ability to identify individual users within that data. Event-level reporting added new features for third-party reporting, view-through measurement, filtering reports, and debugging functionality.”
Privacy is ensured through data aggregation and modeling.
What does it mean for advertisers?
Summary (or Aggregated) reports mean that we will have less of accurate data when measuring the performance of our advertisement. Since data aggregation leaves you with a model of the performance, you do not have a clear picture of all the clicks and the conversions that happened. The alternative for data aggregation is raw data. Raw data ensures that you have every single click recorded for your advertising and attributed to the right campaign.

However, this API is already available for testing so if you are one of the geeky developers, feel free! 
4. Moving to Google Analytics 4
Even though it’s not a part of the Google Sandbox initiative, it’s an important update of 2022/23 and part of a privacy-friendly movement on a global scale. Universal GA will stop processing hits on July the 1st 2023 and the move to GA4 will be inevitable. 
GA 4 does not rely on cookies, uses event-based modeling, and is future-proof in comparison to Universal GA. 

But many marketers are not quite happy to see a new Google Analytics 4 as compulsory as it means losing some features we loved and also transitioning to a different UI.
I recommend getting familiar with Google Analytics 4 as fast as possible. But if you want to get the most from marketing analytics, consider looking for GA alternatives. 
5. Preventing cross-site tracking 
Google calls this process ""strengthen cross-site privacy boundaries"".

It all sounds very complicated and you might wonder: what the heck is it? It’s the same old song about the elimination of third-party cookies and preventing cross-site tracking aka privacy-oriented digital spaces. 

Well, here we have a lot of APIs and protocols in progress: 

 	First party sets
 	Shared storage API
 	Fenced Frames API
 	CHIPS

I don’t think it’s really necessary for our marketing minds to stuff ourselves with this information. I will give a single simple insight about it — do not ignore the elimination of third-party cookies and invest in first-party data tracking and attribution. We have been talking about it on our blog and YT channel for a while now. So be sure to prepare yourself for a cookieless future. 

At RedTrack, we step out as a privacy-friendly marketing analytics tool to measure the performance of all of your marketing channels without 3rd party cookies. And by the way, whenever another scary update is rolled out, we adapt our solutions to be fully compliant and create a bunch of articles and videos to give you insights on this topic!

9293,Are Native Ads Still Popular?,"In Westworld's pilot episode, a protagonist asks his humanoid hostess if she's ""real"".

She replied: ""Well if you can't tell, does it matter?"" 

How can you tell if native advertising is an ad if it looks exactly like regular content? This is its main advantage: most times, readers may not realize they are interacting with an ad if it appears similar to regular content. There are no clear rules or guidelines for how advertisers should label native ads; standards for transparency vary widely. So in this article, we discuss what native advertising means and how to use it in your marketing campaigns.
What is native advertising?
Native ads are a type of advertising designed to blend in with the look and feel of the platform it appears on. 

These ads can appear in video format, an article or editorial, or even a well-designed display ad. In essence, ""native"" means something viewers will naturally interact with without feeling annoyed or confused. Native advertising formats like the Social Bar inherit some of the UX practices along with gamification and engagement techniques.
Types and formats of native advertising
Let's review the most popular types of native advertisements:
1. Native banners
The native banner is a traditional ad format with a captivating image and headline that blends in seamlessly with a website's content. Native banners typically appear in the most visible areas of a webpage, leading to higher viewability and interaction rates than standard ads.

[caption id=""attachment_9295"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""656""] Example of native advertising[/caption]
2. In-feed ads
Campaign goal: raise brand awareness and drive more traffic to the advertiser's website.

Type: social media promoted campaigns (sponsored Facebook posts, promoted pins on Pinterest, etc.).

User engagement: following the brand's social media page, liking the post or commenting on it, and clicking the post's links.
Promoted posts help business owners reach a larger audience through social media. This ad format takes advantage of social media's high virality potential, which means that people are more likely to share your ads with their friends and peers.
&nbsp;
3. Search ads


Campaign goal: boost traffic by attracting people who use relevant keywords in their search queries. 

Sponsored offers appear higher than organic offers on a ""Search results"" page.

User engagement: clicking on a link in the listing or interacting with the website. 

Advertisers can pay for listings on most search engines. While the format isn't platform-specific, mobile sponsored announcements are typically longer and more detailed than their desktop variants.
4. Suggested content
You've probably noticed the sponsored content in the recommendations section of a news or content site. Sponsored content often has the style and format of an editorial piece: even the most basic ad resembles a newspaper or magazine article.


5. Social Bar (display and in-page push combo)

Examples of interstitial ads within Social bar: 



Social Bar is a display and in-page push ads combo that can appear as:

 	system notifications (ideal for VPNs, antiviruses, and apps);
 	icons and widgets;
 	chat heads or messages from a messenger app;
 	interstitials and many other formats.

Social Bar works great on desktop and mobile devices, making it an ideal replacement for classic native ad formats. It matches user patterns genuinely, especially those of Gen Z and millennials.
As Adsterra's Social Bar combines the benefits of display and in-page push ads, the advertiser's goal to compel users becomes much more feasible. Its template creatives (available for every Self-Serve Platform user) have proved to return up to 30X CTRs along with increased CR.
How to launch a native advertising campaign
Advertisers can run AdBlock-resistant and cost-effective CPC and CPM native ad campaigns with Adsterra. 

Both Native Banners and Social Bar are available on the Self-Serve Platform and on managed accounts. Here’s how to launch them:

 	After you sign up or log in, go to your dashboard and click Campaign → Create from the hamburger menu.
 	Select the available pricing model (you can choose between CPM and CPC).
 	Pick Native Banner, Social Bar, or In-Page Push as the AdUnit category.
 	Fill in all other required fields: pick the type of traffic you need, the connection type, and the devices you will target. 
 	Add your landing page URL with previews.
 	Choose your target country, and Adsterra smart algorithms will recommend the optimal bidding strategy.
 	Add creatives for your native ad campaign; you can upload up to 15 visuals and add up to 15 headings to discover the top-converting combinations faster.

General settings are enough to submit your native ad campaign for verification. It is better to start your test campaign with broad targets as it will give you more info on how to optimize your campaign in the future.


Why native advertising is popular among online marketers
1. Native advertising is effective
Native ads are viewed 53% more than most types of display ads. Native advertising also increases purchase intent by 18%, and visual engagement with native ads is on par with original content.
2. Native advertising effectively combats ad fatigue 
Ad fatigue happens when an audience becomes bored with seeing advertisements and simply stops paying attention to them after a while. Native ads expose your brand while hiding under natural content, so your audience isn't exhausted. This type of advertising engages the audience as long as the ad is relevant and exciting.

Interacting with sponsored content is simple and enjoyable when it matches the website's style. 
In terms of CTR and engagement, native ads outperform annoying pop-ups and bulky banners.
3. Native ads do not hurt website performance
Reputable publishers prefer native ad formats because they don’t hurt website performance. For example, a website user experience will remain the same regardless of how many sponsored posts they publish. Native banners are also responsive, automatically adjusting to different screen sizes.
4. Native ads are viral among millennials
Most marketing campaigns, without a doubt, are aimed at millennials. This generation has achieved financial stability, is aware of its needs, and is willing to spend money to achieve its objectives. Mobile native ads are preferred by millennials over other ad formats, with 80% stating that this format provides a positive user experience.
5. Which niches benefit from native advertising?

 	Software and AddOns 

Native advertising will ensure your programs and extensions will appear only on related blogs and websites. 

 	Apps and utilities

Users will undoubtedly come across your next freemium or subscription offer while reading or simply browsing through tech articles.

 	Dating

The key to success is having a high level of visibility and relevance. Adsterra places your dating ads on the most relevant websites, where visitors are more likely to visit your landing page or download your app.

 	Crypto

Advertise your crypto services in topic-related content to reach the most engaged audience. For maximum impact, Adsterra rotates ads on trading and finance-related resources.

 	E-commerce

Native ads are more effective than traditional display banners in promoting fashion accessories, embroidered clothing and other apparel, as well as electronics.

 	Nutra, health, wellness

Your ad for a supplement or immune booster blends in with the rest of the website's content. It's an excellent way to attract motivated customers who are ready to buy.

 	Education and business

When workshops, courses, and webinars are advertised natively, they attract more purchase-ready and loyal users.
Why native ads are effective [statistics to back it up]
Native advertising is highly effective and provides a significant competitive advantage to businesses. Let's look at some statistics from Marketing Land, eMarketer, Adsterra, Hubspot, and other sources.

 	Native ads have a CTR 40 times higher than display ads. (ignitevisibility)
 	In the coming years, native advertising will take over 25% of the market.
 	70% of people prefer sponsored articles over display advertisements for learning about products.
 	Native ads were not considered advertisements by nearly 77% of respondents. (fastcompany)
 	Around 44% of people were unable to identify the advertiser in the advertisement they were reading.
 	The global native advertising spend is expected to increase by 372% between 2020 and 2025.
 	Based on overall digital ad spend growth, the native ad market is expected to grow to $402 billion in 2025. (PRNewswire)
 	In North America, native advertising will grow by 37%. (deepnativeadvertising)

Return on investment for native advertising
Native ads account for over 80% of Audience Network impressions, according to Facebook. For example, native ads increased revenue by 40% for Gametion, a mobile game app. (appsamurai)
3 tips for creating native advertising campaigns
Use the native ad best practices to master native advertising and ensure your ads survive the fierce competition.
1. Make your ad look like organic content 
Most users trust the platforms they use frequently, so they'll click on content similar to what they've seen. As an advertiser, you'll want to make sure the tone and visual style of your sponsored post-match what the publisher has on their blog.

[caption id=""attachment_9300"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""559""] native ad example[/caption]

Use these simple strategies to ensure your post blends in seamlessly:

 	Make a list of 4-5 natural posts that inspire you (because they are funny, informative, or have epic visuals).
 	Make a list of posts that resonated with the audience and figure out what characteristics of these articles made them perform better than others.
 	Create a list of 3-4 successful sponsored ads and determine what factors contributed to their success.

When your post is finished, run it by the editorial team to see if it follows the platform's publishing guidelines.
2. Ensure that your website is ready for mobile visitors
You can expect smartphone users to visit your site, and you don't want them to be disappointed by a lack of responsiveness or usability. If your ads are mobile-friendly, your website must welcome mobile users as well ;)
3. Create reusable ad templates and use spy tools
Advertisers talk a lot about originality and creativity when coming up with ideas. Successful professionals place a high value on feasibility — the ability to create quality ads faster.

Try to make your ad templates as reusable as possible to avoid bottlenecks. To ensure you never run out of sponsored post ideas, use design templates, a defined structure, and a well-thought-out editorial plan. This approach will save you time during ad design and help you focus on looking for new promotion tools.
Conclusion
When native ads are combined with relevant content or provide great UX, users are more likely to interact with them. More advertisers are learning how to incorporate native advertising into their campaigns to increase brand awareness, and conversions as the benefits of native advertising become more apparent. By incorporating native banners and Social Bar into your advertising strategy, you will access a whole new world of publishers, resulting in increased exposure and traffic. What’s great is that you can test your native campaign with multiple different native ad creatives in rotation to see which one converts and saves budgets from the start.",4/11/2022,https://redtrack.io/blog/are-native-ads-still-popular/,digital marketing
9316,Zero-party data VS first-party data: why you should not forget about first-party?,"It all started with one LinkedIn post. Then another one. Then I saw it’s not just sporadic info, but rather a HUGE trend for zero-party data content and solutions, even companies being created for its sake. I wanted to figure out why so much buzz and understand whether it can possibly substitute first-party data. 

That is how this blog post was born: in pursuit to get it all right between all types of customer data: 3rd party, 1st party, and the newbie — zero-party data.
In this article, we will go over the difference between all these data types, as well as understand whether zero-party data is worth the hype created around it. 


Types of customer data
Apparently, we all marketers were just fine figuring out how to live with 3,2,1. I mean, third-party, second-party, and first-party data. When we sorta reached the peak of this mountain range (let’s call it Big 3 to save my time writing this again and again), a new mountain started to clear out of nowhere — zero-party data. 

Let’s try to understand the main difference between those types of data. 

&nbsp;
Third-party, first-party and zero-party data at a glance



Third-party
First-party
Zero-party


It is indirect customer data, usually aggregated and collected without the direct consent of the user to share this information. Usually inaccurate and not reliable. 
Direct customer data, but collected with all the privacy regulations taken care of and with the consent of the user. It is the data of high accuracy that you can rely on for advertising &amp; marketing purposes.
Direct customer data that the user willingly shared with the brand. It is accurate and reliable, usually helps understand the customer better and identify preferred communication ways.  




 	Email
 	Income 
 	Website visits
 	Search history




 	Email
 	Website visits 
 	Click data 
 	Conversion data




 	Email 
 	Age
 	Communication preferences 
 	Personal details 





As you can see, there are not many differences in the data itself, but rather the differences are in the way this data is collected. Also, the trustworthiness of the data differs from one type to another. 
Let’s go over each type and try to understand better how it works. 
What is third-party data? 
Third-party data is indirect customer data collected without the users' consent for using it.
Third-party data used to be collected through website cookies and include all the customer info. Usually, this data is obtained through aggregators, is easily resold and the reliability is really questionable. 

It used to work the following way: various companies collect users’ data through cookies and then resell it through various third-party data marketplaces. 
Another way you might have been using third-party data is by using Facebook pixel or any other old-fashioned tracking methods. Those technologies are also enabled by 3rd party cookies. 

Even though third-party data improves advertising &amp; targeting, there are serious disadvantages of relying only on this type of data in 2022. 
Disadvantages of third-party data

 	It can be inaccurate because the technologies are outdated 
 	It’s getting harder to use third-party data for optimization &amp; targeting because of the cookieless changes in the industry
 	This data is usually not individual and raw, but rather aggregated

What is first-party data?
First-party data is the data you collect directly from your organic &amp; paid channels with the users' consent. 
Data comes from paid advertising, your website, as well as other marketing channels. 
Examples of first-party data include:

 	Demographics
 	Website activity
 	Email engagement
 	Click data
 	Conversion data 
 	Conversion path data 

When privacy regulations appeared in the day-to-day life of marketers, the value of first-party data skyrocketed.
First-party data ensures this privacy and avoid the difficulties caused by cookieless updates because it’s gathered in a privacy-friendly way. 
Biggest advantage of first-party data for your advertising 
Not only first-party data is accurate and privacy-compliant, but it also serves as a magic boost for your advertising. 
All the data collected from users' interaction with advertising, website, and the product can and should be used for optimization, targeting, and remarketing which improves the way you allocate your advertising budget.


For example, first-party data can help you map a conversion path of the user by detecting every click on his/her way before they make a final purchase. 
Or you can create complicated funnels according to the individual interaction of the user with the website. E.g. he added something to the cart, but later abandoned it. You can retarget this or similar products to this user.
Raw first-party data is that source that enables the technology for optimization and crazy algorithms. 
And finally, what is zero-party data? 
It's the data that user has every single intention to share with your brand. That means that you also have the consent to use this data. Usually, it's the data that you receive through forms on your website, or you can also get it through support chats, for example.

The most common example of zero-party data is communication preference: when a customer shares with you email or phone number and gives permission to contact him or her that way.

But you can collect much more through zero-party data: age, personal details (like clothes size, skin type, employment status, etc.), place of residence, languages spoken. Basically, it can be anything that is relevant to your brand.
And why exactly do we need zero-party data? 
Depending on the type of business that you run you might find different ways to use zero-party.
1) You can improve communication with your customers
By knowing what is the best channel for communication, you can achieve better response &amp; communication results for your sales (or any other) team.

You can also benefit from an omnichannel contact center approach by adopting a suitable solution for that.
2) You can improve messaging
Not only zero-party data is useful for sales teams, but also for marketing departments. You can use this data for better messaging, positioning, and overall understanding of your target audience. By carefully crafting those forms and choosing to ask the right questions, the answer will help you understand the real pains of your customers which you can use in campaigns.
3) You can create a better product
When receiving zero-party answers from your customers, you can understand how to craft the product for it to answer all the requirements of the user.
Zero-party data will be useful for product managers and C-level employees to start new initiatives.
What’s the main difference between first-party and zero-party data? 
You can see that first-party and zero-party data often overlap, except few important data elements: data collected through paid channels. Here I'm talking about conversion data, click data, etc.

And here can be found the main difference between these types of data. First-party data collected through your paid ads can be used to improve your paid performance by feeding algorithms. In this regard, first-party data becomes a big boost to your efforts in advertising and serves for better performance on every dollar invested in paid ads.

As an example, by choosing RedTrack as your marketing analytics solution that collects first-party data through our privacy-compliant technologies from all the marketing channels you use, you can choose to send this data back to Facebook &amp; Google for algorithms to do their jobs better. Besides, having all the performance data in one dashboard will help you understand which channels you should scale and which are better to cut.

On the contrary, even though zero-party data is very good to understand your customers, communicate with them, and craft amazing messaging, it will not help you advertise better.
Finally, is zero-party data worth the hype? 
Even though LinkedIn gurus create an image that 0-party data is the new black, I have to disagree with its exclusive importance. Yes, it’s super important to collect as much data directly from a customer to build better marketing personas, improve the ways you communicate with your audience, to improve your understanding of your TA. 

However, zero-party data can not replace the capabilities of first-party data in times of cookieless updates. 

The answer is to join the forces of two powerful tools: first-party and zero-party.

Zero-party data will be serving in the front line, while first-party data will be contributing from the back end.

If you want to improve your advertising efforts with the power given by first-party data and marketing analytics, find RedTrack as your trusted partner in taking the numbers and delivering them right in the hands of algorithms of advertising networks (like Facebook and Google).

Affiliate marketing is one of the best ways to start your business and learning how to do it is crucial to your success as an online entrepreneur. You don’t need any startup budget, there are no business expenses, no worries about profitability — all you have to do is just join an affiliate program and promote their products or services to your audience.

 Let’s dive into the basics of affiliate marketing and take a look at the list of top 10 affiliate marketing programs for beginners.
What’s affiliate marketing and how does it work?
Affiliate marketing is an advertising model in which a company pays third-party publishers for generating traffic or leads to their products or services and taking the desired action. 
The third-party publishers, also known as affiliates, are incentivized to earn a commission for providing a specific result, be it sales, leads, etc. 

The result is tracked with an affiliate link, which helps to monitor the number of clicks, typically using cookies. The cookie tracks the user, as well as validates purchases and conversions thanks to its ‘length’ or ‘cookie life’. As a result, if the users perform the desired action within a certain period, an affiliate earns a commission.  

So the flow is simple — the higher your performance is, the more you get. Sounds easy, but with so many programs to choose from, it’s so easy to get lost. You need to consider your options first, and going through the list of top affiliate marketing programs is the best way to start.

In this article, we will discuss the 13 most important aspects of building an affiliate site in 2023. Keep reading to learn everything you need to know!

How to build a successful affiliate site: 13 steps
When it comes to building an affiliate site, there are a few key things you need to focus on in order to be successful. So let’s get right into it. 
Here are 13 tips to keep in mind as you work on building your affiliate site.

1. Choose a profitable niche
When building an affiliate site, it is important to choose a niche that will be profitable. There are a few factors to consider when choosing a niche, such as the level of competition, the potential for growth, and the commission structure. 
For example, a niche with a lot of competition may be more difficult to break into but could be more profitable in the long run. A niche with high potential for growth may be less competitive but could also have a lower commission rate. 
As an affiliate, it is important to do your research and choose a niche that will be the most advantageous for you. With the right niche, you can build a successful affiliate site that will generate income for years to come.

Examples of profitable niches in 2023:

 	Finance
 	Fitness
 	Lifestyle
 	Technology
 	Pets
 	Gaming
 	Travel

2. Create high-quality content
When it comes to affiliate marketing, the success of your site depends largely on the quality of your content. After all, you’re working to attract readers who are interested in what you have to say and offer. 
If your content is poorly written or doesn’t offer value, you’re not likely to earn many conversions. 
On the other hand, high-quality content can not only help you build a loyal following and generate conversions but also help you rank higher in the SERPs.

How can you create content that drives results?
Start by addressing the needs of your target audience. What are they looking for? How can you help them? Once you know what your readers want, you can begin creating engaging, informative articles, blog posts, and even product reviews that will resonate with your audience.


Remember, the key to successful affiliate marketing is creating content that provides value to your readers.

With quality content, you can build a loyal following, generate leads, and make sales.

3. Track your results and optimize campaigns
When building an affiliate site, it's important to track your results so you can optimize your campaigns. By tracking your results, you'll be able to see which methods are working and which ones aren't. 
This will allow you to make changes to your campaigns so that you can get the most out of them. There are a number of ways to track your results - a free and easy option is to use Google Analytics. 
Google Analytics provides detailed information about website traffic and can help you to identify where your visitors are coming from. This information can be used to adjust your campaigns accordingly. Another way to track your results is through marketing attribution software. This software allows you to track sales, clicks, and conversions so you can see which of your campaigns are performing the best. By tracking your results, you can ensure that your campaigns are as effective as possible.


4. Use AI to optimize your content for search engines
If you're looking to build an affiliate site, one of the most important things you can do is to optimize your content for search engines. And one of the best ways to do that is to use AI. There are a number of AI tools available such as SurferSEO that can help you with everything from keyword research to optimizing your title tags, meta description, and keyword density. 
But perhaps the most important thing AI can do is help you create better content. By analyzing your existing content and that of your competitors, AI can help you identify areas where you can improve. 
These tools can also perform an audit of your website to help come up with new ideas for content and SEO improvements that will help you rank highly in search results. So if you're serious about building a successful affiliate site, consider using AI to optimize your content.

5. Build backlinks to your site
When it comes to affiliate marketing or any other SEO-related efforts, building backlinks is essential. By creating links from other websites back to your own, you can dramatically increase the visibility and authority of your site. 
Not only will this help to attract more visitors, but it will also lead to higher search engine rankings.
In addition, backlinks can also help to build relationships with other website owners and improve the overall quality of your site. As a result, if you're not already building backlinks as part of your affiliate marketing strategy, you're missing out on a key opportunity to boost your business.
Use a tool like the Ahrefs backlink checker to check the backlink profile and domain rating of sites in your niche.


6. Use social media to promote your site
As an affiliate marketer, one of your key goals is to drive traffic to your site. Social media can be a powerful tool to help you achieve this goal. By using relevant hashtags with the help of a hashtag generator tool and sharing links to your site on social media, you can reach a wider audience and promote your brand. 
In addition, social media can be used to build relationships with websites you’d like to partner with. 
By engaging with them on social media, you can create a rapport that may convince them to visit your site and collaborate.

7. Use paid advertising to promote your site
In the early days of affiliate marketing, many sites relied heavily on organic traffic to generate sales. However, as the industry has become more competitive, paid advertising has become an increasingly important tool for driving traffic to affiliate sites. 
Paid ads can help to build brand awareness and reach new customers who may not be familiar with your site. In addition, paid advertising can be highly targeted, allowing you to promote your site to a specific audience. When used effectively, paid advertising can be a powerful way to drive traffic to your affiliate site and generate sales.
Consider using an advertising platform like Facebook to drive traffic to a landing page that discusses the features and benefits of whichever offer you’re promoting.

8. Make sure your site is easy to use
Any affiliate marketing site worth its salt needs to be easy to use, both for the marketers promoting the site and for the customers who will ultimately make purchases. 
A confusing or difficult-to-navigate site is likely to discourage potential customers, while a well-designed site will make it easy for them to find what they're looking for and complete their purchase. 
For affiliates, a user-friendly site is essential in order to maximize conversions and earnings. By ensuring that your site is easy to use, you'll be able to keep visitors happy and attract more customers, leading to increased sales and profits.

9. Make sure your site is fast
If you're planning on building an affiliate website, another important thing to consider is site speed. With page speed now a ranking factor, it’s more important than ever to have a fast-loading website.
Your site's load time will also have a direct impact on your conversion rate, and if your site is slow, potential customers are likely to click away before they even have a chance to see what you have to offer. 
There are a number of ways to improve your site's speed, including optimizing your images, using a content delivery network, minifying your files, etc. By taking the time to ensure that your site is fast and responsive, you'll be in a better position to convert visitors into customers.

10. Stay up to date with the latest affiliate marketing trends
When it comes to affiliate marketing, it's important to stay up-to-date with the latest trends. This can be a challenge, as the industry is constantly changing. However, there are a few simple ways to keep up with the latest trends. First, visit websites like Search Engine Journal or Search Engine Land on a daily basis to see if there are any important developments in the industry.
Things like Google’s recent algorithm updates, such as the March 2022 update aimed at product reviews, are good to be aware of.
If you want to take it a step further, consider attending affiliate marketing conferences. These events are a great way to network with other affiliate marketers and learn about new strategies and techniques. 
Finally, make use of social media. Platforms such as Twitter and LinkedIn are a great way to stay up-to-date with the latest affiliate marketing news. By following these simple tips, you can ensure that your affiliate marketing efforts are as effective as possible.

11. Diversify your income streams
It's important to diversify your income streams regardless of the type of business you’re in.
One way to diversify your income streams is to implement different monetization methods. This includes things like affiliate marketing, AdSense, sponsorships, your own products, etc. This way, if one monetization method drops in performance you'll still have others that are bringing in money. 


By diversifying your income streams, you'll be able to reduce your risk and increase your chances of success.

12. Build real relationships with others in the industry
When building an affiliate site, it's important to build real relationships with others in the industry. These relationships can provide valuable information and insight into the inner workings of the industry, which can be helpful in developing your site. 
In addition, these relationships can also lead to opportunities for joint ventures or other business arrangements. While it's important to maintain a professional relationship with industry contacts, it's also important to remember that these relationships should be built on trust and mutual respect. 


By taking the time to build strong relationships with others in the industry, you'll be better positioned to succeed in the affiliate marketing space.

13. Have realistic expectations
When you're first starting out with affiliate marketing, it's easy to get caught up in the hype and think that you're going to become a millionaire overnight. However, it's important to have realistic expectations about what you can achieve with your site. 
While it is possible to make a significant income from affiliate marketing, it takes time and hard work to build up a successful site. Most successful affiliate marketers start off by making a few dollars a day and gradually increase their earnings as they add more content and attract more visitors. 
If you're patient and willing to put in the work, you can achieve great things with your affiliate site. But if you're expecting to get rich quickly, you're likely to be disappointed.

What are the benefits of affiliate marketing?
Affiliate marketing has been around since the earliest days of online marketing, and it's still one of the most effective ways to earn a living online. As an affiliate, you have the potential to earn commissions on every sale you refer, and some programs even offer lifetime cookies, meaning you could continue to earn commissions for years to come.
This can be an excellent way to supplement your income or even become fully self-sufficient. Additionally, there are a number of other benefits associated with affiliate marketing, such as:


 	Very low start-up costs.
 	You can work from anywhere in the world.
 	It's a relatively passive form of income.
 	Commissions can be very high in certain niches.
 	Successful affiliate sites can exit at a high multiple

If you're looking for a way to make money online, affiliate marketing is definitely worth considering.

How do you find products to promote on your affiliate site?
If you're running an affiliate site, one of the most important decisions you'll make is what products to promote. There are a few different factors to consider when making this decision. 
First, think about your audience and what kinds of products they would be interested in. If you have a cooking-related affiliate site, for example, promoting kitchen appliances would make sense. Once you've narrowed down your options based on your audience's interests, take a look at the individual products themselves. 
Choose products that are high quality and likely to be popular with your audience. 
Amazon is a great place to start as a new affiliate since you can promote basically anything that Amazon sells and earn a commission. However, their commission rates are fairly low so it’s in your best interest to look to higher commission rate affiliate programs once your site starts getting traction.
Also, make sure to read through the terms of service for each affiliate program to make sure you're comfortable promoting the products. By taking the time to carefully select the right products to promote, you can ensure that your affiliate site is successful.

Is affiliate marketing saturated?
Some people believe that the affiliate marketing industry is becoming saturated. With so many people promoting similar products, they argue, it is becoming increasingly difficult to stand out from the crowd. 
While it is true that the affiliate marketing landscape is evolving, there is still ample opportunity for those who are willing to put in the work. By finding a niche market and developing high-quality content and beneficial partnerships, it is still possible to be successful as an affiliate marketer.

Conclusion
Affiliate marketing is a great way to make money online. While there are many ways to succeed as an affiliate marketer, there are also many ways to fail. In order to build a successful affiliate site in 2023, you need to focus on providing valuable content and building relationships with your audience. You also need to stay up-to-date on the latest trends in affiliate marketing so that you can continue to grow your business.
Hopefully, these tips have been helpful. Be sure to take action and implement them as you build out your affiliate site in 2023 and beyond.",4/27/2022,https://redtrack.io/blog/13-tips-for-building-an-affiliate-site/,affiliate marketing
9369,What is privacy-friendly tracking & analytics in advertising?,"For every business owner or marketer, it had to be clear by now that we stepped into a highly privacy-regulated world. 

Those changes touch marketing and analytics tremendously. Therefore, we have to figure out how to perform our job taking into consideration privacy regulations and the way we handle personal data for marketing purposes. 

In this article, we will be unfolding: 

 	what is privacy-friendly tracking &amp; analytics
 	how to find a solution that is compliant with all the regulations
 	what are the benefits of relying on privacy alternatives besides compliance with regulations
 	how to implement privacy-friendly tracking to be sure that no billion-dollar fines await your business



Why you should invest in privacy-friendly measurement now 
Control over the data flow has become one of the most important subjects of the 2020s. We entered a world where we realized how much personal data leaks to the world wide web and how it can damage your privacy &amp; security at times. 

It’s important for both: business owners and individuals. 

To ensure that both parties are able to have their freedoms and also perform their job, privacy regulations stepped in. And even though I believe there has not been a perfect middle ground yet, this train is moving towards a safe &amp; privacy-compliant future. 

Here are some of the acts that ensure that your personal data stays personal, as well as acts that regulate how we advertisers and marketers should be doing our job: 

 	GDPR (Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation);
 	CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act);
 	LGPD (Brazil’s General Personal Data Protection Law).

&nbsp;
What does privacy-friendly mean in the advertising industry? 
The main objective of all those restrictions is to keep personal data private and out of use for corporations.

You should know here about two notions: personal data and PII (personally identifiable information). 

There is not much difference between those terms, but personal data is broader and more of a ""legal"" notion used in regulatory acts meaning any sort of data about living creatures.
PII is the sort of data that can be linked and connected to a very specific human being.
When we talk about privacy-friendly advertising &amp; marketing, we mean that businesses do not own, store or use personal or PII data in order to achieve their goals. 
But how do business owners get access to this data? 
Cookies' role in privacy issues
Here we can NOT skip the talk about cookies as they (almost) solely are responsible for marketing being not compliant with all those regulations in 2022. 

We have an amazing video describing how cookies work and how they affect privacy, so check it out if you wanna understand this subject better. 

However, cookies store in their bodies this precious personal or PII data that should not be accessed so easily. Therefore, we see all those acts “restricting” the influence of cookies and the requirement to place those huge consent banners on the websites. And this marks the cookieless era — aka the time when rules of the game for advertisers change. However, it's not cookieless per se, it's about the death of third-party cookies and exchange for a ""healthier"" version — first-party cookies.  
How industry changed with the arrival of privacy regulations
Not only the fear of huge fines should be bothering you in the times of privacy-regulated marketing.

In fact, it's not us mere advertisers that have to follow regulations in the first place, it's big advertising networks and channels whose primary revenue was relying on you investing in paid ads through them: Apple, Facebook, Google, etc.

These are the changes with those giants in the past 2 years:

 	Apple introduced an ATT prompt requiring people to consent to in-app tracking
 	Facebook introduced Facebook Conversion API as a first-party data alternative since Apple ATT prompt limited the data flow from iOS devices
 	Google announced a privacy-oriented initiative called ""Google Privacy Sandbox"" which targets to change the whole ecosystem towards the extinction of third-party cookies and prioritization of personal data importance.

Those changes influenced the performance you get through your day-to-day advertising strategies, and influenced the results that you have when spending the exact same budget on ads. Therefore, privacy regulations are not harmful for advertising only because of the threat of law suits, but rather it's a complex problem for the whole industry.

Therefore, privacy-friendly advertising means that you follow everything prescribed by regulatory acts and do not use personal data from cookies without the consent of users. 
Privacy-friendly tracking &amp; analytics is built on first-party data which is being obtained directly, with users’ consent. 
Let’s go over the prerequisites for privacy-friendly tracking &amp; analytics
If you don’t wanna get impossible fines for breaking the “privacy” rules, you have to invest in privacy-friendly analytics. Not only it is a legal way to do business, but it also ensures a better performance. 

Here is the list of qualities that will help you identify that you are tracking marketing performance in a privacy-compliant manner:
1. Usage of first-party data through first-party cookies
When looking for the solution for tracking &amp; analytics, be sure to see that it uses first-party data and does not rely on third-party cookies. Usage of third-party cookies is a sure way to “get caught” by regulations like GDPR. 

When we say using first-party cookies, it means that all the data is stored on your website and accessed via secure tracking technologies through API integrations directly from your website. The data is not openly stored or shared in any other way.
2. Your solution does not openly store PII data and uses data hashing
PII (personally identifiable information) should not be openly stored when it comes to privacy-compliant solutions. For example, in the case of RedTrack (an all-in-one marketing analytics solution), we hash the PII data on the flow.
To hash personal data means to substitute part of the symbols with the code and make personal data non-human-readable.
So RedTrack ""codes"" part of the PII data (like email, phone number, etc.) while sending it to the RedTrack's system, and our platform does not receive any human-readable personal data.
3. You are in control over the exchange of the data between systems 
When choosing your privacy-compliant solution, you have to be sure that it does not exchange any of the data it receives with other companies and that you are the only full owner of the data. You are the only person who can initiate the exchange and stop it at any time.

For example, any of the API integrations you connect to your stack (whether it's Facebook, Google or affiliate network), you are in control of this integration and how the data is being processed and you can disconnect those tools at any time.
4. You have access to data logs 
One of the sure methods to check your solution for the privacy compliance is access to data logs. It's a special tab in your tracking software that gives you a glance at all the conversions, clicks, and other pieces of data in one place.

Here's an example of conversion logs in RedTrack's platform.



But data logs are not only a great way to distinguish a privacy-compliant tracking tool. It's also a handy way to control your performance and test if everything is correctly set up. Through data logs, you can access every single conversion or click that happened to your ads, which gives you total control over your performance.
5. You can delete or request the removal of data at any time
And lastly, you should be able to delete or request to delete any of the personal data at any time with your solution. Better to find out the opportunity to do so in advance.
A privacy-compliant marketing analytics solution
One of the biggest missions that our team at RedTrack had is to build a future-proof tool that would be acting like a lifeline for marketers at times of privacy turbulence.

Catching the trend of ""cookieless"" future back in 2017 we started building what RedTrack is now — a privacy-compliant and secure solution for marketing analytics.
Now RedTrack can perform the following activities without any breach of data compliance:

 	Ad tracking: track the performance of all PPC (paid ads) campaigns you run and analyze it in-depth;
 	Conversion attribution: find out which channel contributes more towards the expected result;
 	Marketing automation: find out best-performing offers or creatives and automatically send traffic there;
 	Partnership Portal: launch your affiliate program or referral program, also manage influencer marketing.

At RedTrack we make sure that all the data is stored in first-party cookies and is not passed to any third-party systems. You are the only data owner and you have full control over all the data that RedTrack collects for you: you can request to delete it at any time.

All of the integrations that we run with RedTrack (like Facebook Conversion API or Google API) have an in-built hashing process when the information gets into a non-human-readable form before it reaches RedTrack.

Also, RedTrack hides the last 3 digits of all the API addresses while processing and before sending it to the database.

Besides all the obvious compliance benefits, RedTrack gives you an opportunity to optimize your advertising according to the accurate conversion data that you track and get better performance results.

Make every single dollar invested in marketing work for you, not against you.

9388,Guide To Using LinkedIn For B2B Sales: 7 Tips,"Although you might not have considered it before, LinkedIn is a powerhouse for B2B marketing and generating sales leads. 

However, if you’ve never used LinkedIn to make sales before, it can feel like a daunting and time-consuming prospect.

But as the platform now boasts almost 740 million members, 40% of which access it on a daily basis, this is a sales opportunity you can’t afford to miss! 

Not to mention it was built for the sole purpose of business networking, which means it works exceptionally well for B2B lead generation.

So if you’re looking for new ways to boost sales this year, this guide can help. Here are our top tips and advice for making B2B sales through LinkedIn.
1. Make sure you’ve got a great LinkedIn profile 
In order to generate B2B sales leads through LinkedIn, you first need to start off with the basics - creating a great LinkedIn profile. This will be the first thing that any potential new lead or connection will see; therefore, it needs to be good. 

This goes for you as an individual and your company page too. 

The good news is there are several things you can do to instantly boost your LinkedIn profile, and these include: 

 	Choosing a professional, clear, and well-lit profile photo 
 	The same applies to background photos - these must be professional and high resolution 
 	Creating an attention-grabbing headline - a good formula is {job title} helping X do Y
 	Crafting an about section that clearly explains who you are, what problems you solve, and any unique selling points
 	Highlighting your location, achievements (yours or the company’s), and any work-related hobbies on your profile
 	Offering a full work and education history or, in the case of your company, giving some insight into how the company came to be

Examples of LinkedIn profiles to get inspired from:
1. Dave Gerhardt (marketing expert)
You can notice that Dave uses the banner space to directly advertise the community he created. The banner instantly draws your attention as visual information is perceived much faster than simple text.

In the profile description, you can find all the prominent information and achievements in the description field: current occupation, former job &amp; other activities (like publishing a book).


2. Nadja Komnenic (Sales expert)
Nadja uses banner space to air her (or her company's) positioning and opinion. Through banner, we can directly access what kind of content you will be able to find.

Also, you can find how much growth her company achieved (which is direct evidence of experience) and her other activities like public speaking &amp; YouTube hosting (which build trust).

3. Lisa Dziuba (marketing expert)
Again the experience is proven in numbers (ARR growth). The former experience showed, as well as the title ""Forbes 30 under 30"".


2. Build a strong network for B2B sales 
Once you’ve perfected your profile, you need to work on building a strong network. This means connecting with professionals in your industry or in your target industry, as well as like-minded businesses and providers. 

Now, don’t just go on a connecting spree and request every person that comes up, as this can look unprofessional, spammy and it won’t do you any favors down the line. 

Start small by putting the time and effort into finding the right connections. It is estimated that to start seeing results, you need to connect with at least 200 people in your target industry. So build this up gradually so you can create an engaged and relevant following. 

You can find the best connections on LinkedIn by searching relevant hashtags, commenting on relevant posts, and perhaps even asking for advice, or engaging with others’ content. You can also share industry insights on your own page to see who engages with you. 

These steps will help you to build a strong and relevant following, building your reputation and showing you to be a more trustworthy source. 
3. Create quality content for your target audience
Content marketing is an important technique for generating sales leads, and this still applies to LinkedIn. You need to share content about topics that your target audience is interested in. 
Recommendations for your quality content:

 	Relevant industry news 
 	Interesting &amp; useful insights from your personal experience
 	Infographics 
 	Images 
 	Adverts 
 	Video content 

Whatever you choose to share, it is advised that you share a variety of content for the best results, just make sure that it is always relevant, eye-catching, engaging, and useful to your target audience. 

You can also add relevant hashtags to help attract the right people to your content. 

Be sure to reply to others or like their comments and engage with anyone interested in your content. 

This can help to nurture relationships and generate leads that could later turn into sales. You can also use your content to steer them towards your business page or website.
4. Join relevant LinkedIn groups 
Another great way to build connections and find prospective leads is by joining niche LinkedIn groups related to your industry. You can leverage these groups, looking for those posting about their problems to which you can offer a solution.  

You can also take part in relevant discussions, contributing as much as you can and getting your name and brand out there in a positive way. 

This also affords you another opportunity to share your content if you have any useful blogs, articles, stories, etc., that you think would be relevant and genuinely helpful to those in the group. 
5. Run prospective sales searches
A great way to build your network and find prospective customers is to make the most of the search functionality on LinkedIn. 

This enables you to filter your criteria in a very specific way so you can be proactive and targeted in your approach. For example, you can search by location, industry, job title, and more! 

From this, you can generate a list of prospects, going onto their profile and seeing if their contact information has been made available. 
6. Do thorough research 
Armed with your list, you can begin to do even more research into your prospects, and this will be the key to your success. 

You are aiming to understand their individual buying triggers if they are the decision-maker and what the key challenges that their business is facing. 

This way, when you do reach out to them, you can use this information to give them a very targeted and relevant pitch and boost your chances of making a B2B sale.   

&nbsp;
7. Utilise the LinkedIn Social Selling Index (SSI)
Finally, LinkedIn offers a feature called Social Selling Index (SSI) and this tool measures how effective you are at:

 	Establishing your brand 
 	Finding the right prospective B2B customers
 	Engaging with insights 
 	Building relationships with your network and prospectives 

Your Social Selling Index is updated on a daily basis, and you can access the dashboard at any time for insights. Armed with these insights you’ll know which areas you need to improve on and which to focus on during the sales cycle. 

This way, you can proactively make changes and ensure you’re doing everything you can to boost B2B sales.

9392,Ultimate eCommerce conversion tracking checklist 2023: How to make data-based marketing decisions,"Day by day eCommerce becomes a more competitive field. Success in the “populated” business niche comes with constant adaptation and invention, especially for marketing necessities.
However, in order to adapt and create new strategies you need to measure the influence of every single initiative you run for eCom. 
How do you do that in 2023? 


Well, that’s a great question that I would like to answer in this blog post: how to perform accurate conversion tracking and measure the results of all of your marketing campaigns in 2023. 

In this blog post you will find info about: 


 	Fundamental transformations in performance marketing for eCommerce 
 	Measurement of Facebook Ads 
 	Consolidation of the data from FB Ads, as well as other paid &amp; non-paid channels 
 	And how to achieve an accurate data transmission between your eCom platform (like Shopify), marketing channels, and analytics solution
 	How to switch your decision-making to a data-based approach 


Before proceeding with the article, check our newest eCommerce series — Figure{It}Out!



What changes in eCommerce marketing performance in 2023? 
Let’s start with understanding why we have to switch things around in order to achieve accurate performance tracking &amp; precise decision-making in eCommerce marketing.

1. The universal shift towards a privacy-oriented industry
Firstly and most importantly, we have to remember that it’s not just about eCommerce, but it’s a global shift towards a privacy-regulated future where the personal data of the users is treated in a secure way. We have a couple of acts (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) influencing the regular work of advertising channels (like Facebook, Google, TikTok, etc.) as well as the way we as business owners and marketers should treat the data collected on the website.
This shift influences marketers on every single level: from fear of getting fines for not complying with laws to a drop in the performance of advertising channels (because of the loss of access to conversion data.
Additional reading: What is privacy-friendly tracking &amp; analytics?
2. Facebook Ads is not as easy for eCommerce as before

Now let’s review the most popular advertising channels for any eCom player — Facebook Ads.
What used to be easy-peasy lemon-squeezy even for newbie marketers now gets more confusing. Now Facebook requires not only a better understanding of the process but also third-party tools to at least keep the performance stable. Why does that happen?
Privacy regulations mentioned above made Apple introduce its ATT prompts in iOS 14 and later devices. Facebook also had to start moving towards a more privacy-friendly approach (meaning elimination of third-party cookies and disruption of FB pixel).

These 2 reasons combined caused a huge conversion data loss that was used in algorithms to ensure that you have a very smart targeting &amp; optimization of your campaigns.
So, your Facebook machine learning does not receive enough data now to make proper optimization and that’s exactly why you need a third-party tracking &amp; analytics tool to integrate Facebook with your eCommerce platform and consolidate data accordingly.
3. You kinda have to move beyond FB Ads
Because of increasing competition and a drop in the performance of FB Ads, you should consider moving beyond Facebook Ads. Whether it’s including other paid channels or experimenting with good old email / SMS marketing. Another great thing to implement is influencer campaigns.
But again, how do you measure and evaluate all of those efforts and make decisions not like ‘flipping a coin”?
Let’s find out.
How to track ALL conversions in eCommerce 
Now let’s find out how to navigate our way through conversion tracking in the times of privacy updates, dropped Facebook performance, inaccurate FB reports, and a multitude of marketing channels. 

1. Let’s start with identifying target conversion events 
Conversion events are pretty conventional for eCommerce, but it’s good to set this part straight before you start your conversion tracking journey.
The common events would be: 


 	view content
 	add-to-cart
 	abandoned cart
 	purchase
 	recurring purchase

Be sure to adapt events towards your brand and your strategy, later it will allow you to have more flexibility with tracking. 

2. Create a structure for your tracking parameters (UTMs)
Now it’s time to understand what you wanna capture from your advertising channels: set tracking parameters. Or as Google names them — UTMs. 


Now parameters are super important in conversion tracking as they are basically recording all the data pieces from different levels of your advertising campaigns.

Through tracking parameters you can identify: 

 	Which channel brought conversion
 	Which campaign resulted towards success
 	Which adset / ad group influenced conversions 
 	Which creatives performs better &amp; other cool stuff

Consider using these tracking parameters in eCommerce: 


 	source
 	medium
 	campaign
 	content
 	keyword &amp; others

3. Choose your instrument to perform conversion tracking
Now it’s time to settle on a tool that will become your conversion tracking partner. The first assumption you might have is Google Analytics. It’s a great beginner to medium level tool that allows performing essential analytics, however, GA also comes with a few restrictions.
With Google Analytics for performance measurement: 

1) You can’t access the data about the costs of the campaigns or particular ads.
The absence of cost data can be crucial for prompt reaction towards the performance of your campaigns. Since the “money” variable is one of the most important in a marketing job, it’s crucial to track these metrics and react accordingly.
For example, you won’t be able to measure the cost of each add-to-cart. 
2) Poor offline event tracking
If you wanna measure events that happen on your website or platform (like upsell, additional purchase, etc.) it’s good to have offline conversion tracking. Google Analytics is not an appropriate tool for that.  
3) GA uses aggregated data
Due to the very same privacy issues, Google Analytics uses aggregated data for analytics which can decrease the effectiveness of your decisions based on data. I recommend choosing tools that operate with raw data for advertising by collecting everything independently.
How to choose a tool for conversion tracking in eCommerce
Therefore, I suggest you try using alternative tracking &amp; analytics tools that will answer a few criteria: 


 	Use ONLY first-party data to comply with all privacy regulations 
 	Has data cost control (meaning you will receive real-time costs of your advertising campaigns) 
 	Has an integration with eCommerce platforms to allow data consolidation &amp; matching 
 	Has API integrations with advertising channels you use (like Facebook Conversion API, Google API, TikTok API, etc. 
 	If you invest in influencer marketing, it will be very nice to have a “promo code tracking” feature to measure performance not only through links but through promo codes automatically.

4. Add tracking scripts to your shop
When the tool for tracking &amp; analytics has been chosen, it’s time to take probably the most precious element from it — your tracking script/scripts.
This piece of code will be helping record all of the tracking parameters we decided to implement in our strategy.
Please, pay close attention to the fact that your tool has an integration with an eCommerce platform (like Shopify or WooCommerce), it will ensure you can implement the tracking script easily.
For example, in the case of RedTrack, we have a feature called a Universal tracking script.
You can automatically generate it when choosing all the required settings of your choice, then you can place it on your website. The universal script will be ensuring that conversions or other target events will be taken care of from all of your marketing &amp; advertising channels. 
Besides, RedTrack has a Shopify Private App for seamless integration and a WooCommerce conversion tracking plugin, so the integration prerequisite is covered!


5. Generate tracking parameters
Then proceed to generate tracking parameters through your analytics tool or manually, follow the structure you already created in steps 1 and 2.


6. Add tracking parameters to all campaigns  
Now it’s time to add those tracking parameters to all of your active campaigns. Tracking parameters will be transmitting required data from ads / adsets or campaigns to your analytics tool, from where you can access accurate performance reports and make further decisions. 
Make sure to implement tracking parameters for organic social channels (like a link to your website on social networks), for all the email campaigns, and for all your third-party tools (like social commerce ones).
If you leave some of the channels without tracking parameters, you might have some spare clicks &amp; conversions coming from unknown sources or simply being recorded as organic, which is not good for decision-making in a data-based approach. 

7. And lastly, launch, test, create and invent 
When you went through these conversion tracking steps, you will find access to accurate reports and peace of mind.
You will know exactly which campaign wins, which campaign should be stopped, which channels require better optimization and the cost behind each advertising initiative.

Accurate reports are your free pass towards transparent growth and scaling. It also allows you to be backed by data every time you make a marketing decision.

Even though marketing intuition is amazing, performance marketing is all about performance. And we can measure this performance with the use of tools like RedTrack.

9461,How to boost sales with social commerce,"We as marketers understand how quickly the industry changes and that we need to adjust and find out how we can maintain our performance in the new reality. Here comes social commerce that allows maintaining a connection with customers in the e-commerce niche. Social or conversational commerce is a new standard for a e-commerce brand so in this article we would like to educate you on steps you can take to introduce it to your business. 

In this article we will discuss:

 	What is a social commerce 
 	Challenges in e-commerce 
 	How to implement social commerce
 	Post-Checkout experience in e-commerce
 	Future of Social commerce
 	Must-have tools for e-commerce

This article is based on the conversation with our special guest Shuvo Rahman, Founder &amp; CEO of MyAlice.We discussed challenges in e-commerce today and how communication with our customers directly affects sales. 
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
What is social-commerce 
Social commerce is the process of selling your products or services using social media channels to communicate with your customers directly to provide them with the best customer experience.
The pandemic boosted changes in the e-commerce industry drastically. The 10-year growth of the industry took only 3 months, and even giant like Shopify has grown more than 2 times in a few years. 

We noticed that there are more and more e-commerce stores and more new businesses entering the D2C (Direct-to-consumer) segment.

These businesses need to find a way to provide exceptional customer service. They become available on social media, which their customers use the most. But how do they find the optimal way for communication? How do they introduce real-life experience in the e-commerce world?
Social commerce has a potential to do so by allowing customers to directly chat and talk to your business through they favorite social channels. You can communicate with customer in the place that is convenient for them, use their language, therefore, increase your revenue through a better customer experience. 
And that’s where social commerce becomes so handy. Because actually selling through those social channels can be way easier than investing in other marketing &amp; advertising channels. 
How did iOS 14 affect e-commerce? 
One of the biggest challenges of the last year in e-commerce is IOS 14. It negatively affected the tracking &amp; analytics of the marketing performance of e-stores. 

Shuvo shares that the IOS ATT prompt became the biggest challenge for marketers regardless of demographics, regions, or countries. However, IOS 14 became a real struggle mostly for big e-commerce and e-commerce enterprises.
RedTrack is solving the problem of inaccurate tracking after iOS 14 by providing reliable first-party data technologies that will work even at the time of the cookieless future.

With RedTrack you can track 100% of your conversions and manage the conversion data between marketing channels and your e-commerce platform. 
While giants of e-commerce face the reality of IOS 14 implementation, small and growing stores have other challenges. They sell mostly on social media, launch marketing campaigns on socials, and keep the inventory on a separate platform. The main struggle is that you need to use multiple software and switch between the channels to maintain communication with a customer if you sell with socials. Social commerce tools like MyAlice can solve this issue and simplify the journey for your e-commerce business. 
How to implement social commerce
If you wanna win the competition, you should start thinking of implementing social commerce in your e-commerce business. But where do you start? Let's explore three simple steps to start your social &amp; conversationa journey.
Step 1: Find your social channels 
In order not to miss important data you need to understand which social media is more popular among your customer segment and monitor them for better performance. Commonly used social media really depends on the location of your customers. So be sure to identify those valuable channels that will be a direct bridge to your target audience. 
Step 2: Create a strategy
How are you gonna communicate with these customers? What's the best way to communicate with people through these particular socials?

Once you figure out the channels you'll have to come up with a strategy to maintain a conversation with the customers. 
Just knowing that your customers are available on this social media more often doesn't guarantee success. You might be not the only business that chooses social commerce.
 After analysis, you will understand when it is the best time to interact with your audience and what content they want to see from you on a chosen channel.
Step 3: Maintain the conversation with your customers 
You can use the help of customer care agents, robots, and AI, or you can do a hybrid approach and use all of them. You’ll also need to think about the tools that you will use to serve your customers. Choose tools that will help you monitor all the communication with a customer and analyze their steps toward a purchase.

MyAlice is one of the tools that will help you take the communication from each of your social channels to a single platform for it to be easier to keep track of everything.
Post-Checkout experience in e-commerce with social commerce
Post-checkout experience in e-commerce is staying in touch with your customers even after they made a purchase.
Post-purchase interaction is underestimated, although it is easier to easier to upsell than pursue a new customer. You already understand your customer's needs which makes it easier to give them the best offer.

It is valuable to track every step that led to a purchase. It is important to track not only the last conversions but also all the upsells and additional sales, which is called the Post-Checkout experience in e-commerce.

People spend a lot of time on social media and messengers chatting with their family and friends. So, it would make sense to bring e-commerce to a place where your customers spend most of their time. Instead of a familiar interaction via email or SMS, try using the most used social channels among your customers. 

Social commerce in the post-checkout experience can drive your sales once you learn when and where it is better to communicate with your customers. The most effective channel will vary for different customer segments. It really depends on the location, and which channel to use for social commerce. 

Also, do not forget that there are tools that will let you manage communication with your customers and track the conversions. Such tools help you provide an outstanding customer experience and track attributions. They give you a better understanding of your audience and where you need to pay more attention to boost your sales.
Future of Social commerce
The experience that customers get in online stores is very different from what they experience in real life because of the lack of personalization in e-commerce. 

You can provide your customers with a personalized experience by keeping the data in one place, which will help you understand customers better. It is like in real life when they enter a store, you see your customer and have a real conversation to understand their preferences.

AI approach is becoming the future of social commerce because it is the best way to process a big amount of data. However, machines will never be able to substitute for human creativity. Automation will complement people's work social commerce to make it more personal.
Must-have tools for e-commerce business 
MyAlice is a unified inbox that connects all social and messaging channels with your e-commerce store. With MyAlice you will be able to keep all conversations and customer tickets from all social channels in one place in order to provide a better customer experience on the web. 

Even though RedTrack and MyAlice have different purposes, we have one thing in common - connecting all the social channels in one place. While MyAlice helps to maintain a conversation with the customers to know them better, RedTrack connects all the marketing channels, where you could see the performance of your marketing campaigns and track all the conversions.

9476,What is server-side advertising tracking and why you should implement it?,"Have you heard about GDPR, CCPA, CCPR, ATT prompt, Facebook Conversion API things, Google Privacy Sandbox? 

It’s all about the same thing — a cookieless future or a future without third-party cookies. S2S tracking is one of the methods that work even during times like that. 

Server-side tracking gradually replaces the pixel that misfures. But how does it actually work and what are the benefits for advertisers?

Let’s explore in this article:

 	Background of cookieless updates 
 	What is S2S (server-side) tracking 
 	Pixel tracking method VS server-side tracking 
 	Why pixel is outdated
 	Server-side tracking as a new standard 
 	Why use RedTrack as a solution for server-side tracking? 



The importance of cookieless updates 
Understanding the urgency and ultimate importance of cookieless updates is crucial when introducing yourself to the topic of server-side tracking. 
Privacy matters have been around for a while and third-party cookies gained a really bad reputation. 

What we have to understand as marketers, is that pixels are not gonna work in the nearest future. And even if they continue functioning technically, it will not show you the accuracy behind your performance because of all of the privacy updates happening on the market. 
Starting with GDPR, and CCPA and finishing with updates from companies like Facebook (introduction of Facebook Conversion API) and Google (introduction of Google Privacy Sandbox).

S2S tracking is the only way now to track your clicks&amp; conversions accurately and align marketing between channels (imagine you have multiple marketing channels, platforms, and networks you are working with, that means you need to establish data flow between all of them and S2S will allow you to do that. 
What is S2S (server-side) tracking? 
Server-side tracking (S2S) is a privacy-friendly and secure way to track your conversions.

In S2S tracking, when a user clicks on a tracking link or generates an ad impression, a unique identifier (unique ID) is generated and stored. Later, when the conversion happens, the same unique ID is being pulled out to match the initial click with the latter conversion. That’s how tracking solutions know that it was that particular user making a conversions without breaching any privacy rules.



In order to get this job done, you need an ad tracking solution to perform server-side tracking. Otherwise, you will spend a lot of time &amp; financial resources developing such solutions. When investing in a privacy-friendly solution, you get the S2S tracking method by default and get reliable marketing data for further analysis.

The unique ID also comes with some data about the user. Unique user information such as browser, country, operating system, internet service provider, time and date at which the information was sent, etc. can be understood simply based on the click ID alone.

When the conversion happens, the affiliate networks (or other marketing channels) send back the value along with the unique ID (that’s also why this method being called postback). 

Server-to-server conversion tracking will help you to know exactly when and where and at what time the conversion was generated. This helps to make the optimization process quick and easy when compared to other forms of the campaign.

Server-side tracking VS pixel tracking 
Pixel tracking is also known as the cookie-based tracking method. When going for such an option, you simply install a piece of HTML code on your website. Therefore, all the data is being stored not on the server-side, but on the client-side.

This is exactly what makes this tracking method less accurate.

Pixel can easily be blocked by ad blockers and users may simply delete cookies (which will affect your statistics). Therefore, the performance reported by pixels is not precise. 
Why pixel is an outdated tracking method 
As the pixel is a typical representation of “cookies times”, the performance of pixels is severely affected by all the changes from Apple (ATT prompt), Facebook, Google, etc. 

All of the platforms are slowly going towards server-side integrations to ensure that you as marketers can have access to an accurate performance report &amp; comply with privacy regulations. Therefore, pixels just become crumbles of cookies from the past that can not provide you with performance data like they used to even though technically these codes still function. 
Server-side tracking as a new golden standard for marketers 
Marketers turn to server-side tracking as a way to track marketing channels, have access to performance data, and analyze and optimize marketing activities towards better and more effective results. 

Your unique ID generated during a server-side tracking will give you the data about the date &amp; time of the conversion, as well as some other important variables like OS, browser, location, etc.

This data will allow you to optimize your marketing for better results. 

Server-side tracking also opens the opportunity to integrate all of your marketing channels through a trusted ad tracking software and establish the data exchange between systems. Your affiliate networks will receive data from all the marketing channels, your ad channels (Facebook, Google, Taboola, TikTok, Bing) will be fed with data for algorithms optimization, and your ad tracking system will have a joint report from all the channels to give you an overview of your marketing efforts and results. 
RedTrack as a tool for server-side conversion tracking 
If you are looking for a trusted marketing analytics tool to perform s2s tracking, you should consider turning to RedTrack for several reasons: 

 	RedTrack has integration with 200+ channels: affiliate networks, ad channels, and e-commerce platforms. You will find built-in templated from all the needed platforms to easily start analyzing performance. 
 	By default, you get server-side tracking with all the important marketing channels (Facebook, Google, TikTok, Bing, ClickBank, etc.) 
 	RedTrack is an unbiased source of marketing data that shows you your performance from different angles in a single report.

Like the GDPR, the CPRA was created to set standards for the United States, and avoid misunderstanding and misuse of consumers' personal data. Moreover, even though the CPRA won’t be enforceable until the beginning of 2023, any type of data collected after January 1st, 2022, is subject to the CPRA. 

There are many things to learn about the CPRA, and we have much more to tell you. So don’t go anywhere because, in this article, we will intensely discuss the CPRA. 
How to prepare your business for the CPRA 
CPRA compliance
Companies that are operating in California or  collect personal information from California residents, regardless if it’s for marketing purposes or not, are subject to CPRA if it: 

 	Manages to have a revenue higher than $25 million annually 
 	Manages to make more than 50% of revenue from selling and sharing personal information of California residents 
 	Buys, shares, and sells the personal information of more than 100,000 Californian households 

A significant change that has been made from the CCPA to the CPRA is to remove the requirement of using personal information only for marketing purposes. So now, even if the company isn’t profiting from consumers’ personal information, you are still required to comply with the law. 

CPRA compliance is quite interesting because if you are a small or medium-sized business, you may not have to comply with the CPRA but rather with the CCPA. Initially, you have to identify if your business should comply with the CCPA or the CPRA. Many think they’re both the same, but the truth is that they have some key differences. Comparatively, the CPRA loosens many restrictions the CCPA has, whereas some small and mid-sized businesses don’t fall under the compliance of the CPRA. However, at the same time, it strengthens many weaknesses of the CCPA as well. 

Note: If you’re interested in learning about the CPRA, you can read more on Osano's website.  
What are the differences between the CCPA and CPRA? 
The CPRA is considered an amendment of the CCPA by offering a GDPR approach, expanding individual rights, and much more. Here are the two major differences between the two:

 	Complying with the CCPA means you buy, sell, or receive shares for business marketing purposes. It’s also applicable if you buy, sell, or receive shares from the personal information of around 50,000 consumers and households. However, the CPRA requires more than 100,000 consumers and households. 
 	Complying with the CCPA means you are receiving at least 50% of annual revenue from selling consumers' personal information. With the CPRA, it’s from selling and sharing personal information. It is necessary to have an SSL certificate when you share personal information with the website. So, it is important to buy SSL certificates from reputed SSL providers like ClickSSL that offer the same encryption level authenticated SSL certificates.

The CPRA also included the creation of the Californian Privacy Protection Agency (CaIPPA), a dedicated privacy agency that five board members govern. These members have to be experts in privacy, consumer rights, and technology. Otherwise, they aren’t able to qualify. Additionally, they can serve no more than eight years within the privacy agency. 
Amendments 
Following the CCPA, individuals can only request access to their personal data for one year from when it was stored and collected. However, with the CPRA, you have the right anytime you wish to do so. 

Moreover, when the CCPA defines “selling,” it doesn’t precisely mean sharing. On the other hand, the CPRA includes “Sell” and “Share.” Additionally, the CPRA clarifies the right to stop (opt-out) businesses from sharing and selling their personal information to other parties. 

Finally, let’s not forget that both the CCPA and CPRA allow companies to be sued. Consumers can do this should a company expose sensitive information without authority, and cause data breaches that reveal passwords and usernames. 
What’s new with the CPRA, and how does it impact your business? 
New amendments have been made both to the CPRA and the CCPA in order to include new rights that businesses are obliged to comply with. Why so? According to SalesForce, about 46% of consumers feel they don’t have enough control over their private data. Sadly, only 10% think they have enough control over their personal data. 

Nevertheless, businesses that violate these laws will face huge fines of thousands of dollars and be sued for intentional private data violations. 

Now, let’s clarify a few important things here. First, when you are a business, under the CPRA, you are obliged to explain why you are collecting personal information and who you are sharing the information with. However, under the CCPA, you have the right to ask why your personal data is being collected. Moreover, people have the right to inform businesses of inaccurate information or if any amendments need to be made. 

Under the CPRA, consumers have more rights. This includes gaining knowledge of where their information is being used, and how to correct inaccurate information that they may see. 

Here are a few things your business can apply to adapt to these regulations: 

 	Define the purpose of why you are collecting the data 
 	Apply security measures in order to protect personal information 
 	Show a list of entities data is being shared with and why your business is sharing it with them collecting personal information 
 	Provide all the sources of information your business is using and collecting 
 	Keep updating your privacy information and show that your business always complies with the latest laws. Don’t forget to deliver updates through email, website, phone, and social media. 
 	Implement procedures that ensure you are processing and reviewing data for authenticity. Additionally, add an “opt-out” feature so that users can stop sharing their personal information if they wish to do so. 

A new category of protected data 
The CPRA has introduced the idea of sensitive personal information (SPI). This forces businesses that collect this type of information to provide more robust data protection. The SPI includes the following type of personal information:

 	Health data
 	Genetic data
 	Religious data
 	Ethnic origin 
 	Geolocation
 	Data concerning a person’s sexual orientation
 	ID cards, driver’s licenses, Social Security numbers, and more 
 	Ethnic and racial origin 

The CPRA places restrictions on a new category of data. It also adds new requirements for companies who collect SPI, including updated purpose and disclosure, opt-out requirements, and more. 
Data minimization and storage limitations 
Businesses are required to minimize or limit the retention, use, and sharing of personal information whenever possible. Overall, the CPRA stops businesses from retaining personal information longer than required. Furthermore, companies must inform the CPRA about their retention periods for each personal data they collect. 

So, what do you have to do about this? First, your business should state how long it’ll retain personal data and if it’ll be longer than necessary. This should be noted in the company's policies, including data deletion, and ensure that all laws are followed. 
Retaliation isn’t allowed 
It’s important to know that the CPRA doesn’t accept discrimination against consumers who opt-out of their information. This includes the following: 

 	Denying the types of goods and services to the consumer
 	Providing a different level or quality of goods and services to the consumer 
 	Charging different prices for your goods or services, including discounts or any other benefits 
 	Going against a team member, a candidate that has applied to your company, or even an independent contractor for condemning opt-out rights 

Use privacy-friendly tools for your marketing
When you invest big budgets in marketing &amp; advertising, you have to make sure that your investments are actually paying off. To do that you need a marketing analytics platfrom that will be collecting data from all of your marketing channels and give you valuable reports to make further data-infromed decisions. 

RedTrack is your privacy-friendly solution (that complies with GDPR, CCPA, CCPR, etc.), but still provides results with analyzing your marketing efforts and showing you the real numbers about your performance. 



Consider using a consent management platform (CMP) 
CMPs are an excellent way of helping your business manage any company documents and user consent legally before data is collected, stored, or even shared. They ensure you remain compliant with privacy laws and even inform you whenever changes are made. Additionally, CMPs can manage requests you make for data information and monitor all third-party vendors. 

Here are some CMPs you can consider using to help you stay updated with privacy laws and manage data requests: 

 	OneTrust 
 	Quantcast 
 	TrustArc 
 	Cookiebot 
 	Crownpeak 

Wrapping it up
That’s all for this article. These are the new amendments that have been made to the CPRA. However, don’t think these will be the only ones ever made, the CPRA continuously changes! 

The overall aim of the CPRA is to ensure that consumers have sufficient control over their data and do not feel insecure about data breaches or losing control over their personal data. After all, the data belongs to consumers, and they can decide how their data is being used.

Wordans is a clothing eCommerce brand that focuses heavily on young demographics. They partnered with micro TikTok creators to create inspirational and lighthearted videos, generating almost 120k views and 5k likes.
Why We Love This Ad

 	TikTok wants to be inspired. You can’t go wrong with authentic before &amp; afters or funny transformations. 
 	That doesn’t just go for your ads: test it in your organic content.
 	You run a campaign once, but you keep seeing results. If TikTok remembers you, viewers will drive more branded searches and traffic in the months to come.

How to Evaluate Your TikTok Ads
You can’t decide if TikTok ads work for you unless you crunch the numbers. Fortunately, there are two options for TikTok conversion tracking:


1. TikTok Pixel
The TikTok Pixel works similarly to Google and Facebook pixels. Once you insert the tracking code into your website, it’ll monitor key metrics.

Unfortunately, TikTok’s Pixel is client-side tracking. It can get blocked by ad blockers and privacy updates.

With TikTok tracking, your conversions won’t always be accurate.
2. Tracking eCommerce TikTok Ads with Custom Solutions
Custom tracking solutions integrate with your website and your marketing stack.

Think of it this way: TikTok tracking is a chip your visitors carry on their shoulders when visiting your store. (Sometimes, it falls off before they swipe their card.)

Custom tracking solutions use server-side tracking, which proverbially stands on the door of your business and keeps an eye on the footfall. Since it’s tech integrated on your end, you get accurate reporting.

An ad tracking tool like RedTrack measures all your conversions, even beyond TikTok. It’s your marketing headquarters.



&nbsp;

Once you integrate your platforms and channels, you’ll see your metrics in the central dashboard. You’ll know how every channel contributes to your revenue and where you get the majority of conversions from, so you can easily evaluate your return on advertising spend.
Ready to Get Started with TikTok?
TikTok is a fast-growing platform that attracts more than just a Gen Z audience. Plenty of users with high purchasing power make TikTok an excellent option for your next eCommerce advertising campaign.

Get inspired by our examples, and then get to work.

We can’t wait to see your campaign on our FYP!

9527,How to use Video Marketing Strategies for Increasing Social Media Audience,"Video marketing isn’t anything new; however, the methods of how we build our strategies will continuously change. Thanks to the popularity of social media and marketing teams, they are turning their attention to video marketing to increase their overall engagement rates on social media channels. 

Nevertheless, most businesses focus heavily on video marketing rather than promoting traditional content on social media. So, what exactly are the most effective methods for increasing your social media audience? 

Well, let’s not wait any further because, in this article, we will find out how we can use video marketing strategies to increase our social media audience. 

Let’s dive right in!
Define your goals 
At the beginning of anything you do or create, you need to define your goals. What do you want to accomplish with your videos? Which position in the marketing funnel will your videos fall into? 

If you’re a beginner, we recommend creating some goals, so you don’t feel overloaded. For example, some of your goals can be to increase your social media presence, brand awareness, customer retention rate, and much more. 

Some brands will use video marketing to set up their online ads, especially social media. However, some will have a habit of creating videos on social media for content purposes. 

After defining your video marketing goals, identify the five marketing funnel stages and see which stage your video content strategy will fall into. The five stages of the marketing funnel are: 

 	The awareness stage 
 	The consideration stage 
 	The conversion stage 


 	The loyalty stage
 	The advocacy stage

You may be wondering how this affects your video content? Knowing which stage in the market funnel you are at will allow you to identify better which type of Call to Action you can place in your video content. 
Define which social platforms you are going to use
Every social media platform has its own ways, and each channel has its own way of promoting video content. For instance, Instagram will allow you to create reels, while Facebook will offer you several types of videos. YouTube and TikTok rely on one format, so they aren’t for communicating much but for watching and promoting video content. 

If you’ve never used any video platforms, it’s best to use the one you already have an audience in, then slowly build up your audience on any other social platform you wish to use. For example, suppose you have a YouTube channel and are considering switching to TikTok. In that case, it’s better to continue to focus on your YouTube channel and simultaneously create a TikTok account that you can redirect your audience to from your YouTube channel. 

For instance, we can take RedTrack’s YouTube channel as a perfect example. They post content each week or two weeks and build an engaging audience on YouTube. Nevertheless, you can do the same and try to include a link at the end of the video to your Instagram profile, Facebook page, or any other social media channel you are thinking of promoting. 

According to a study by Hubspot, YouTube and Facebook had the highest rate of watched videos, with over 20% of respondents claiming they watch videos the most on these two platforms. While TikTok fell third in the rankings, at 15%. 
Identify which type of videos you want to create 
Even though it’s video content, every video serves its own purpose. So before you start to make videos, you will need to know what type of video you’re looking for. Here are the most popular types of videos: 

 	Demo videos: Show how your product works, taking viewers on a software or product tour and putting your product to the test.
 	Brand videos: Usually created with a large advertising campaign showing another company’s vision, mission, product and service. 
 	Event videos: Business conferences, fundraisers, or any other event. 


 	Instructional videos: Served for educational purposes. It can be an online class, “How-to,” and more.


 	Interviews: This can be user-generated content and holding interviews with your clients, a celebrity, or anyone in your team. 


 	Live videos: Usually popular on TikTok and YouTube. Live videos are an excellent way to direct contact with your audience. 
 	Promotional videos: These types of videos include promoting your product or service. This may include explaining how to use your product or using it in exciting case scenarios that urge customers to buy it.

Use transcription services 
No matter what you do, you must use transcription services in your videos. Why so? A study shows more than 90% of people watch videos without sound. Maybe they are at a concert, in a public area, or in class, and it isn’t always possible for them to watch your videos with sound. Thus, it’s important to offer transcription services. There is software you can use to transcribe your videos. 

For example, Happy Scribe’s transcription software offers up to 99% accuracy in its transcription services. In addition, it will transcribe your videos in many languages. 
Plan out your content production 
Planning out your dates of when and what you’ll post will save you time and money. You need to plan out how your videos will be filmed and created. 

Nevertheless, you can do this manually or hire a production company or agency to do the work for you. You don’t have to do anything except guide them. 

However, if you’re planning on doing everything on your own, here are a few features you can focus on but are not limited to: 

 	Identifying what your video will be about 
 	Writing a script
 	Editing a script 
 	Gathering the right people for your videos 
 	Identify each of the topics you’ll talk about. Alternatively, if you are a travel channel, you can plan out the places you’ll be going to
 	Planning out how you’ll edit the video
 	If more than one person is in the video, plan which part each person will take the scene.
 	Ensuring you are not violating copyright laws

Optimize your videos 
When we say optimize your videos, we mean to know how long your videos will be on each social platform. So, for example, if you post videos on Instagram, it can be no longer than 10 minutes, and on TikTok, it can’t be longer than three minutes. 

However, on Facebook and YouTube, it’s a whole different story. So, if you post a 15-minute-long video on YouTube and want to share it on Instagram, you will need to reduce the length to three minutes. Thus, you can try using Instagram for posting your video highlights and then redirect your audience to watch your whole video on YouTube. 

Note: Give this supplementary article a read if you want to learn more about how to build your Instagram following!
Include CTAs 
No matter what you do, how good your video is, or anything else, if you don’t include a CTA at the end, you aren’t encouraging your viewers to learn more about your product or service. 

Try including the CTA at the end or beginning of your video or telling your viewers to check the video description to learn more about your product and service. Where you include your CTA will depend all on how your video content will be. 

The greatest CTAs are those that are included with excellent video content. Try to build your content up to your CTA, and leave some curiosity at the end of your video, so users will be encouraged to click on your CTA to learn more. 
Take feedback and analyze results 
Last but not least, we have the last step, taking feedback and analyzing your end results. You won’t ever know how a video performs until you look at its metrics. Key metrics include the watch times, total views, likes, comments, and shares. However, each social media platform has different metrics, so you must see what works. 

Nevertheless, use comments as a method of feedback. While talking in your video, leave some time, in the end, to ask users what you could do better for them. After all, you always want to put your audience first and deliver what they want. This directly encourages engagement rates and even customer retention. 
Wrapping it up 
That’s all for this article. These are our top tips for video marketing strategies to increase your social media audience. All of these tips we pointed out are super important for your video content. So, what are the most important things you should remember when creating video content? 

Nevertheless, you can’t ever create great content without defining your goals and knowing which social platform your audience is most active on. Moreover, it should be your priority also to know which type of videos you are creating, to optimize your videos, depending on which social platform you are posting on, including a CTA in your video, and take feedback to see in which areas you can improve. 

After all, it’s important to listen to your audience and ensure you take the proper steps to improve your content.

9583,How To Make Stunning e-commerce Product Video,"There is no lie in the saying: a picture says a lot. However, a video is like a novel that says the story from the beginning to the end! 
&nbsp;

Research also says that customers are more inclined toward visual representation than textual and vocal descriptions of a product. Social media channels have introduced small video mediums such as Instagram has its reels, YouTube started short videos, and Facebook has its own video promoting source.

Videos may increase traffic to your blogs, websites, or e-commerce stores as well as your sales since they captivate viewers more quickly and convert three times in comparison to images.

Though there's no doubt in customers’ huge interest in video content, you can not ignore the fact they get bored with usual content very quickly. To keep your customers intrigued and captivate them to visit your website to see more of your product content, you need to raise your bar. 

We are giving you properly examined and assessed techniques for producing e-commerce product videos that are both quick and effective.
What are e-commerce product videos?
A video that exhibits your product, demonstrates it in use, and emphasizes its salient features and advantages is known as an e-commerce product video. 
When customers can't physically see your products in a store or showroom, this is the greatest approach for them to learn more about them and their advantages.
Why e-commerce product video is essential for your business
Videos are one of the least utilized e-commerce selling tactics. At the time when a consumer is considering making a deal, product videos give you the chance to demonstrate the advantages and applications of a product.
1.     Product video brings more consumer engagement
By encouraging more customers to purchase your good or service, video greatly raises brand engagement. From researched data, it is concluded that 77% of customers who watch product videos are more likely to buy the product. 
2.     Generate higher traffic to e-commerce website
If the videos are interesting, more prospects click the button to see the whole clip. It does not only make a strong engagement with your potential customers but also their visit to your website creates higher traffic and generates leads. 

As a matter of fact, the GenZ generation prefers branded product videos that showcase all the benefits of the product. 
3.     Product videos force higher conversion rate &amp; sale
An average of 9% of sales are converted by retailers who use videos on their product landing pages. 111% more money was spent by clients who watched ten or more movies than those who saw just one. A greater number of product page videos increases sales and revenue.
4.     Improves engagement &amp; builds trust
Video content is one of the finest ways to develop brand trust since it is more personal than other types of material. At every point of the marketing funnel, video can foster meaningful connections with prospects. Not only new but old generations also trust more on the brands who pitch their product through video visualization. 
5.     Eliminate consumer doubt
Without ever knowing if they would receive the deal, people donate money to Kickstarter initiatives. Why? because they become supporters as a result of the intriguing videos. Since customers could see the product and company's history, their concerns were allayed.
How to make a stunning e-commerce product video: A step-by-step approach
Every e-commerce venture needs to promote its product visually. Since customers can not examine the product physically, the features of the product must be displayed in the video. Also, you need to make a product video that can bind the client's attention.

Here's is a step-by-step guide for you to help you make a stunning e-commerce product video:
Step 1: Make pre-recording video preparations
To make a stunning video, what you need the most is high-quality equipment and cutting-edge skills. The equipment you need is:

 	A high-quality camera (You can now include cutting-edge smartphones instead of cameras.)
 	A tripod
 	A microphone
 	Lights
 	Video editing software

Based on the kind of video you intend to make, you might also require extras to appear in it and a set to shoot on. However, excellent DIY tutorial videos can also be made without a set! They may have this equipment on hand if you're hiring a production team or even a freelancer. For those new to freelancing, understanding what a pay stub is can help ensure you track your income and expenses accurately. However, if you're working alone, you'll require all of the aforementioned.
Step 2: Decide the video content and create a scenario
The video would intrigue customers only when it is worth watching and relatable to your product. Talk with your creative team if you have one or else take ideas from the internet. 

Before shooting anything, first, be clear about what will go in your content. Keep in mind that you have only 30 seconds to make your client engage with your product video. 

Try making a product video so engaging and informative that when the customer ends up watching it, they are convinced that your product will help them if they buy it. 
Step 3: Choose an effective format
You may want to select one or more of the following formats to highlight your products, depending on how you want to use your videos.
Products close-up shots
These images showcase intricate, eye-catching products and are perfect for product sites. You should include a 360-degree close-up view if the product's aesthetic appeal is crucial to generating sales. Ask yourself, what would customers examine and evaluate about the product if they were shopping in-store?
Benefits of your product (why consumers have to choose you)
These e-commerce product films demonstrate how an item functions and are perfect for showcasing complicated and useful things. Utilize them to showcase your USPs and why your product has a cornerstone over others.  

These are excellent for product sites, but they can also serve as helpful blogs and social media material.
Product Catalog
Product Catalogs aim to illustrate how your product is utilized, much like a how-to.
 But unlike “why your product”, they demonstrate your items in use, frequently in real-world situations. This makes it easier for customers to imagine holding the goods. For anything from clothing to home goods, it's a helpful structure.
Installation guidelines
Conversion might be severely hindered by uncertainty about product installation. Customers can be reassured that they can easily install your products with the help of a clear and short video. 

This type of video is perfect for any product that needs to be assembled or set up and is useful both before and after the purchase.
Product unboxing
Unboxing products is something that people love watching on the internet. It might be shocking for you that the highest paid YouTuber in 2019 was an 8-year-old kid who makes product unboxing videos. This is how popular unboxing is amongst customers. 

So, if your products come in attractive packaging, show it off and let potential customers know exactly what they'll get when they buy from you. For tech-related products, this one’s especially helpful!
Storytelling videos
What makes your product special—a distinctive design, high-quality parts, or the manufacturer's expertise? If so, inform viewers with a storytelling video that details the process used to create your goods. Stories are something that is engaging folks for a very long time. Tell your clients your product story. What inspired you to make such a product, how will it bring ease to customer’s life, etc.  
Step 4: Gathering brand materials for product video
Make a list of all the resources you already have available before you begin recording. These might consist of:

 	Branding (your logo)
 	Granting organizations' logos, product certifications, etc.
 	Earlier images or videos
 	Customer feedback
 	User-generated content

It's usually a good idea to be aware of your resources before shooting. For instance, you might wish to modify the frame if you choose to include your logo.
Step 5: Shoot your product video
Products are easier to work with than a cast, but it can be challenging to make them seem fantastic.
The main challenges when filming an e-commerce product video are always lighting and angles. 
Two off-camera lights are required, one behind the product at a 45-degree angle and the other in front of the product on the opposite side. Increase the brightness of the backlight to make your goods stand out.

Plain black or white backgrounds are ideal for displaying products. Viewers will have greater faith in you as a merchant the more professional your product videos appear to be.
Step 6: Make relevant edits to the video for various platforms before posting
During editing, keep your target viewers in mind. Videos made for broad ad campaigns should be very different from those made for retargeting advertisements. 

Be deliberate; choosing outstanding images and transitions is more important than just removing the bad parts.

Now that everything is done, click on the post button.
Tips for a great product video
Videos are the best method for showcasing your goods to the public. In actuality, you ought to always have a video for every item you sell. In addition, you may use them as an internet marketing tool to promote your website, particularly if you submit them to video-sharing services like YouTube. 

As a result, in order to build trust with your audience, you must provide informative videos that also demonstrate how to utilize the product.

Here are the following tips to make a stunning product video for you:

 	
Cater to the target audience


Serve what the customer needs to be served.

Show how your product fits into the broader context of your client's life rather than solely showcasing how elegant it is. With your product video, try to respond to the following queries:

 	     What problems does your product address?
 	     How does it improve the lives of your clients?
 	     Does it motivate the customer to take on more?
 	     Will using this product make them happier overall?

&nbsp;

 	
Keep the video short &amp; concise


Though we already mentioned the power of storytelling, do not elongate it. Make it short and to the point. Cut the five to six-minute video script you created in half, first to three minutes, then to two. They'll be grateful that you left out the fat and only provided the meat (their actual demand) for your audience or superiors.

 	
Customize your video for different platforms


Because your product video acts as an advertisement and the first impression for your goods or service, appearances matter. This means that blurry photographs or shaky video can (and will) result in a fall in product sales.

Since the finished product might be included on your e-commerce website or utilized as a Facebook advertisement, you want to be happy with it. You can completely modify your product video using Video Create to meet your preferences, whether that means adding your company's logo and fonts or enlivening your product presentation with footage from our sizable collection of trendy stock videos.

 	
Remember to show not just tell


Keep in your mind that it is a product video for a reason. Rather than explaining what your product can do or how can it help your client in making their life smooth, show it to them through a live example. Customers or viewers can even reject a video with a robust concept and aesthetics if they don't understand what you're selling by the end of it. 

As if you were still in first grade, display your product and inform your audience about it. As simple as that.

Here are some examples of the product video that both small and large e-commerce companies use:
- Demo. A demo simply displays the product in use while being demonstrated
- Explainer. The simple explainer video uses a combination of audio and text to explain a product's operation and to describe the origin story of your company. Explainer films frequently persuade people to make purchases
- Instructions. These are instructional since they offer a set of detailed instructions. Instead of being solely a marketing strategy, tutorials may be designed for people who have already paid and need assistance using a complex product.

 	
Inject some personality


Never be reluctant to use a product video to highlight your brand's personality. To set your product apart from the countless other things that are comparable to it, show off your personality.

 	
Add captions to your product video


India is a country of diversity. At every 10 miles, you can witness a language change. Keep that on the top of your mind. Add captions to your product video so that people from all regions, even customers from across borders, can understand your product

 	
 Include a call to action


This has to be added to your product video post. Many times it happens that the client likes the product from the video and explanation of it, but the way to buy the product is too complicated that they leave it there. Always add a direct link to your website from where they can buy the product effortlessly

 	
Don't miss on adding the tracking links in the description


Accurate conversion tracking is essential to determine the effectiveness of your product videos. Each video you make and each marketing channel you use for promotion can have different results. But how do you know which video or channel performs better?
You can do it with help of ad tracking tools that will be monitoring the clicks and conversions with help of tracking links. When you add tracking links under each video, you will be able to control the performance that your product videos bring.
One of the leaders of ad tracking &amp; attribution market is RedTrack — a marketing analytics solution that helps increase ROAS at every step of the funnel. If you wanna learn more about marketing analytics and make more profitable marketing decisions, consider booking a demo. 
Few examples of successful e-commerce videos
Making a product video cannot be done in just one method. Customers have different expectations for what they want to see depending on your industry. Additionally, depending on how individuals decide what to buy, they have different needs. Still, you can take inspiration from the e-commerce videos that are doing great in this field if you also want to step in and pave your way through it.

 	Logitech Crayon

A multifunctional, pixel-accurate digital pencil for all iPads (2018 and later), the Logitech Crayon increases productivity while fostering creativity. In their product review video, they keep things very simple. All they do is explain to their customer how and why their product is a necessity in customer’s life and that's all the game is about.

 	Kelty

Exxel Outdoors, LLC owns Kelty, a maker of upscale backpacks, tents, and sleeping bags. In Boulder, Colorado, the company is headquartered. Through a video where they explain how to install their product, they say it all. Why, how, and where will you need their product is all they say in their video but in such an impactful way that the customer will be agreed that they actually have to have this product in their life.

 	Native Union

Born out of a shared appreciation for high-quality products and beautiful design, Native Union develops thoughtful solutions appropriate for contemporary living. They want to inspire others to live similarly while being passionate about what they do. One of the best places to rake inspiration for your product video. In their videos, they show you how to deal with your tragedy of using multiple wires and then show how they can fix your issue. That is it.
Product videos are changing the game of marketing!
Product e-commerce videos can produce excellent results. Although I'm sure you already know this by now, it bears repeating. Carefully craft an effective video marketing strategy. The moment you begin producing these videos on your own, your marketing strategy will undergo a significant change. We recommend you use data-driven, well-researched, and well-molded content that is relevant to your audience, can engage people, and compel them to take actions such as sharing your content or making a purchase.

9596,"How to Use TikTok Ads in Affiliate Marketing: Ad Types, Audience Targeting, Costs, and ROI Tracking","In affiliate marketing, we live and thrive by our cost per acquisition. The cheaper the channel, the higher our commissions. So if you’ve already tested other methods, it may be time to consider TikTok ads for affiliate marketing.

With 67% of TikTok users saying that the social network inspires them to shop, it’s the place to be. And today, we’ll show you everything you need to know.
TikTok Ads for Affiliates 101
TikTok offers an excellent organic reach but if you want to earn more faster, paid TikTok ads are the best option. 

TikTok for affiliates works the same as any other brand; just make sure you use the CTA URLs that include your affiliate link and track your success (more on that later).
Types of TikTok Ads
You can choose from a few different video ad types:

 	In-feed TikTok ads. Appear organically as your target audience scrolls down their For You Page, and make sure to stop the scroll with engaging content.
 	TopView ads. Appear as the first video in your audience’s feeds. You’ll get increased views and conversions if your ad is engaging. 



 	Brand Takeover TikTok ads. As one of the rare TikTok ad types users can’t skip, Brand Takeover can be fantastic for your targeted affiliate marketing campaign.
 	Branded Hashtag ads. If you’re doubling down on products with viral potential, consider launching a Branded Hashtag challenge.
 	Branded Effects. Interesting for younger demographics and affiliate products they can “try on” (e.g., makeup, clothing).

Of course, you can also work with influencers. 

TikTok has a Creator Marketplace where you can reach out to micro and big influencers for collaboration. Depending on your commission, it may make sense to collaborate, but in most cases, you’ll find in-feed and TopView ads most effective. 
Finding Your Affiliate Target Audience on TikTok
If you’ve used Facebook advertising, you’ll find TikTok targeting simple. You can select a custom audience, use a lookalike audience, or target your audience based on:

 	Demographics (gender, age, location, language)
 	Psychographics (interests, behavior, devices)

Targeting is really the key to successfully advertising your affiliate products on TikTok. 

You want to ensure you’re targeting an audience with the purchasing power and demonstrated interest in topics related to your product.

For example, suppose you were selling a finance affiliate product. In that case, you’d look at users who are a part of the so-called FinanceTok, follow the community influencers, and engage with finance content.

 💡 Ready to launch?

Check out our in-depth guide to TikTok ad campaigns.  
Is My Affiliate Audience on TikTok?
If your audience is younger than 55, they’re using TikTok. 43% of TikTok’s audience is 18-24, and 32% are aged 25-34. 

Yes, TikTok is best known for promoting consumer products. However, even your B2B audience could be using it. For example, Shopify successfully uses organic and paid TikTok to reach potential entrepreneurs.

Remember: even VPs in tech companies kick back and relax. If they use TikTok, it’s the place to be. ;)

How Much Do TikTok Ads for Affiliates Cost?
Much like Google Ads, your TikTok ad cost is decided through bidding. You’ll pay for video views or clicks. 

TikTok ads used to be expensive, but these days, you can run a campaign for as little as $50 per day. 
The minimum daily and lifetime budgets are $50 on a campaign level. On an ad group level, your minimum daily budget should be $20. 
Then, multiply it by the number of days you plan to run the ad to get your minimum lifetime budget.
How to Determine Your TikTok Ad ROI
Your ROI really depends on your niche, audience, and campaign setup. However, once you launch your campaign, you need to understand precisely how much revenue you generate with TikTok.

For that, we recommend using a marketing attribution tool like RedTrack.


Why You Should Track Your TikTok Ads
TikTok offers client-side tracking. This means the tracking pixels come with visitors; if their privacy settings block tracking, you won’t understand where the conversions are coming from.

On the other hand, RedTrack offers server-side tracking, i.e., your website monitors and reports visits accurately. 

At the end of the day, you can determine if TikTok is making you - or losing - money. 

You can go even deeper to identify which creatives, campaign types, and targeting options bring in the most profits. Double down on what works, and stop wasting money on ineffective channels and campaigns.

Finally, TikTok - like any other ad platform - needs data to optimize your ad placement. Since RedTrack allows you to share the data it harnesses with TikTok, you can run more effective ads. 
Ad Tracking API for TikTok
The easiest way to track your affiliate income from TikTok ads is with RedTrack’s API integration. Once you connect it to your TikTok campaigns, you’ll be able to share RedTrack data with the ad platform, including:

 	Conversion data
 	Cost data

This way, TikTok will know to optimize your ads, and you will understand how much you’re getting back for every dollar you spend.
Compare TikTok to Your Other Affiliate Marketing Channels
As the adage goes: never put all your affiliate income in one basket. (We’re pretty sure they said affiliate income.) 

You likely use different channels, including other PPC platforms, organic traffic, and more.

Unless you want to find yourself wasting money on ineffective channels, you need razor-sharp analytics.

RedTrack monitors all your marketing channels and analyzes the cost and the revenue attribution, so you know where to pull the plug and where to invest.

For example, you might play around with data visualization filters and find out that most of your revenue comes from a special TikTok offer (as opposed to a Facebook ad).
Ready to Earn More with TikTok?
TikTok is a 2022 marketing powerhouse. However, you can’t understand your TikTok ad ROI without proper revenue attribution. 

And when you’re an affiliate marketer, every cent counts.

So give TikTok a go - but don’t forget to bring RedTrack with you!

9638,The Power of Affiliate Marketing in eCommerce,"You don’t have to hire a sales team so that someone can promote your products for you. You only need a good affiliate marketing program. If you’re ready to increase your sales with a marketing channel that generates 16% of global eCommerce sales, read on! 

We’ll show you everything you need to know about harnessing the power of affiliate marketing in eCommerce. 
Affiliate Marketing for e-commerce 101
With affiliate marketing, you partner with an affiliate - a publisher - who recommends your products to their audience and gets a commission for each sale. All you have to do is provide the tracking link and regular payouts with a good commission structure. 
The affiliate will then promote your products through various methods, including mentioning them on their blog, posting on social media, and perhaps even recording TikTok videos. And yes, influencers or bloggers are also affiliates, if you think about it. So affiliate marketing is a must-channel for e-commerce business.
Ultimately, it’s an excellent way to boost sales while reducing upfront marketing costs. You’ll only give the affiliate their cut after successfully selling your product. 
How to Build a Highly-Profitable eCommerce Affiliate Marketing Program
Let's investigate which steps you gotta take to achieve amazing results with affiliate marketing when promoting your e-commerce business.
2.1. Start with Data and KPIs
Ground your affiliate program in cold, hard data. Most affiliate programs we see never rise to their full potential (although they are profitable) because they’re not data-driven. eCommerce store owners and managers could get even more sales if only they built a framework around their data.

Establish your KPI framework early on:

 	Traffic
 	Conversions
 	Lead quality
 	Average order value (AOV)
 	Lifetime value from affiliate customers (LTV)
 	Performance and revenue per each affiliate
 	Performance per affiliate promotion method

Most eCommerce businesses only track traffic and conversions. 

Create foundations to track individual affiliates’ and channels’ performances, so you can cut inefficient channels and focus on the profitable ones.

For example, you might realize your TikTok affiliates sell better than blog affiliates.
How to Track Your eCommerce Affiliate Marketing Program
Since we’re talking data, we have to talk organization: you need a system to keep track of your affiliates and the revenue they bring in. If you use additional marketing channels, sign up for RedTrack.



RedTrack offers affiliate tracking software for e-commerce that allows you to:

 	Customize your affiliate portal
 	Invite and manage affiliates
 	Set up custom conditions and commission structures 
 	Generate, track, and attribute affiliate links and promo codes
 	Integrate affiliate marketing into your marketing ecosystem

RedTrack offers a very flexible system to set conditions for various kinds of collaborations with influencers or affiliates. For example, you can choose to pay different commissions based on:

 	marketing channels affiliates use
 	geolocation of leads / customers they achieve
 	products they advertise (product X will mean commission X1, product Y will mean commission Y1)

RedTrack specializes in marketing attribution. You can track all your marketing efforts under one roof, from PPC ads to organic reach.



RedTrack will instantly show you how much each channel generates, so you can scale what actually works. 
2.2. Know the Value to Define the Commission
In the beginning, you’ll have to rely on competitor research to determine how to differentiate your affiliate program.

However, as soon as you get data, analyze the value of your affiliates:

 	Which affiliates bring in the most revenue?
 	Which affiliates bring in the highest conversion rate?
 	Which customers tend to increase their lifetime value the most?

Look at the customer lifecycle to understand whether your acquisition cost is reasonable or too high/low. 

For example, if one affiliate’s customers generate $100 for every $1 you spend on that affiliate, it makes sense to broaden your partnership as you scale. However, paying an affiliate $30 for a customer that brings in $35 and never buys again might not make sense.
Flexible Commission Structures for eCommerce Affiliate Marketing
We’re big fans of flexible commission structures. 

You don’t have to set a fixed fee (say, 2%) for all your products. If one product is priced higher and generates better long-term conversions, use RedTrack to set up custom rules and compensate the affiliates appropriately. 



(RedTrack will also make it easier to pay affiliates commissions based on specific KPIs, including lifetime values, areas, and promotion channels.)
2.3. How to Choose Your Affiliates


(Hint: it’s easier than training your dragon.)

You’ll come across many professional affiliates in your eCommerce affiliate marketing journey. 

Traditional methods of finding affiliates for your eCommerce marketing include:

 	Reaching out to your own customers
 	Contacting industry bloggers and influencers
 	Searching on forums and marketplaces like Fiverr
 	Using an affiliate recruitment agency
 	Using affiliate marketing directories 

However, we recommend expanding your network. 

For example, influencers can join your affiliate program even if you initially scheduled them for a single campaign. If they liked your products, why not invite them to keep earning?
2.4. Monitor Your Performance
When done right, affiliate marketing can become your personal revenue generation machine. However, you shouldn’t accept just anyone into your affiliate marketing program:

 	Ensure the affiliate’s presence is legitimate and professional. (Bonus points if they specialize in your niche!)
 	Create a partner guide for any brand, style, tone guidelines, and visuals (product images, logos, graphics, etc.), you can even prepare banners that your affiliates could use. 
 	Stay in touch with your affiliates through a Slack community. Harness the feedback they get from their audience, too.
 	Discuss promotion methods with affiliates before the onboarding.

💡 Evaluate KPIs regularly. Give your affiliates time to kickstart their promotion and then analyze your results (or check your RedTrack dashboard).

Ultimately, you should identify the products, channels, and affiliates that work best for your business.
2.5. Optimize Your eCommerce Marketing with Strategic Insights
As you gather data, refine not only your affiliate program but your marketing strategy as well. 

For example, affiliate marketing may turn out to be more successful than you’d initially thought, so it would make sense to replace an inefficient channel.



Identify the products that sell best when promoted through affiliate marketing. Even if you started by casting a broad net, you should analyze the results and refine your affiliate-marketed product list in time.

Experiment with different affiliate marketing methods. You could start with a sponsored discount link but switch to free shipping promotions, seasonal add-ons, and more. Keep an open mind and consult your successful affiliates to uncover the best methods for their audiences.

9660,Ad Tracker vs Google Analytics 4: Which One Should You Choose?,"We need to talk about the damage recent privacy updates are making to your ad tracking.

It’s no secret the advertising community has been up in arms since iOS 14 updates, but the story doesn’t end there. We’re in the dawn of a new privacy-conscious era; if we want to preserve clear ROAS data, we must adapt.

How? We have two options: using Google Analytics 4 to understand visitor behavior or employing the help of powerful ad trackers.

This article will look at both options to help you choose the best tracking approach for your business.
The Key Differences Between Google Analytics 4 and Universal Analytics
Buyer journeys are labyrinthine: 

 	A lead engages with your ad on desktop
 	They forget about you
 	Their memory is jogged two weeks later
 	They visit your website on mobile
 	They subscribe to your mailing list
 	Three months later, after interacting with your social content - they convert!

These events have been impossible to track with the good old Google Universal Analytics since it was absolutely cookie-based. 

Since GA viewed every user engagement from a specific device as a separate session, you couldn't track omnichannel interactions.

You ended up without the complete picture of how conversions happen. When users switch devices, you lose track of them. Attributing conversions became mission impossible.
Since we all know about the announcement of Google Privacy Sandbox that was supposed to eliminate the tract of third-party cookies, Google had to prepare themselves for cookieless time. That's how GA4 became a mission to deliver performance tracking without third-party cookies, but also with more accuracy.


Google Analytics 4, on the other hand, takes an event-based approach. GA4 now uses multiple data points to identify a user. 

Instead of only looking at the page session from a specific device, it now matches the user ID, device IDs, and other signals (if the user is signed into their Google account).

So, as long as the user is logged into their Google account on all their devices, Google Analytics 4 defines them as a single user when they visit your website. 

It’s certainly a step forward, but is it enough?
GA4 Isn’t a Dreamboat: Attribution, European Bans, and Privacy Concerns 
GA is still limited in what it can do. 
Google Analytics 4 offers Attribution Reporting which will help to map a customer journey from the first to the last touchpoint with your brand. You can also apply various attribution models by campaign, sources, or traffic channels. 

In order to keep accurate track of your customers, GA4 requires them to be logged into their Google accounts. In order to build the buyer’s journey, Google tracks the logged-in user and uses the information for the conversion path report. With the use of Google account connection, Google “stitches” the multichannel report. But is there a way to overcome this limitation? 

Modern trackers like RedTrack map the customer journey regardless of whether they’re logged in or not. One of the newest features RedTrack released is a Conversion Path Report that does a similar job to Google Analytic’s Attribution report (mapping all the touchpoints before the conversion). But RedTrack, unlike Google Analytics, uses only raw first-party data, and therefore, provides better accuracy and data security. 




You can connect all of your marketing channels to RedTrack and get access not only to accurate conversion journeys but to various other reports (Acquisition Dashboard, Reports by campaigns, traffic channel, etc.)
If you wanna learn more about RedTrack’s abilities, take a quick demo with us.

European Google Analytics Privacy Concerns
That’s not to say that Google Analytics only thinks about searchers. On the contrary, Google Analytics has been banned in several European countries due to GDPR violations. 


The cookie data collected in GA was sent to the US, violating GDPR policies.


Since Google still hasn’t announced GA4 privacy improvements, using it to work out of the EU or with European consumers could soon become illegal. Even if you’re successfully using it, you need a plan B.
Google Analytics 4 vs. Ad Trackers: What’s the Best Solution for Your Use Case?
On the other side of the ad analytics world, we have ad trackers. 

These platforms are often configured to combine your marketing efforts and analyze them to fully understand your audience’s conversion journey. 

(Unlike Google Analytics, ad trackers offer server-side tracking. For example, RedTrack monitors different conversion events, redirect clicks, and other forms of privacy-conscious tracking instead of using cookies.)

Another reason to seriously consider an ad tracker over Google Analytics 4 is the data duration. GA4 will only store your data for 14 months. If you need to hold on to it longer (due to tracking historical performance or compliance), you’ll need to buy additional server space and storage.

On the other hand, ad trackers make everything easier. The storage and server space is pre-set for you, so you can log in and start monitoring your performance. Your data stays with you for as long as you need it to.

Should you use ad trackers? That depends on the nature of your business:
3.1. Google Analytics 4 vs. Ad Trackers for eCommerce
If you own or run an eCommerce business, you definitely can’t only rely on Google Analytics 4. 

With a mix of channels (from Facebook ads and TikTok to SEO), you need to understand where to spend your money to generate the most revenue.

GA4 will show you how visitors behave, but since it offers client-side tracking (imagine a cookie on your visitor’s shoulder), it doesn’t provide the whole picture. 

An ad tracker like RedTrack tracks eCommerce conversions on your end (server-side tracking) so you understand how campaigns affect your sales and which channels are the most profitable at a glance - without privacy concerns.

With RedTrack you will be able to integrate all of your marketing channels natively through API integration, collect all the data independently about the performance of all the marketing campaigns, and also bind this data with your e-commerce platform (like Shopify, WooCommerce, etc.).

An ad tracker for your e-commerce business will help to understand which ads actually bring you revenue results and which just suck out the marketing budget without the noticeable outcome.


3.2. Should Ad Agencies Track their ROAS with GA4 or Ad Trackers?
If you manage multiple campaigns across different channels for your clients, you need a performance marketing tracking &amp; analytics tool for ad agencies. 

Let’s be honest: understanding ROAS can be messy, even on a good day. But without an ad tracker to unify all your performance data in a central dashboard?

Mission.

Impossible.

When your clients come calling, asking to optimize ad spend, you’ll know which channel to double down on (and which ones to scrap). 



Understanding your performance across channels? No problem. RedTrack will show you performance for every channel and how it affects every client’s conversion journey.



Ultimately, GA4 is good on a granular level. But with more and more data, you don’t need time to manually comb through it. You need RedTrack — a tool that analyzes it for you so you reap the strategic insights and make profitable decisions.

Anouther amazing feature for marketing agencies by RedTrack is a Reporting Portal. You will be able to build &amp; customize this portal for your clients in order to report to your clients the results you have achieved for them, but also shed the light on how budgets were distributed and where &amp; how conversions happen for them.
3.3. Google Analytics 4 vs. Ad Trackers for Affiliate Marketing &amp; Partnership Marketing
A UTM can go a long way. If that’s all you need, Google Analytics 4 might do the trick (for now). 

But if you plan on creating a powerful affiliate or partnership marketing program, you need an ad tracker.

Affiliate marketers can easily track everything in one place with RedTrack, understanding which channels are the most profitable, campaigns’ effect on KPIs, and automating funnel optimizations.



Similarly, RedTrack enhances your partnership program by first allowing you to build your affiliate / partnership program and then customize conditions, rules, and advanced tracking. 

You’ll know how each partner is performing, which campaigns drive sales, and optimize your partnership strategy.


Summary: Should You Choose GA4 or an Ad Tracking Platform?
GA4 is an excellent analytics tool. You’ll get excellent insights into how visitors behave on your website, from scrolling to engagement.

Don’t skip GA4. Supplement it.

An ad tracking solution like RedTrack shows you the history behind the clicks and how they feed into your entire marketing strategy.

Even though one of the main GA4 benefits is the fact it’s free, don’t let that fool you. GA4’s seemingly free price tag comes with hidden costs - wasted budgets, frustration, and the need to rely on other tools to understand how your marketing campaigns are performing.

In contrast, RedTrack is the most robust ad tracking solution successfully used by leaders in numerous industries. 



No matter if you run an eCommerce business, an ad agency, or a partnership program, your RedTrack dashboard will become your single source of truth:

 	Manage campaigns
 	Understand your overall and individual channel ROI
 	Track affiliate, partner, and influencer campaign performance
 	Use secure &amp; privacy-friendly tracking
 	Go granular when you need to
 	Go big (because you can)

9671,How to track customer journey: Conversion Path Report by RedTrack,"One of the biggest troubles we see in marketing is the inability to understand which tactics or channels actually drive conversions.
Marketing attribution is an attempt to solve this complex and multilayer issue of trying to understand which investments turn to be revenue streams.
Here at RedTrack, we tried to ""grab the tail"" of this problem and create a better attribution report that will help map the whole customer journey from the first to the last touchpoint with your brand.
Now let's discover how this solution works and what kind of benefits you can get for your business.
What is marketing attribution? 
Marketing attribution is more like a science. So many approaches, so many solutions, but with a single goal. To help you as a business or as a marketer to find the winning combinations in marketing that drive measurable revenue results.

The more channels you use for marketing purposes, the bigger uncertainty you create when trying to understand what actually works and how your business revenue is made. Every paid channel (like Facebook, Google, TikTok) will tend to report conversions as their ""achievement"". Moreover, there are plenty of channels that are really hard to measure (like random links, email mentions, promo codes, and influencer marketing).
What if there was a giant mastermind that could map all of the interactions that users had with a brand before the conversion and show it in a timeline? That's where marketing attribution takes the glory.

Marketing attribution is a process of identifying the touchpoints (aka channels or campaigns) which contribute to the revenue results while assigning different values to the touchpoints in the funnel. 
💡Additional reading on marketing attribution 

How to track customer journey in marketing?
One of the most complicated tasks for marketers is to actually build a customer journey report. It required a multitude of data sets that have to be gathered in one place to present sort of a map.

But with ,the right marketing analytics solutions this task can be simplified.
One of the latest features RedTrack released is a Conversion Path Report. 



This report is very similar to Google Analytics attribution reporting — it shows the full journey of the user before the conversion. However, RedTrack's conversion path is based on raw and unsampled data which gives you better accuracy and precision when it comes to your funnel tracking.
Why Google Analytics is not the best solution to track your customer journey
Google Analytics is a go-to solution for marketers when it comes to introduction to marketing analytics. It's free, not so hard to set up and use. A true staple of your ""marketing shelf"". But what are Google Analytics limitations that prevent you from having the most results from your analytics software?



 	
Google Analytics uses sampled data


Unlike RedTrack using raw first-party data, Google Analytics uses sampled data. Raw data is the type of the data that hasn't been processed or altered — it is data as it is. When sampled data is actually a model of the raw information which gives you an understanding about the average value — not the complete marketing picture.



If you have a larger scale marketing operation this can cause quite big discrepancies which might affect your decisions in a negative way.

 	
GA is not an unbiased data source


Since Google Analytics is a part of Google corporation it will work as a self-attribution network. Meaning it can attribute sales to Google platforms even when it could be that it's not Google who is responsible for that. It's better to use unbiased marketing analytics solutions like RedTrack with native API integration with all major channels to collect data from them independently.

 	
Google Analytics attribution report doesn't include influencer marketing &amp; promo code tracking


Google Analytics hasn't made it easy yet to track the performance of affiliates / referrals or influencers, whether you wanna do it with links or you wanna use promo codes. Since partner marketing is a big part of modern marketing strategy, it's super important to measure the results it brings you.

On the other hand, RedTrack has a complex solution for those who invest in affiliate or influencer marketing — Partnership Portal.
With the use of Partnership Portal, you will be able to instantly issue tracking links or promo codes for all of your partners and track their performance. This same data will go to your Conversion Path report as one of the touchpoints users can possibly have on their way to the conversion.
Customer journey tracking: does your type of business need it?
You might think that customer journey tracking is too advanced and it's not for your business. The truth is: the more you invest in marketing — the more clarity you need to find in your investments to make the best of it. The customer journey become more &amp; more twisted and complicated every year, since the number of touchpoints doubles before the user actually converts.
And your funnel is probably getting more &amp; more complicated day by day. And in order to track your funnel properly, you need a solution that will be able to map all of those touchpoints.



You need to track your funnel if you are:


 	
E-commerce business that invests not only in Facebook Ads (and you should)


We already talked quite a bit on our blog and MarTech Youtube channel

about investing in various marketing channels, especially if you are e-commerce, you should think of diversifying your marketing strategy.

One of the amazing marketing channels for e-commerce is TikTok Ads and TikTok influencer marketing. That being said, if you have more than one marketing channel, you will need a Conversion Path report to identify trends in customer behaviour that support purchases.

 	
SaaS due to the longer cycles


SaaS is ""famous"" for pretty long conversion cycles. Your customers probably find your thorugh paid channels, but oftentimes the actual conversion happens from direct search. In order to understand the real value of your marketing investments, Conversion Path report will shed some light on this twisted journey.

 	
Marketing &amp; advertising agency


In order to build better reports for your marketing clients, Conversion Path report will offer a different picture on how investment into marketing turnes into revenue. Oftentimes it can get hard to explain why this or that channel takes so much of our budget. RedTrack's customer journey report will give a new perspective on conversion trends to explain the real impact.
Benefits of Conversion Path report by RedTrack for funnel tracking
With RedTrack you can perform accurate tracking of your campaigns from all the marketing channels. We use only raw and 1st party data to comply with all the privacy regulations but still provide you with real-time data and accurate reports.
The Conversion Path report will open an opportunity for you to analyze the results of your marketing on different levels: channels, campaigns, ad groups, ads.

We added the following filters that will allow you to track conversions based on the campaign, event, and date.

Using this data you will have a couple of benefits that your company can turn into increased revenue.
Optimize conversion rate based on accurate &amp; multichannel data 
To see more critical data insights into your performance you can break down the data by channel, campaign, ad group, and multiple other dimensions.

Collected data will show you which channels or ads perform better, and you can use these insight to optimize your performance. Moreover, with RedTrack you can also gain control over your CRs (conversion rate) and automate performance accordingly. Simply set rules to stop ad waste to scale winning combinations.
Allocate budgets knowing the complete performance 
Analyze investments in your marketing not from Facebook Ads Manager point of view or through reports by Google. Customer oftentimes make purchase decision hectically and through direct search if they already know your company. But if that happens, it doesn't matter that there was no influence of paid marketing channels. 
Conversion Path Report by RedTrack allows you to see the trends and the sequence of channels that cause users to buy. When using this approach, you can allocate marketing budgets knowing the exact value of each channel of campaign. 
Scale ROAS, not the number of campaigns 
Oftentimes, it's not about the number of campaigns or ads you run, it's about the actual profitability and revenue that these campaigns or ads attract. Analyzing performance &amp; trends help you find the winning channels, campaigns, as well as winning combinations (like combination of winning channels).
Conversion Path Report by RedTrack helps you find those winners, scale them and get a better ROAS (return on investment).

9695,Get Inspired: Creative Black Friday Ad Banners for 2022 Campaigns,"Don’t judge a book by its cover but do judge the ad by its creativity. If you plan to launch an advertising campaign this Black Friday, don’t pull any punches. 

Instead, get inspired by the top 5 Black Friday ad banners for 2022!
#1 More Is Better or: How Kiehl Does Black Friday Ad Banners
One special offer is great - but the more, the merrier! 

Kiehl offered their audience the pick of the litter; they'd get one-off discounts or shop from a selection of fabulous discounted products.



Seeing this ad banner on social media stops the scroll immediately; we’re all drawn to choosing from a pile of goodies.
Key Lessons from Kiehl's Black Friday Ad Banner

 	Show audiences all the options you provide. Don’t stop at a discount; create a special offer and add something extra (like Kiehl’s gift package) for the highest order values.

Identify your best-sellers and curate them for your new Black Friday audiences. Use an ad tracking tool to identify the best campaigns per channel and promote products with the highest chances for conversion.
#2 Set the Mood with Your Black Friday Ad Banner
As marketers, we often over-optimize for the benefits, forgetting that people make purchasing decisions with their emotions and then logically explain them. This holiday season, inspire your audience by learning from the best:



AT&amp;T could have created a generic banner, but instead, their ad creative transports the viewer onto a ski slope. 

They’re no longer invited to only replace their phone - they’re invited to a new beginning.
Key Lessons from AT &amp; T's Holiday Ad Banner

 	Why do people purchase your products? Think about a pair of shoes. Do they buy sneakers to get to places they want to be faster? Do they buy stilettoes to feel glamorous? Understand the emotion and emulate it through your ad creative.

Let the visuals take the reins. Create a stand-out ad creative first, and mention your offer second. Remember that the goal is to stop the viewer from scrolling and consider your ad.
#3 If You Can Make Them Laugh, You Can Make Them Shop
You might remember the Dollar Shave Club for its bold advertising. Nothing’s changed when it comes to their holiday campaigns:



Even though this is a Christmas ad, it’s never too soon to start thinking about gifts for your loved ones. 

DSC knows it well, so they combined humor with a great gift-shopping deal.
Key Lessons from Dollar Shave Club's Black Friday Campaign 

 	Is your audience open to humor? Leverage it. Humor helps people relate to your brand and seriously consider purchasing. Turn preconceptions about who the audience is supposed to be around or use inside jokes for smaller niches.
 	Don’t forget gift shopping. If you can, test new audiences and target people who might get your product as a gift for the important people in their lives.

#4 Make a Celebration out of the Black Friday Sale like Apple
Black Friday sales might be expected, but that doesn’t mean they can’t be festive. Learn from Apple to create an ad banner that says a lot in a few words:



Another great pointer is the fact that Apple promoted its offer in advance. Since Apple products come at a higher price point, the early announcement helped their audience prepare.
Key Lessons from Apple’s Black Friday Ad Banner

 	Announce your offer ahead of time (especially if your products are expensive). Give your customers time to prepare for the purchase with a time-limited discount.
 	Your ad creative doesn’t have to say much. Reduce your copy to its essential idea to make it scannable and easy to understand

#5 Gamify Your 2022 Black Friday Ad Banner


Finally, your Black Friday ad banner doesn’t have to be a monologue where you present your offer, and the viewers decide if they want to take you up on it. 

It can be a fun activity for everyone with some gamification.

Kohl’s ran a multichannel campaign on social media, which included organic Twitter content. However, you can use their example to create an ad banner that makes people engage with your ad (especially on social media).
How to Gamify Your Black Friday Ad Banner

 	Emphasize your referral offer or a discount. If one of your Black Friday offers hinges on the shoppers doing something, mention it in your ad.
 	Incorporate quizzes, guessing games, or fill-the-blanks (that naturally end up with your products as the solutions). 
 	Don’t forget that you are launching an ad. Include CTAs, highlight your best-selling products, and stay engaged with the audience.

How to Prevent High Costs and Maximize Your 2022 Black Friday ROAS
Your ad creative is just the cherry on top of a well-structured Black Friday campaign. 

If you want to maximize your results this holiday season, you’ll need to:
1. Prevent High Costs for Ineffective Channels
Since holiday ads can get expensive, ensure you have clear information on the most profitable channels ahead of time.

For example, if you run Facebook, Google, and TikTok ads simultaneously, review your RedTrack multichannel report to understand the ROI for each channel. Then, plan for the increasing costs by focusing on the most effective channels.


2. Prepare Your Affiliates and Partners for Your Black Friday Sale
Prep is half the work, so get in touch with your most profitable partners and set up a tracking framework. If you’re unsure about affiliate and influencer promotion this holiday season, dive into your historical performance to find the partners who generated the most revenue for your business.


3. Improve Your Post-Black-Friday Marketing by Analyzing Conversion Journeys
Before you launch a high-impact Black Friday campaign, get your tracking framework in place. 

If your customers see your promotions across different channels, you need to know which one drove the conversion. 

Then, after Black Friday passes, you’ll have the right insights to make every day your Black Friday.



So if you need a reliable marketing partner this holiday season, check out RedTrack’s eCommerce tracking solution. 

We’ve helped thousands of eCommerce stores grow with the power of easily understandable data.

If you’re ready to get the best out of your most profitable segments, read on! We’ll show you how to prepare for Black Friday 2022 in eCommerce.
How to Make the Most of Black Friday 2022 in eCommerce
Sales and discounts are already a given for Black Fridays and Cyber Mondays. Every consumer expects them, so you’ll have to go the extra mile to draw their attention to you. 
Craft your Black Friday offer

When planning your BFCM campaign, you have to start by thinking about your unique offer during the holiday season. In order to do that perform the following analysis:

 	Analyse your audience: is your product something that they have been planning to buy for a long time? Is that something that they most likely will gift to someone else?
 	Think about buyer's intent: depending on the category of the product, consumers will have different driving desire to make the purchase. If it's something more luxurious, then it will be a desire to treat yourself, etc. Your offer during BF has to play around the buyers intent and eliminate consumer objections. 
 	Which of your products are they looking to purchase at a discount the most? After the analysis of your Target audience and their buyer's intent, analyze what kind of goods they would want the most and what would be the best price during BF campaign to make sure you run more sales. 

Dive into your data. For example, by reviewing your website visitor behavior, you can identify the products people are highly interested in (but which may come at a higher price point). 

Adding a chatbot to your website won’t help much if you leave opportunities like FAQs and reviews on the table. Think about your unique customer journey.
Marketing doesn't stop at Black Friday
Think long-term. With a good campaign, you’ll get plenty of traffic you can convert into repeat customers. 

Make sure you establish your eCommerce analytics framework ahead of time so you can analyze conversion quality, the best marketing channels, and other data to grow your revenue in the long term.
You might consider to save your audiences from Black Friday campaigns and later retarget to them so they could become recurring customers. 
2. The Best eCommerce Black Friday Strategies and Tactics
2.1. Respond to Consumer Behavior Changes
Black Friday has come a long way from standing in line trying to snag the 32” LED TV. These days, consumers have different expectations:

 	Longer-lasting Black Friday deals
 	Marketing through multiple touchpoints and channels
 	Premium support

For example, Target gradually added more savings to their product deals from November 25. 

Similarly, Walmart launched a gamified campaign (keeping up with the Gen Z Tik Tok audience) where consumers were invited to “unwrap” Black Friday deals:

Your Black Friday campaigns tell new and existing customers a lot about your brand. Give them the experience they truly want - on top of a discount.
2.2. Test New Opportunities with Your Black Friday Campaign 
Instead of a typical Black Friday campaign, IKEA ran a #BuyBackFriday campaign. Their customers could return used furniture for store credit and a discount.

What opportunities do you have lying in wait?

 	Mystery gifts (like The Verge)
 	Value-first campaigns (like IKEA)
 	Experiences (like SpaceCamp)
 	Interactive &amp; gamified shopping experiences (like MeUndies’ virtual event)

Promoting through affiliates and influencers



Offer something special to your existing customers like Feel Unique. Don’t make them feel like another number on the visits counter.

The more you innovate, the more you'll attract customers. And with proper tracking, you’ll know which campaign drove the most revenue.
2.3. Integrate Your Black Friday Campaign into Your Funnel
Make sure your Black Friday campaign is tightly integrated with your funnel:

 	Are you drawing in customers who are aware of their problems and potential solutions or unaware?
 	Do you have a sequence to retain first-time customers?
 	Do you have a referral program in place for your existing customers?
 	Is your tracking enabled to monitor results from different channels?
 	How do your Black Friday campaigns affect retention, lifetime value, and average order value?

For example, a well-executed influencer campaign may result in higher customer lifetime value than traditional social media advertising. If you run your campaign through multiple channels, you’ll also want to know which channel contributed most to the conversion. 



Similarly, you should have clearly defined audience segments. 

Then, give the best customers (typically around 3-5% of your customer base) your best offer, an extra special discount, or a bundle. 
2.4. Remove Obstacles to Conversion
Do everything to remove obstacles to conversion, and then promote through retargeting. 

For most B2C businesses, retargeting for Black Friday may not be necessary. But if you’re in B2B or your products come at a higher price point, identify the most profitable audience segments and go after them.

Make sure you answer all your audience's questions on your website or in your marketing collateral. Don’t stop at clarifying your product - clarify your service:

 	Who should they contact for support?
 	When can they expect the delivery?
 	What are the shipping and payment terms?

Optimize your checkout process. Instead of trying to gather every possible data point, focus on the information you need for the transaction. Give your customers the ability to check out immediately, and consider how route planning made easy can streamline delivery options to enhance the overall experience.
2.5. Go Big with Black Friday (or Go Home)
Don’t stop at just one campaign. Be everywhere your customers are!

Learn from TestGorilla’s multi-channel campaign. 

First, they serve an educational ad:



Then, they reach out via email: 



In case their customers are shopping around for options (and they usually always do), TestGorilla runs branded keyword campaigns against their competitors:



In eCommerce, your campaign mix could be more social. But no matter what you do, you need to understand where your customers are most susceptible to your offer and what could prevent them from purchasing from you.
3. How to Track Your Performance During Black Friday
Don’t throw money at your campaigns and hope for positive results. Instead, focus on data and track the right metrics:

 	Set up reporting - Which metrics do you need to understand the details of your campaign success? Is the number of conversions enough, or do you want to know how much you’re paying for every acquisition? List critical metrics and set up the reporting in a marketing attribution tool like RedTrack.
 	Identify profitable channels - Where do your best leads come from? Distinguish every channel with tracking codes so you don’t waste money.
 	Leverage promotion and discount codes - Use dedicated promo and tracking codes to work with affiliates or influencers. You want to work with the best of the best.

How Does Your Black Friday Campaign Affect Your Marketing in the Long Term?
Metrics and reports will help you even after Black Friday is over. 

Using RedTrack, you’ll also know how each channel contributed to the final conversion.



The conversion path report will show you which channel, location, device, and source converted the most. Even better, you’ll learn how the source affected your customers’ lifetime value.



&nbsp;

For example, you might find that your Facebook ads are where the serious revenue is! 

After all - you’ve spent so much time planning your Black Friday campaign. Why not learn from it and replicate the success at scale?

9731,Ad tracking & analytics guide for your Black Friday campaign 2022,"It's that time of the marketing year again. A crazy and hectic time. And you know that as a marketer you have to make the most of it.

Making the most of it usually comes with working around data. But for many marketers it can be really challenging task.
This guide will cover analytics that will help you make the most of your Black Friday campaign, scale revenue and ROAS as well as avoid unnecessary budget losses on non-performing initiatives, channels or ads.
Here we will cover:

 	How to set up ad tracking for your Black Friday marketing campaign
 	How to make sure you gather accurate data
 	How to use the collected data as an insight discovery tool
 	How to scale your revenue during Black Friday with the use of analytics

Step-by-step: How to set up analytics for your Black Friday campaign
Let's start our step-by-step guide for successful tracking and analytics during BFCM.
Step 1: Choose analytics tool
This is step number 1 and it's gonna define the quality of your analytics, as well as expected result. You might have a temptation to use Google Analytics to track your performance during Black Friday. But I would like to instantly make you doubt this decision.

Even though Google Analytics is amazing for tracking your website performance, it's not gonna do such a good job at tracking the performance of your campaigns, especially if you multiple marketing channels: paid ads, influencer marketing, email marketing, etc.

So I would really offer you to consider a Google Analytics alternative. 

In order to successfully run analytics during Black Friday, you will need to get to the understanding of ad tracking. 
With the right analytics tool you will be able to:
- gather performance data across marketing channels you are using
- perform server-side tracking that will ensure accurate data
- get a single dashboard to analyze all performance results
- track everything: clicks on paid ads, link clicks around the web or in your socials, promo codes from influencers, affiliates' performance &amp; more.
If you wanna analyze marketing data and optimize your performance, you should check the analytics &amp; automation solution from RedTrack.
Step 2: Plan out events you wanna track
Next step would be analyzing your campaign from the point of the events you want to track during Black Friday. Possibly, you might consider building a funnel out of tracked events.



Examples of the events you might wanna track during Black Friday:

 	Click
 	View item
 	Add-to-cart
 	Checkout
 	Purchase
 	Upsell

What could be your tracking funnel?
As an example you can think of sales funnel like that:

Step 3: Take care of integrations &amp; set up tracking
If you choose your analytics tool wisely, this step should come easy. Why?

Because you will have templates for integrations with all the necessary platforms: marketing channels (FB Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads, Bing, Taboola, Outbrain), e-commerce platforms,  affiliate networks, CRMs, finances, data visualization, etc.
In case of RedTrack, we have 200+ integrations that will simplify the work when it comes to creating a unified tracing &amp; analytics system. 

 	You will be able to connect your paid channels (Google, FB, TikTok,etc.) via API integrations and perform server-side tracking. Meaning having accurate data about clicks, conversions and costs of each campaign.
 	You will be able to connect your e-commerce platforms (Shopify, WooCommerce, BigCommerce, etc.) to connect your shop with the marketing channels and align data
 	You will be able to connect it to your CRM (like HubSpot) or connect Tableau (to visualize data)


Take care of installing scripts, pixels, and tracking links
Ad tracking is based on tracking parameters (UTMs). 

UTM parameters were implemented by Google for Google Analytics tracking, but today most tracking systems implemented their own tracking parameters for analytics.

Example of a tracking link with UTM parameters
https://bootsshop.com?cmpid=5e6c7b85c6565a0001718aa0&amp;sub1={replace}&amp;utm_keyword={keyword}&amp;sub4={adgroupid}&amp;sub5={creative}&amp;sub6={campaignid}&amp;sub8={adposition}&amp;ref_id={gclid}
Everything that goes in {} are tracking parameters: keyword, adgroudID, creative, position etc.

After a user clicks this link the parameters will be exchanged on real values coming from this particular user: which keyword was used, which ad group the ad corresponds to, the campaign ID, etc.
🚀Read a detailed guide on what is ad tracking here. 
Every channel has a different and unique approach when it comes to installing tracking. Generally, when it comes to using an e-commerce ad tracker you will set up pixels when integrating the channel with the tracking system. You will get templates in order to do that so it won't be a big problem.
Even better if you have native integration between your e-commerce platform and tracking system because then you are able to collect data about the conversions (or purchases) and send it to advertising platforms for improving the work of the optimization algorithms (maximizing signals).

Another important feature you should be looking out for is the Universal tracking script. 

💡With RedTrack.io's universal script you are able to place it on your website to collect the clicks from any source and easily build multichannel reports. 💡

Step 4: Verify data accuracy
The next step to ensure your accurate step would be to verify data accuracy between various systems.

Compare the stats that your Ads Manager shows or Google Analytics, for example, with the results of the tracking tool you use and the backend data about the purchases.

If the data doesn't match you will have to perform additional actions to align it.
What's an okay discrepany in conversion data?
This is a very complex question and it depends on your marketing channels, as well as on your shop set up. Usually, the data should match close to 100%.

But in our experience, many users try to fight ""the discrepancy issue"". If you are only looking at Facebook data, you won't get 100% accuracy. The reason for that is Facebook attribution models.

The same happens with the whole Google ecosystem. Both Facebook and Google are self-attribution networks. It means that these channels are advertising platforms (and you pay them to run ads) and they report their success (which means it's really beneficial for these platforms to report better numbers). Many times Google and Facebook might be misinforming you on the performance shown simply because the system is built this way.

That's why it's super important to use independent and unbiased marketing analytics tools, like RedTrack. 

We collect all the data via API integrations independently to ensure data accuracy and matching across all platforms. In-build integration with Shopify allows to receive the data from the back-end of the store and send all the needed conversion data to advertising platform to improve the performance, which is a great bonus.

However, if the data between your ad tracker of choice and the back-end of the store doesn't match, continue troubleshooting.

 	Check the accuracy of the setup parameters
 	Try to integrate advertising channel one more time
 	Verify that all pages have tracking script installed

If you add anything to your tracking setup, make sure to follow the same (initial) logic to ensure that everything will be recorded and reported accurately.
Step 5: Set up automation (if your tool allows it)
One extra step when it comes to impeccable tracking &amp; analytics system is automation.

When you get access to performance data collected through your tracking tool, you might wanna use it to prevent ad loss and scale what works. And that's exactly what automation is there for.

That is something that you won't find in Google Analytics, so you will need an analytics &amp; automation platform for that.
With RedTrack's Automation Extension you will be able to:

 	Receive up to 1-minute cost updates from your campaigns. This feature is extremely important if you have larger ad spend. The more you spend, the more often you might wanna receive data about the spending and direct the budgets to the ads that work.
 	Create Stop &amp; Go Rules. Set up the rules for your campaigns to manage them. For example, if CR &lt; 3%, then stop the campaign. It's an easy AI technique that will help to spend less time monitoring and more time enjoying the fruits of the campaigns.
 	Create Scale Rules: Change budget or change bids to scale performance based on the Cost, CPA, Conversion, ROI, Revenue, EPC, and other performance metrics. One rule can be applied to multiple campaigns.

9742,Performance Marketing Automation in post-cookies era,"What's the dream of every marketer?

I guess it's not gonna be possible to narrow it down to a single dream. We all marketers are unique creatures, I'm sure.

But there is something I would definitely want to receive from technology.
To have space to be creative more often.
Marketing professions are quite creative, they require constant innovation and a permanent state of looking at things from a different angle. But marketing also comes with crazy seasonality, deadlines, numbers, tables, and spreadsheets. And a lot of pressure.

That really ruins all the ease and creativity that comes with such an amazing job.

And that's why for me personally and for the community with who I stay in touch, ANY automation tool just really saves the day.

And today we are gonna talk about Marketing Automation for performance marketers. If you are running ads on multiple ad channels, if you have a high ad spend, you need these automation tactics to save your precious time and scale revenue.

Agenda:

 	What is Marketing Automation?
 	Is Marketing Automation possible without cookies?
 	How to automate your campaigns' performance across multiple channels?
 	What is campaign cost-updates?
 	How to prevent ad loss and scale revenue with use of Automation.

And now, let's start!
What is Performance Marketing Automation?
How many marketing channels you use? (Think of the answer) Facebook, Google, Email, Affiliates, SMM? This you probably will be able to count.

How many campaigns you run on each channel? (This is gonna be a harder one to calculate fast)

And how many ads do you have? How many creatives are in rotation? (The larger your marketing is, the more complicated it's gonna be to come up with a number here).

Imagine there is some magical fairy creature that has an answer to all of that. In a matter of second.

Usually, that's your Analytics tool.

If you chose wisely, this tracking system has the data about all of your marketing channels, campaigns, ad groups and ads. Not just the number of those, but also all the performance stats: CRs, CTRs, AOVs, LTVs, Add-to-carts... and this list continues pretty endlessly.

And now imagine that the tool you have can OPERATE according to the marketing data it has. This means managing, optimizing, stopping what doesn't work, and scaling what actually performs amazingly.

These are Performance Marketing Automation Rules.

If we take our own example, we have newly released Advanced Automation Extension from RedTrack. 

With this smart tool you get an ability to:
 Receive Cost Updates on your campaigns (up to 1 min update frequency). You will see the costs across all your campaigns to understand how you spend and how this spending turns into revenue.
 Scale rules: these are special types of rules that help you manage campaigns' budgets and bids to scale performance based on the Cost, CPA, Conversion, ROI, Revenue, EPC, and other performance metrics. One rule can be applied to multiple campaigns.
 Stop &amp; go rules: pause campaigns, ad groups/ ad sets, ads, and blacklist placements based on the Cost, CPA, Conversion, ROI, Revenue, EPC, and other performance metrics. Relaunch paused objects if KPIs improve with delayed conversions data.
Alerts &amp; Notifications: receive updates on your performance. Send e-mail or web-hook notifications (through Slack, for example) based on benchmark KPI, including Cost, CPA, Conversion, ROI, Revenue, EPC, and other performance metrics.

Is Marketing Automation possible without cookies?
Yes. Without third-party cookies for sure.

You have to ensure that your tracking tool operates without third-party cookies and relies only on first-party data.

First-party data is your guarantee to comply with privacy regulations (like GDPR) but at the same time use this data for optimization &amp; automation.

🚀 Read about the role of raw &amp; first-party data for advertisers 🚀

How to automate marketing campaigns' performance?
If you want to start automating instead of constant monitoring, you will have to land on Analytics &amp; Automation system first.

Automation is not possible without data. Therefore, your tracking tool should have impeccable quality when it comes to data.

All the clicks, conversions, add-to-carts, and initiate checkouts have to be measured.

Once the data is gathered, Automation is possible.
Prevent loss and scale revenue
When it comes to preventing loss, you will find these 2 features of value: Stop &amp; Go Rules and Alerts &amp; Notifications. 
When you set Stop Rule, you set a specific KPI for your campaign. If this KPI is not met, the campaign will be automatically stopped. You can set a KPI according to the cost of the campaign, CTR, CR, or other important for your business metrics.

Another way to stay up to date with your campaigns' performance without over-monitoring is to set Alerts &amp; Notifications.

When your KPI is not reached, you will be updated instantly.
Value of cost updates frequency
This one is big and I feel like I have to elaborate more on it.

I want you to calculate now what's your monthly ad spend.
Let's take a number of $50K ad spend per month (quite average for e-commerce). With simple math, we can calculate that you spend $70/hour on ads.

Every hour that you run ads without proper optimization, you might be wasting this budget. But you could be distributing it with better accuracy and with much bigger returns. But ONLY if you know the exact costs of each campaign, ad group, or ad.

Therefore, the larger your ad spend is, the more often you need to receive your cost updates on the campaign's performance.

Many of our users at RedTrack reported that they need real-time cost updates in order to monitor the exact spend their campaigns are making and understand the results behind those costs.

That's why we developed a 1-minute cost update for your marketing. It's as close to real-time updating as possible and it will keep you in the loop of all things finances of your campaigns. The other Automation plans also include 5-minute and 15-minute cost updates.
Value of Scale Rules
Another amazing feature is helping to make your campaign management smart. When you can only stop underperforming campaigns — you get only half of the automation job done. But if you can automatically scale campaigns that work, that's a whole other discussion.

That's when you can experience Performance Marketing Automation Magic.

In RedTrack we released this possibility as Scale Rules. These rules allow you to manage the budget and the bids of the campaigns.

It works the same wat: you set a certain KPI and if the campaign or ad hits the benchmark, they RedTrack will help you distribute the budget and bids accordingly. You will spend more on the hottest ads, but that only means that you will scale revenue.
Start Automation today
Performance Marketing Automation is a must-have solution you should obtain if you invest in advertising larger budgets. Try the solution by RedTrack to automate your routines, get rid of manual tasks and scale your business ROI.

9807,Top 5 ClickBank Offers: Best Practices for Affiliates,"ClickBank may be a bank full of fantastic affiliate offers, but some products are more profitable. Fortunately, we’ve been in the trenches of affiliate marketing, and today, we’ll show you the top 5 ClickBank offers and how you can make the most of them with best practices for affiliates.

Let’s dive in! 
1. The Best ClickBank Affiliate Offers Hide in the Dietary Supplements Category
It is no surprise that the best ClickBank offers are in the dietary supplements category. 

Looking at their numbers, you’ll see all the usual suspects, some of which have been top-performing for months and years:

 	Exipure (EPC (average earnings per click): $0.93; average ClickBank payout (APV): $152.62)
 	Protetox (EPC: $2.06; APV: $141.15)


The Best Way to Promote Dietary Supplements as a ClickBank Affiliate
While ClickBank shows the products' EPC and APV, you will need to do your own legwork to sell the products. When it comes to dietary supplements, we’ve found that Facebook Ads and Google Display Ads work best.

However, some affiliates swear by YouTube ads - especially for products with comprehensive affiliate programs like Protetox. The brand frequently launches special promotions, allowing you to earn even more.

No matter the advertising channel you choose, make sure you set up your ClickBank tracking via RedTrack, so you fine-tune your marketing strategy.
2. Help Your Audience Stay Fit with Fitness ClickBank Offers for Affiliates while Tracking Upsells
If your audience loves improving their physical health, they will love some of the products on ClickBank’s marketplace. In particular, ClickBank affiliates love the following two health &amp; fitness offers:

 	Yogaburn (Avg commission: $14/sale)
 	Venus Factor System (Avg commission: up to 75%/sale)


How to Promote Weight Loss &amp; Fitness Products as a ClickBank Affiliate
Fitness products have a vast upsell potential (especially comprehensive programs like Yogaburn). 

All you have to do is ensure your audience stays engaged even after the first purchase. Create a retention (or perhaps even referral) program, set up email sequences, and produce helpful content.

Since you’ll want to know about every single conversion and upsell, it’s a ClickBank affiliate best practice to enable conversion tracking. Data slips through the cracks with typical (ad) tracking. We recommend using S2S (server-side) conversion tracking so you get accurate payouts and know which channels work best for your ClickBank offers.


Know exactly which channel is over- and under-performing. Then, double down on what works!

3. Find a Professional ClickBank Offer like Midas Manifestation (and Make Your Work 50x Easier)
Self-help is all the rage these days, so it’s no surprise that Midas Manifestation is one of the highest-converting ClickBank offers.

If it’s a good fit for your audience, it’s worth checking out for the $3 EPC, up to 90% commission, and credit for upsells and follow-up sales. 

Plus, you can promote the Midas Manifestation product as an affiliate even on Facebook Ads. 


ClickBank Affiliate Best Practice: Look for Affiliate Offer Professionalism
Only some ClickBank products have well-structured affiliate programs. Others may waste your time because you'll have to spend your resources to promote them.

In contrast, products like Midas Manifestation show clear signs of a professional affiliate offer:

 	You get an email swipe file with well-performing email templates.
 	They offer a Facebook Ad kit and plenty of banners.
 	Need help? They have a support team that you can contact.

Since products like Midas Manifestation support different channels, ensure your multi-platform ad tracking is solid.



Don’t waste your budget on ineffective channels and campaigns; identify the best approach with an affiliate-friendly marketing attribution tool like RedTrack.
4. Are There Profitable Affiliate ClickBank Offers for Hobby Products? You Bet!
And Ted’s Woodworking is one of them! If your audience loves DIY-ing or woodworking, they’ll love the library of constantly updated woodworking plans.

(As an affiliate, you’ll love the upsell potential. ;))

Ted’s Woodworking program typically sees 10% conversions on cold and 23% on warm traffic, with upsell opportunities and membership offers you can use to generate more revenue.


Best Practices for Promoting ClickBank Affiliate Products in the Hobby Niche
The riches are definitely in the niches and when promoting a hobby product, choose yours wisely. 

Don’t be afraid to hop on Reddit or other forums to understand how your audience thinks and behaves, so you can profitably position your hobby ClickBank product.

Keep your audience engaged. The DIY and woodworking niches are constantly growing, but don’t let existing customers slip away. 

Measure your success. For example, evaluate how well your existing affiliate customers respond to specific channels. Do they prefer organic content? Google Ads retargeting? TikTok?

Test, mix &amp; match, and don’t forget to track!
5. What Is the Best ClickBank Infoproduct Offer (and How Can You Promote It)?
If your audience loves their furry friends, check out Doggy Dan’s Online Dog Trainer.



It consistently ranks well for commissions, conversions, and other ClickBank metrics, so it’s worth exploring. Just make sure you…
Best Practices for ClickBank Affiliate Marketing
When it comes to info products, you need great content. If your audience responds well to the ClickBank product, don’t be afraid to go all-in:

 	Explore how competitors promote similar products on YouTube, TikTok, and via search traffic
 	Create content with honest reviews
 	Respond to frequent questions 
 	Address common objections

Then, wrap it all up into a fantastic experience and watch your conversions skyrocket!
Bonus Tip for Maximizing Your ClickBank Revenue
If you’re serious about ClickBank affiliate marketing, don’t leave money on the table with outdated conversion tracking. Instead, sign up for RedTrack and integrate it with ClickBank in a few easy steps!

Enabling powerful tracking only takes a few minutes. Then, it delivers extra revenue and insights, so you get more value from every single ClickBank product in your affiliate roster.

 	Scale Rules: how to scale revenue with use of this feature;
 	Schedule Rules: which scenarios require this feature;
 	Smart Links and Auto-optimization for affiliates;
 	Why you should start automating your performance now!

Let's start this year with crazy profits together with RedTrack!
What is Automation Rules By RedTrack?
We have implemented a new segment of RedTrack platform — Automation. It is meant to cut your manual work with use of our algorithms and give your opportunity to focus on creating more.
While RedTrack will be cutting non-performing ads, scaling the best ones, or scheduling ads upon your needs.

There are various types of Rules we are implementing to the platform:

 	Pause &amp; Restart;
 	Scale;
 	Schedule.

We will cover each of them further, but before we learn about Rules, it's really important to discuss what is cost updates.
Campaigns' Cost Updates: Why is it so important for advertising automation?
Costs are important for several reasons:

 	It's important to have data about all of the costs of your paid campaigns in one place so you can track how much you spend in general
 	It's almost a crucial metric that your ad tracking solution should be calculating to calculate returns: ROI and ROAS
 	And finally, the costs of the campaigns is probably the most important variable for the automation of your paid campaigns.

How can you receive cost updates for your campaign?
For that, your tracker or analytics solution has hot to have API-based updates. For example, RedTrack can receive cost with API integration with these channels (and still counting): Facebook Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads, Revcontent, Bing Ads, Exoclick,Outbrain, Richpush, Taboola, Traffic Junky, Zeropark.
Cost updates as an important metric to keep an eye on
Whether you are automating your performance with Rules or not, cost updates is still a crucial number. To understand that, we need to make a simple example.
Let's think of the number you spend on ads a month. Let's say it's $50k of ad spend each month.

That means that every day you spend approx. $1,6k. Some creatives are actually bringing you revenue, and some campaigns eat the budget with no real returns. And using the right software can help you make the most from your ad spend, while also ensuring you don't waste your budget for nothing.

How do you know which campaigns or ads bring your dollars back as ROI? Here the cost update feature comes really handy. Without consistent cost updates, we don't know the actual and timely ROI of every campaign, ad set or ad.
Let's remember marketing ROI calculation:
mROI = (Sales revenue – Marketing Cost)/Marketing Cost
If your ad channels (Facebook, Google, TikTok Ads &amp; others) show the costs of the campaigns more or less instantly in the according ads managers, the actual conversions data takes days to be calculated for your ads.
That means that in order to get accurate ROI, you need close to rea-time cost and conversion data. RedTrack helps get this data in real-time, in a single interface.
You can choose different frequency for your cost updates:

 	30-minutes frequency: it's included in every paid RedTrack plan;
 	15-minutes frequency: available as a part of Automation+ package;
 	5-minutes frequency: available as a part of Automation++ package.

How to choose frequency for your campaigns' cost updates?
This is a common question from advertisers: ""What's the benefit of 15 or 5-min automation frequency over the standard 30-min option?"".

Here we can circle back to the value of your ad spend. The bigger your daily ad spend is, the more money you possibly might lose because your ad is not-performing.

9840,How Venture Beyond scaled Facebook ad spend over 4M with RedTrack: Agency Case Study,"Venture Beyond is an e-commerce growth agency helping DTC brands scale with media-buying. 
The agency's goal is to be a full-service growth partner for DTC Brands looking to scale up.
They help grow the revenue of e-commerce brands, primarily through Facebook Ads media-buying. Besides that, Venture Beyond does all of the creatives, including production, post-production, sourcing UGC, working with content creators, delivering content, CRO (conversion rate optimization), and also the growth strategy. 
Watch the full interview with Cem Verghese, COO, and co-founder at Venture Beyond.


Why did Venture Beyond need an analytics &amp; automation solution like RedTrack?
Venture Beyond was looking for a solution that would offer server-side tracking and accurate reports that would help them increase ad spend and revenue.
Also, just like everybody on the market, Venture Beyond was affected by iOS 14 update which caused disruptions in Facebook attribution: 

 	Facebook was showing delayed and modeled conversions;
 	There was no more reliability to make ad-level decisions;

RedTrack technology helped overcome iOS 14 limitations with real-time reports and hyper-accurate tracking.

Venture Beyond found in RedTrack all the necessary functionality: it was easy to use, and they could implement the solution for a reasonable price with no overage charge or % of the ad spend charge, like in other trackers. 
Which solutions did RedTrack offer? 
RedTrack offers a special type of account for advertising agencies that helps manage media-buying for multiple clients and control their performance from just one account. Learn more about RedTrack for ad agencies here.

 	Server-side tracking (Postback URL tracking)— RedTrack's technology ensures that every click and conversion is captured with no 3rd party cookies involved. We rely only on 1st party data that helps capture your performance with accuracy and precision. 
 	Reports — reporting with RedTrack helps you monitor the most valuable money-metrics for your business (CPA, CAC, revenue, ROI, ROAS), as well as understand the performance down to ad level and identify winners that make revenue for your business. RedTrack offers a variety of reports that you can customize to your needs and preferences, including Acquisition Dashboard (helping you analyze performance on campaign, ad group, and ad levels) and Conversion Path Report that helps seeing customer journey to conversion. 
 	Real-time data — unlike Facebook and Google's attribution modeling, which can take up to 7 days, with RedTrack, you can get real-time data and instantly understand what works and cut unnecessary ad waste. This gives you the ability to make decisions faster and scale your revenue.  
 	Conversion log — easily access all the data about your conversions to find discrepancies and analyze your performance more deeply.
 	Export data via API — if you want to visualize your data with extra solutions (like Tableau, Data Studio, and others), you can always export it via API with RedTrack.


Results after implementing a solution for ad agencies from RedTrack
Venture Beyond was able to:

 	Increase ad spent from $300k to $1.5mln on Facebook
 	Be able to identify winning creatives in real-time and scale instantaneously
 	Set up accounts for multiple clients to manage it as an agency
 	Add landing pages, offers, and traffic sources
 	Track all valuable metrics for the success of Venture Beyond clients
 	Monitor the engagement of the pre-sales


Why would Venture Beyond recommend RedTrack?
So why RedTrack is THE solution for advertising agencies?
1. Data accuracy with RedTrack 
RedTrack is an unbiased source of truth for your advertising. 

Unlike in Google Analytics, where the default attribution setting is last-click, with RedTrack, you can configure it on the first-click and expand your conversion window to 56 days.

2. Ability to choose your attribution setting with RedTrack
As Venture Beyond mainly uses Facebook for media-buying, it was of ultimate importance to use a first-click attribution setting (since Facebook Ads are usually the very first touchpoint on the way to conversion). 

After configuring their attribution setting to first-click, Venture Beyond were able to identify winning ad combinations in real-time without the bias of Facebook attribution modeling. 
3. RedTrack.io customer support excellence 
Besides the product itself, Venture Beyond noted the importance of the customer support team. RedTrack's support responds fast and is available on Skype for a call to configure everything and help set up a solution. 
""There is support from the team, including from Vlad Zhovtenko, the CEO of RedTrack, who will help you with technical issues and set everything up on a call with you. The trackers may be similar in their functionality but the accessible support is the most important because you might need help with the technical implementation on bespoke eCommerce platforms"".

9917,Track These 7 Metrics to Grow your E-commerce Business,"Looking to measure the success of your social media marketing efforts in growing your e-commerce business? This article breaks down the key social media metrics for e-commerce companies to track. 

For an e-commerce company, social media is a critical tool for building brand awareness, driving traffic, and ultimately, increasing sales. But in the race of creating content, one can lose sight of goals and judge if their efforts are adding value to the business or not. That's where social media content metrics come in.

In this article, we'll discuss the top social media content metrics that e-commerce companies should be tracking, what they mean, and how to use them to improve your social media strategy. 

From engagement rate and click-through rate to conversion rate and social media share of voice, these metrics can help e-commerce companies effectively analyze and optimize their social media content and campaigns. 

Additionally, the article delves into the method of calculating these key metrics for measuring the effectiveness of an influencer campaign, including Return on Ad Spend (ROAS), brand awareness, impressions/views, brand mentions/hashtag use, and clicks. By tracking these key metrics, e-commerce companies can gain valuable insights into their social media marketing efforts and make data-driven decisions to drive business growth. 
1. Engagement Rate
The engagement rate measures the level of interaction between your audience and your content. It includes likes, comments, shares, and saves. A high engagement rate means your audience is interested in your content and is more likely to buy from you.

To calculate your engagement rate, divide the total number of engagements by the total number of followers, and multiply by 100 to get a percentage. 

For example, if you have 10,000 followers and your content receives 1,000 likes, 100 comments, and 50 shares, your engagement rate would be:

((1,000 + 100 + 50) / 10,000) x 100 = 11%

It's important to note that the engagement rate can vary depending on the platform and the type of content you're posting. 

For example, Instagram tends to have higher engagement rates than Twitter, and videos often receive more engagement than static images.

To improve your engagement rate, focus on creating content that aligns with the interests of your target audience. Use elements of storytelling (a hook, conflict, and resolution). Try to use titles that create curiosity and resonate with your audience. This could include sharing user-generated content, asking questions, and responding to comments and messages in a timely manner.

2. Impressions

Impressions measure the number of times your content is seen. It's a helpful metric to track to gauge the overall reach of your content.

To calculate your impressions, simply add up the total number of times your content has been displayed. Keep in mind that impressions do not necessarily indicate that someone has engaged with your content, only that it has been seen.

Source                                 
To increase your impressions, define your ideal customer profile and focus on creating content that is visually appealing to your target group, informative, and shareable. Use hashtags and other strategies to make your content more discoverable, and consider running paid social media campaigns.
3. Click-Through Rate (CTR)
Click-through rate measures the number of clicks your content generates. It's an important metric to track because it shows how many people are interested enough in your content to visit your website.

To calculate your CTR, divide the total number of clicks by the total number of impressions (or views), and multiply by 100 to get a percentage. For example, if your content received 10,000 views and 500 clicks, your CTR would be:

(500 / 10,000) x 100 = 5%

A high CTR indicates that your content compels people to know more, and is effective in taking them to the next step. To improve your CTR, consider using strong calls-to-action, optimizing your content for the platform you're using, and opening up a loop at the end so people would like to know more by clicking on links. 
4. Conversion Rate
Conversion rate measures the percentage of people who complete a desired action, such as making a purchase or signing up for a newsletter, after clicking through your social media content. To calculate your conversion rate, divide the total number of conversions by the total number of clicks, and multiply by 100 to get a percentage.
For example, if your content received 500 clicks and 50 conversions (sales), your conversion rate would be:

(50 / 500) x 100 = 10%
 Source

To improve your conversion rate, make sure your landing pages are optimized for conversions and easy user onboarding, offer clear and compelling calls-to-action, and ensure that your product or service is aligned with your audience's needs and desires.


5. Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)
Return on ad spend measures the revenue generated from paid social media campaigns compared to the cost of those campaigns. This metric can help you determine whether your ad spend is delivering a positive return on investment (ROI).

To calculate your ROAS, divide the revenue generated from your paid social media campaigns by the cost of those campaigns. For example, if your campaigns generated $10,000 in revenue and you spent $1,000 on ads, your ROAS would be:

$10,000 / $1,000 = 10

A ROAS of 10 means that for every dollar you spent on ads, you generated $10 in revenue. To improve your ROAS, focus on targeting the right audience, using compelling ad creative, and continually optimizing your campaigns.

Since we now have a plethora of social media platforms, keeping a track of platform-wise returns is more important now than ever to maximize our efforts on the top-performing platforms and increase the returns. Tracking the customer’s inflow and attributing it to the right channel is the toughest part but once done it helps in cutting costs and scaling the ROI rapidly. 
6. Social Media Share of Voice (SOV)
Social media share of voice measures the percentage of conversations and mentions about your brand versus your competitors on social media. By tracking your SOV, you can understand how your brand, as well as your logo design, a key component of your brand, is perceived in the market and how you stack up against your competitors.


Source

To calculate your SOV, divide the number of mentions and conversations about your brand by the joint total number of mentions and conversations about your brand and your competitors, and multiply by 100 to get a percentage. 

For example, if there were 100 conversations about your brand and your competitors on social media, and 60 of those conversations were about your brand, your SOV would be:

(60 / 100) x 100 = 60%

A higher SOV generally indicates that your brand is more top-of-mind and more visible than your competitors. To improve your SOV, focus on creating engaging and shareable content that encourages your audience to talk about your brand on social media.
7. Social Media Referral Traffic
Social media referral traffic measures the number of website visits that come from social media platforms. This metric can help you determine which social media channels are driving the most traffic to your website.

To track your social media referral traffic, use Google Analytics or another website analytics tool to monitor the source of your website traffic. You can also use UTM codes to track the performance of specific social media campaigns or posts.

To increase your social media referral traffic, focus on creating content that is tailored to each social media platform and encourages users to click through to your website. Use trackable links and calls-to-action to make it easy for users to visit your website.
Final thoughts
By tracking these social media content metrics, e-commerce companies can gain valuable insights into the effectiveness of their social media strategy and make data-driven decisions to improve their performance. 

Make sure to regularly review and analyze your metrics, test new content and strategies, and stay up-to-date on the latest social media trends and best practices. Keep an eye on other growing industries’ strategies. 

With the right approach, social media can be a powerful tool for driving growth and increasing revenue for your e-commerce business. If facing issues in figuring out the right social media platform and tracking conversion rate, try Redtrack's free trial to grow your business.

9948,How To Find Products To Sell In E-Commerce,"In the world of e-commerce, finding the right products to sell can make or break your business.

 Identifying products with high demand, profitable margins, and a unique selling proposition can be challenging. And today our friends and patterns at Minea will help explore the world of finding best products in e-commerce. 

This is where Minea, the best ads spy tool, comes in handy. By analyzing competitor ads and identifying winning products, Minea can help you find the perfect product to sell in your e-commerce store. 

In this article, we will provide a comprehensive guide on finding products to sell in e-commerce, with a special focus on using Minea to identify and evaluate winning products. Whether you're just starting out or looking to scale your business, this article will provide you with the knowledge and tools to succeed in the competitive world of e-commerce.
Conducting Market Research
There are several methods of finding a winning product in ecommerce. But no matter which method you want to use, it is important for you to take the time to do a little market analysis. This will give you an orientation on where you should start your product research.

This market analysis mainly goes through 3 steps.
1. Identifying market trends and gaps
Identifying market trends and gaps can help you understand what products are currently in demand and where there may be an opportunity for your business. This can involve analyzing search data, reviewing industry reports, and monitoring social media conversations.  A web scraping API can automate the collection of this valuable data from multiple sources.
2. Analyzing customer needs and preferences
Analyzing customer needs and preferences is critical in identifying products that will resonate with your target audience. This involves identifying pain points, desires, and preferences of your target audience. You can do this by conducting surveys, focus groups, and reviewing customer feedback on products in your niche.
3. Studying competitor products and pricing
Studying competitor products and pricing can help you identify successful products in your niche and evaluate their potential profitability. This can involve analyzing product features, pricing, and customer reviews.

The best way to perform these different analyses is to use a product search tool like Minea which will allow you to analyze all the parameters of a product on the market.

Here is how you can use Minea to find your winning product in e-commerce quickly.
Minea: the best e-commerce product search tool

What is Minea?
Minea is the most used and most complete tool for spying on social network ads. It is the place to find your winning e-commerce or drop shipping product.

Minea spies daily on the most active social networks used by e-merchants and drop shippers to collect all the advertisements. As you know, the best way to succeed in a business is to see what your competitors are already doing.

Basically, Minea allows you to be inspired by what is already working on the market in order to replicate it in your e-commerce store.
What are the features of Minea?
For your dropshipping winning product search, the first tool or feature of Minea that you will use is its product search tool.  Since Minea spies on several social networks, Minea's product search tool is subdivided into several parts.

You have:

 	A product search tool for Facebook and Instagram;
 	A product search tool for TikTok;
 	A product search tool for Pinterest.

Depending on the type of product you want, you're going to gravitate toward one of these tools. Note that the functionalities are the same for each tool. It is a kind of database in which you will have all the advertisements that are broadcast on each of the social networks.



To facilitate the product search for its users, Minea offers filters that allow you to optimize your search according to your preferences.  You can search by:

 	Keyword;
 	Domain name;
 	Date of publication, date of view;
 	Country;
 	Language;
 	Number of Likes, shares, comments;
 	Type of e-commerce platform;
 	Number of downloads;
 	Number of views.

After your search, Minea also allows you to further analyze the trend of a product by providing you with important information regarding the performance of this product on social networks.



So, for each ad you find in the Minea library, you can have information like:

 	The duration of the ad online;
 	The social engagement of the ad (Views, Likes, Shares, Downloads, Shares...);
 	Other ads from the same store;
 	The complete analysis of the store;
 	Target audience;
 	The link to the store.

This product information will confirm or deny the potential of your product.

Besides the product search tool, Minea also offers several other equally useful features. For example, you have the store spy tool that allows you to spy on your competitors' stores and the influencer marketing spy tool that allows you to spy on all product placements made by your competitors.

Don't hesitate to test Minea for free to find your first winning products in e-commerce.
What to do after finding the winning product?
Once you have identified potential products to sell, it's important to test their performance before investing too much time and resources into them. Testing product performance can involve conducting market tests and surveys, evaluating customer feedback and product reviews, and adjusting product features and pricing as needed.

Market tests can help you understand how well a product is likely to perform in the market. You can conduct market tests by launching a small-scale advertising campaign or selling the product in a limited capacity to a specific group of customers.

 This can help you understand how well the product is received and identify any issues with pricing, marketing messaging, or product features.

Finally, Customer feedback and product reviews are also critical in evaluating product performance. This can involve reviewing customer feedback on your own website, as well as third-party sites like Amazon or social media. By understanding what customers are saying about your product, you can identify areas for improvement and adjust your marketing messaging as needed.

It can be quite difficult to do all this manually. It can take quite a lot of time and financial investment. To avoid this, Minea offers you its Business Plan, thanks to which you will only have products that are already working on the market.

This means that with these products, you will no longer have to perform testing to identify the performance of the product on the market. These are products that are chosen by highly developed artificial intelligence based on several criteria. This is the best way to find the best products on the market.
Advertise your winning products through various marketing channels
When you already settled best products to sell, it's time for some heavy advertisement. This step will ensure the more people will be able to discover your offer, and scale your revenue from this business.

However, if you start advertising, don't forget to invest in software that will do analytics of your ads. RedTrack offers an all-in-one analytics &amp; automation platform for advertisers who want to create an ultimate $-efficiency for their ad spend vs. returns. With RedTrac you can:

 	integrate all of your marketing channels &amp; tools in one place;
 	analytics every single campaign, ad group or ad set according to the KPIs you set;
 	automate performance with AI Rules!

Conclusion
In conclusion, finding the right products to sell in e-commerce requires careful research and evaluation. By conducting market research, evaluating product viability, choosing a product niche, finding product suppliers, and testing product performance, you can identify winning products that will resonate with your target audience and drive sales. Utilizing tools like Minea can help you streamline this process and gain valuable insights into competitor ads and winning products in your niche.

As you embark on your e-commerce journey, remember that success takes time and effort. Don't be afraid to iterate and adjust your strategy as you learn more about your customers and the market. By taking a data-driven approach and utilizing tools like Minea, you can stay ahead of the competition and build a successful e-commerce business.",5/15/2023,https://redtrack.io/blog/how-to-find-products-to-sell-in-e-commerce/,digital marketing|eCommerce
9961,iOS 17: everything you need to know as an advertiser,"Step-by-step the world of advertising is turning into a privacy-compliant industry. At RedTrack, we have seen all of the life-changing events for advertisers and marketers, like:
- Block of third-party cookies by major browsers;
- Introduction of iOS 14 and its ATT prompt;
- Slow death of Universal Google Analytics. 
I want to believe that if you have followed our content in previous years, you are not so scared of iOS 17 and its privacy changes. But if you still are confused about what iOS 17 means for advertisers, let’s figure it out together. 
iOS 17 — another step of Apple to limit advertisers’ access to users’ data
What is important in iOS 17 for advertisers and marketers is its focus on privacy in Safari Private mode. But what it really means?
In a nutshell, it means that Apple is aiming to make Private mode as private as possible and block even the most advanced tracking technologies used by marketers to track users' activity. Besides, tracking limitations will also influence links in iMessage and Mail.

The list of privacy changes coming with iOS 17 includes: 

 	Blocking fingerprinting and known trackers;
 	Blocking trackers that map subdomains and various IP-addresses;
 	Blocking tracking parameters included in links used by marketers to identify personal data. When it comes to directional data (like campaign, ad set, ad), it’s not going to be affected as it is not considered to be personal information;  
 	Blocking trackers that use CNAME cloaking; 
 	Blocking availability to track FB (Meta Ads) and Google Ads by removing so-called gclid and fbclid which are considered to be unique personal identifiers (meaning not allowed by this privacy regulation). 

And instead introducing Private Click Measurement support to help marketers out in their job.

Before panicking, I would really encourage you to check how much of your traffic takes Safari and specifically Safari Private mode. 

According to statistics, 62% of users use Google Chrome, and only 20% use Safari (even less - Private mode). 

Therefore, only a small amount of advertising traffic is going to be affected by this update. 
Can you still track your performance with Google Analytics after iOS 17? 
Tracking with iOS 17 is going to be quite hard using Google Analytics since Google’s unique click ID (gclid) is going to be automatically removed.

It is a way safer alternative to work with a designated tracking &amp; attribution solution that will use more exquisite tracking technologies to attribute your sales correctly. 
What stays unaffected after iOS 17?
Despite all the disputes, Apple did not announce any of those measures for regular browsing mode in Safari. 

Also, even with iOS 17, you can still use custom tracking parameters like we do at RedTrack. It would be quite complicated for Apple to block the usage of custom tracking parameters, but we are going to observe what happens and react accordingly. 

In general, even if Apple starts blocking RedTrack’s IP addresses and subdomains, there is left an option to integrate Private Click Measurement and stay compliant. 
A different question is — will Apple introduce the same measures with time for Safari in general? 
Probably yes, but we can not know for sure right now if it’s going to happen and how soon it’s going to happen. 
What we know with certainty from the experience of privacy updates from Facebook, Apple, Google, and the rest — is that it TAKES TIME to implement such severe limitations. 

We should never forget something we repeat in our content at RedTrack. All of those companies, like Google, Facebook, Apple, depend on the revenue that marketers generate, so whenever new updates are introduced, some alternatives and solutions are also offered. 

The greatest example here is Google and it’s the removal of Universal Google Analytics, which literally took almost 3 years to actually implement. We, as always, recommend to stay calm and get back to the tracking solution you trust for help and advice.
Is RedTrack threatened by iOS 17? 
It is a very clear no. 
We expect these changes to go smoothly. And we have a plan A, B, and C, considering even the worst-case scenario. 

In the past 5 years, we have shown how flexible and agile we are as a company, introducing the following features as pioneers:
- Using only first-party data for tracking; 
- Facebook tracking after the introduction of iOS 14; 

- Have developed everything you need to substitute Universal Google Analytics (most of our clients never had to worry about GA’s sunset). 


We have smooth integration with Facebook (Meta), Google, TikTok, and other ad channels and networks. Now we devote our dev team’s time to developing a centralized center for your ads when it comes to tracking, accurate attribution, and analytics. 

Expect even more cool features that will put your performance on auto-pilot without ever having to worry about privacy concerns and do not worry about iOS 17.

9970,5 ways to automate your campaigns: Overview of Advanced Automation by RedTrack,"2022 was the year of amazing features here at RedTrack. But ofc, the release of our Advanced Automation has absolutely stolen the show. It's THE solution for automation, scaling, and reduction of tedious and manual media-buying jobs.
So today, let's go over all the possibilities to scale your revenue in 2023 with the use of the Automation toolset by RedTrack. In this article, we will talk about:

 	What are cost updates, and how can help cut ad waste, as well as scale ROI;
 	Use cases of Automated Rules by RedTrack;
 	How to use automation by RedTrack;
 	And 5 examples of Ruled you can apply now!

Let's start this year with crazy profits together with RedTrack!
What is Advanced Automation By RedTrack?
We have implemented a new segment of the RedTrack platform — Advanced Automation. It is meant to cut your manual work with the use of our algorithms and give your the opportunity to focus on creating more.
While RedTrack will be cutting non-performing ads, scaling the best ones, or scheduling ads upon your needs.

There are various types of Rules we are implementing to the platform:
Pause &amp; Restart Rules
This set of Rules is here for you to test your strategies! You can easily pause campaigns, ad sets, or ads that are underperforming in a certain span of time. 

If you choose Pause &amp; Restart Rule action, your campaigns will also automatically reactivate if additional conversion data has been received and the KPI is met!
Scale Rules
This set is here for you to scale revenue. You can change budgets, bids, or duplicate ads that bring the biggest profits. 

You can also use this rule in reverse and decrease the budget if the campaign is losing its traffic.
Manual campaign management
This one is for all of you, marketers, who are tired of jumping between the tabs, but still want more manual control over your campaigns. If you notice some issues with one your Facebook campaigns, you can pause it directly from the RedTrack interface! 

This Rule currently works just for Facebook, but TikTok and other platforms are coming soon! 
Schedule Rules (coming later in 2023)
And a special rule to help you schedule your ads ahead of time, or to run them to run only at a certain time of the day! Will be released later in 2023.
Campaigns' Cost Updates: Why is it so important for advertising automation?
Costs are important for several reasons:

 	It's important to have data about all of the costs of your paid campaigns in one place so you can track how much you spend in total. You will also be able to track each ad channel, campaign, and ad set efficiency in a centralized way without a need to create reports via third-party solutions or jump between the tabs of Ads Managers.
 	It's the most crucial value that your ad tracking solution should be pulling to calculate returns: ROI and ROAS
 	And finally, the costs of the campaigns is probably the most important variable for the automation of your paid campaigns.

How can you receive cost updates for your campaign?
For that, your tracker or analytics solution is required to have an API-based integration with the needed channel. 
For example, RedTrack can receive cost updates via API integration with these channels (and still counting): Facebook Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads, Revcontent, Bing Ads, Exoclick, Outbrain, Richpush, Taboola, Traffic Junky, Zeropark, etc. 
Importance of cost updates for advertisers
How do you know which campaigns or ads bring your dollars back as ROI? Here the cost update feature comes really handy. Without consistent cost updates, we don't know the actual and timely ROI of every campaign, ad set, or ad.
Let's remember the marketing ROI calculation:
mROI = (Sales revenue – Marketing Cost)/Marketing Cost
If your ad channels (Facebook, Google, TikTok Ads &amp; others) show the costs of the campaigns more or less instantly in the according ads managers, the actual conversions data takes days to be calculated for your ads.
That means that in order to get accurate ROI, you need close to real-time cost and conversion data. RedTrack helps get this data in real-time, in a single interface.

Whether you are automating your performance with Rules or not, cost updates is still a crucial number to take charge of. To understand that, we need to make a simple example.
Let's think of the number you spend on ads a month.

Let's say it's $100k of ad spend each month.

That means that every day you spend approximately $3500. It’s $150 per hour. It means that every single hour you can either take this $150 and turn into revenue, or just spend it = waste it. With timely cost updates, you can make decisions about stopping certain campaigns or scaling if it’s needed on the spot. 

And without timely updates, you might be losing ad budget and now even realizing it. 

Attribution on Facebook / Google / TikTok takes up to 72 hours (or up to $450 of your budget in uncertainty). 

While RedTrack offers 30-min updates by default, and you can customize it to 15 or 5-min costs &amp; rules updates. That means that at least every 30-min we help you either to cut ad waste or to scale best-performing ads! 

If you want real revenue, delays are the worst enemy of the media buyer. With RedTrack, you can forget about late decisions!
How to choose the frequency of your campaigns' cost updates?
This is a common question from advertisers: ""What's the benefit of 15 or 5-min automation frequency over the standard 30-min option?"".

Here we can circle back to the value of your ad spend. The bigger your daily ad spend is, the more money you possibly might lose because your ad is not-performing. Or the more revenue you can get because the algorithm finds a rocking ad instantly and scales it. 

Generally, we recommend for those with more than $10,000 daily ad spend to invest at least in 15-min frequency for cost updates and automated rules. 

And for those with over $50,000 daily ad spend — a 5-min frequency would be a must.
How to use Automated Rules by RedTrack
Let’s start with a general understanding about setting up automated rules with the use of RedTrack. As for now, you can automate Facebook (Meta) Ads, TikTok Ads, and Google Ads, even though we are working on increasing the list of channels you can automate. 

When you want to set up a rule in RedTrack, you need to set up a campaign within RedTrack. 

A single campaign in RedTrack can help you automate either a corresponding campaign in Facebook / Google / TikTok or you can automate multiple campaigns at once. You can also choose to automate all existing campaigns in RedTrack and the rules will apply to everything we have in RT. 
Depth of Rules in RedTrack 
The rules you set up in RedTrack will help you automate your ads either on the campaign level, either on the ad set level, or even on the creative / ad level. This gives plenty of space for experiments and even more precise optimization of your campaigns. 
KPIs you can use with RedTrack’s Automation
Another important part of Automation Extension by RedTrack is flexibility and the variety of metrics you can use to set up KPIs for automation. 
RedTrack supports a custom metrics model — meaning you can invent any KPIs you want. Here’s a list of some of the most common metrics you can optimize with:

 	Clicks;
 	Conversions;
 	Costs;
 	ROI;
 	ROAS;
 	CPA;
 	Price per page visit;
 	All conversions (total actions); 
 	Sign-ups;
 	Add-to-carts;
 	Subscriptions;
 	Upgrades;
 	Downgrades;
 	Leads;

When you find the rights metrics and events to use for optimization, you can put them into a simple equation for automation! We will have more automation scenarios with examples below in this article. 

Another cool addition, you can set multiple conditions for a single rule for better optimization. Basically, you can go as deep as you want in the process of automation to decipher your best-performing offers. 
Use cases of automation by RedTrack 
Since RedTrack combines a tracking &amp; analytics platform with an automation toolset, you can use RedTrack as a single control center for your ads. 
Our hyper-accurate tracking will ensure the collection of real-time data about the performance of all your campaigns across various channels. As a result, you will have all the most important data sets under one roof. 

And as the next step, you can optimize your performance according to the data RedTrack collected on the same platform.  RedTrack becomes a software that helps you: 

 	Test your creatives: simply set KPIs to test your ads during the first 3 days after the launch to help you sort out winning creatives. 
 	Control costs spike: you can be notified when one of your campaigns or creatives rises in costs to not waste any ad budget! 
 	Optimize your campaigns instantly without the delays of sending reports to another solution that could use it for automation. 
 	Manual campaign management from RedTrack interface: and one more step towards eliminating jumping between the tabs! If you invest in automation by RedTrack, you can also pause or resume your FB / TikTok campaigns straight from RT interface!

5 Automated Rules to use in your next campaign
And now let’s look at the favorite Rules combinations our clients love to use in reality! We will include screenshots from the interface for your convenience! 
1. Pause ad if X$ spent and below X ROAS  
Probably the easiest way to eliminate ad waste is to pause ads that don’t bring the right ROAS. When it comes to understanding what numbers to use for this Rule, you have to rely on your business figures. 

What we would recommend is the following: 

Pause the ad if $500 spent and ROAS is &lt; 200%. 
Take a look at how it works from RedTrack!

2. If ROI &gt;X%, increase budget X times
This is an example of one of our scale rules: you can easily scale the budget for the best-performing campaign to increase returns! 

Again a recommendation from us would be: If ROI &gt; 400%, increase the budget by 50%. 

Don’t forget that whenever a certain rule is triggered and applied, you can also receive notifications about all the actions: simply choose your notification option during the rule setup.


3. If CPA is &gt;X, pause the ad
This example also works perfectly for cases of testing new campaigns. Your ads will be paused if they don’t reach a certain CPA KPI. 

Keep in mind, that if you choose as an action not just Pause, but Pause &amp; Restart rule, your campaigns can be reactivated if additional conversions appear and improve the CPA metric! 
4. If ROAS is &lt;X%, decrease the budget X times
And sometimes, you need to save your budget. With RedTrack you can easily do so with a custom rule. This functionality allows you to do bidding for your campaigns within RedTrack interface!
5. Send an email (notification) if costs are &gt; X$
And last but not least, it’s nice to stay updated about the status of your campaigns. You can set the most important spikes (like increases in costs, or decrease in the number of conversions) in a notification! It can be sent to your email, or via the webhook you set!


Final words
We hope that this article brought a bit more clarity to the world of automation. Please, be sure to stay ahead of your competition and optimize with the use of the latest technologies. In our field, it’s extremely important to make every dollar count! 

If you need a tool to help you figure out automation, be sure to book a demo with RedTrack to see how we can help you scale your ROI!

We wouldn’t call summer a dead season for the whole affiliate marketing — it isn’t really; there are always evergreen niches. However, the sports betting vertical does experience some, let’s call it, slack period until August — there are almost no significant events, with several exceptions.

So, autumn becomes a game changer: all the biggest sports leagues begin their seasons — and sports offers will start gaining traction again. 

If we are speaking about exactly this fall, here is what we are expecting:





 	August: Start of 2023-2024 regular season in EPL, Bundesliga, La Liga, Serie A
 	September 30: AFL Grand Final
 	October 1: Rugby League NRL Grand Final
 	October 5 - November 19: Cricket ODI World Cup
 	September 7: Start of 2023-24 NFL regular season
 	September 29: Start of 2023-24 MLB regular season
 	October 10: Start of 2023-24 NHL regular season
 	October 24: Start of 2023-24 NBA regular season





Special insight from PropellerAds:

What is also great about sports offers is that they are not limited by standard iGaming sites. Besides, there are plenty of affiliate programs available in the Fantasy Sports market — which is, by the way, forecast to increase by $9.84 billion by the end of 2023 in the USA.
A short note: fantasy sports is a game where you create a virtual team consisting of real players. The performance of these players on the real field brings their virtual twinks — your team members — a certain number of points.
Here is a flash of one Fantasy Sports case study we got from our partner:



Offer: Fantasy Sports App for US

Campaign Period: NFL season 2023

Traffic Type: PropellerAds Popunder

Platform: iOS

Results: more than 2 million relevant users and more than $7,000 in monthly revenue



So, seems it’s worth trying, right?

And, finally, sports always come along with iGaming — so you will most likely profit if you include a couple of casino offers in your advertising plan.

Extra: Example of creatives!


Trend 2: Utility Apps Offers
Utilities can be called an evergreen vertical. However, some of them have slight seasonality, too — for example, VPNs often go in step with iGaming. Thus, we can safely predict that autumn will bring an additional boost to VPN app offers, too — and might become a nice addition to your iGaming campaigns. 

Besides, as Max Stan, ZeyDoo Senior Marketing Manager, puts it:
""Cleaners will also be growing in 2023 — so it’s highly recommended to start testing them right now or later in autumn — the summer period might have some drop-off in conversions, while conversions tend to grow in September and later. For example, last autumn showed 9% more conversions related to summer campaigns for Utility apps.""

Special insight from PropellerAds:

Thanks to Max, we can also show you some great offers to try out:





 	Jax VPN
 	Fast n Clean
 	AdBlock
 	Scanero - QR code scanner





Extra: Creatives example


Trend 3: eCommerce Offers 
Yes, we know that was pretty obvious — but eCommerce is one of the few verticals with clear seasonality. Not that marketplaces sell worse during summer — but the whole eCommerce niche, including its advertising part, depends on the sales periods. 

Autumn is a fruitful time for sales — and we recommend you think broader. Black Friday and Cyber Monday ARE great for your profits — but local holidays are also a lucrative thing! 
Here is a ready list of the biggest shopping events you should keep in mind this autumn:





 	October 31: Halloween (WW)
 	November 12: Singles’ Day (Southeast Asia)
 	November 17-20: El Buen Fin (Mexico)
 	November 21: Big Steam Sales (WW)
 	November 23: Thanksgiving Day (USA)
 	November 24: Black Friday (WW)
 	November 27: CyberMonday (WW)





Besides, you can find a certain advantage in the so-called ‘back-to-school’ and ‘back-to-college’ market. As you might guess, it’s related to special sales of study supplies, electronics, and school clothes. Don’t underestimate these trending products for affiliate marketing— only in America, there is an average of $257 spending per household on school clothing and accessories planned for 2023.

Special insight from PropellerAds:

All shopping events also make a perfect match with the Sweepstakes vertical. For example, here is a case study of one of our partners who ran a Sweeps offer during El Buen Fin last year:





 	Campaign period: Nov 15, 2022 – Nov 23, 2022
 	GEO: MX
 	Traffic type: PropellerAds Popunder
 	Leads: 4216
 	Profit: $1959.88
 	ROI: 50,47%





The offer’s flow was very simple: a pretty standard landing page in Spanish, two campaigns targeting Desktop and Mobile traffic, and extra monetization tools: ProPush tag and Backbutton. Later, our partner added one more campaign, separating Android users — and the final results were the following:

Trend 4: Finance Apps Offers 
No, we don’t mean finance apps will suddenly become super-trendy this autumn. They already are — for example, Indian market statistics show that banking, payment, and personal finance apps grow by 28% from year to year.

So, this affiliate marketing trend is definitely here to stay — why not try it during the fruitful period when all budgets are rising? 

The Finance app vertical includes many app types — digital wallets, mobile banking, insurance, quick loans, and more. However, many affiliate marketers find their golden mines in trading and crypto trading offers. And, of course, such offers become growing affiliate marketing trends when the Bitcoin market cap passes another significant number. 
As some crypto experts predict, Bitcoin’s ROI will reach 20% this November — and if so, this will be another good sign to run traffic on some trading simulator or Bitcoin wallet.
Special insight from PropellerAds:

By the way, one of our partners shared his trading app campaign statistics for last autumn — which was pretty impressive! Here are some insights about his campaign you might want to use in yours:





 	Offer: A trading platform app
 	Conversion type: Cost-Per-Lead
 	Period: Autumn 2022
 	Ad format: PropellerAds Popunder
 	Bidding model: CPA Goal, SmartCPC
 	Optimization: Conversion tracking, whitelists for the most converting zones





And the results:

10008,Customer Journey Analytics for E-commerce 101,"In the rapidly evolving landscape of e-commerce, understanding and optimizing your customer's journey is vital for success. To navigate this complex terrain, you need a powerful tool to create customer journey reports. What is a simple set of conversion events packed in an excellent report is a complex technology enabled by first-party data and exquisite tracking technologies. 

RedTrack is one of the leading platforms that transforms a vast data set into clear, customizable performance reports that you can easily act on and optimize your campaigns. 

One of the latest additions to RedTrack platform is Customer Journey reporting for e-commerce. 

Before we discuss why this update is so important for all the e-commerce and DTC stores out there, let's talk about the meaning and significance of the customer journey for performance marketers and businesses' success in general. 
What is customer journey analytics? 
With the help of a customer journey, you can map a ""path"" that a particular user took before making a purchase. It's a network of multiple ad clicks, ad channels, and touchpoints unifying the customer journey before the sale. 
Customer journey is a set of touchpoints your customer had with your product / website / or specifically your advertising. 
Why is customer journey reporting so important for e-commerce marketers? 
Well, every business's marketing team would benefit from ""walking the way"" hand in hand with your customers. It creates a deeper understanding of how your marketing activities are interacted with and what kind of effect they have on your KPIs. 
E-commerce business is one of the top niches where tracking every single interaction with the ads is important because of the multitouch nature of the marketing campaigns. 
Usual e-commerce businesses work with various paid ad channels (like Meta, Google, TikTok), influencers, email marketing, content marketing, affiliate marketing for e-com, etc. All these channels require a unique approach when working on analytics of its performance. 

Especially when it comes to emails, companies should also set up DMARC to ensure proper email security, and to provide seamless email experience.

Moreover, the costs of the campaigns (especially if we are talking about paid channels) are permanently rising. 

Increasing campaign budgets mean that achieving increasing ROAS is a must. And only with accurate click and conversion data customer journey reports are possible. 
Performance &amp; customer journey analytics become a top priority for e-com marketers who want to increase the profitability of their campaigns, decrease CAC, and optimize performance based on accurate data, not just guesses and intuition. 
4 Use Cases of Customer Journey Analytics boosting revenue for e-com
Let's look over 4 most common examples of how Customer Journey Analytics can help your e-commerce or DTC business thrive.


Full funnel visibility with customer journey reports
With the help of customer journeys, e-commerce business gets unbeatable clarity in the user's interaction with the store's ads and campaigns. 

You will see every click from various channels and how they all line up in a sequence of events that lead to the purchase. 

The best part is that you can analyze it on the user level.

As an e-com media buyer or business owner, you can analyze every single purchase or build a more advanced report, where you will be able to dig deeper into conversion reasons. 
You can analyze your customer journey by specific channel (whether it's Fb Ads, TikTok Ads, or Google Ads) and campaign and understand what truly impacts your marketing strategy. 
Optimization, customization, and personalization
Knowing the real picture of the conversion journey customers take, you can get into optimization of your campaigns. 

With RedTrack's all-in-one platform for e-commerce, you can optimize your campaigns in a few ways: 
- Utilize Rules to automate performance-based campaigns 
You can set up automation flows with Advanced Rules that will stop non-performing ads or campaigns or scale budgets / bids for campaigns that bring you the most revenue. 
- Strategize your campaigns with full knowledge of the funnel 
Advertisers often make significant decisions about the campaign's fate or even channel profitability based on mere assumptions and guesses. With RedTrack conversion data and customer journey reports, you can make your decisions data-informed and be confident in your changes for a higher ROAS. 
Efficient budget allocation in e-commerce
When analyzing the performance of each channel in various reports (including customer journey reports), you can make conscious decisions about the financial investments and budgets that have to be distributed across all ad campaigns. 
Attribution Clarity in multichannel e-commerce marketing world 
Building your ad strategy is only possible with accurate attribution. Relying on Meta Ads Manager or Google Analytics is a sure way to make inaccurate decisions since those networks are considered to be self-attribution platforms. 

Learn more about Facebook attribution model here &gt;&gt;&gt;

In a nutshell, the main problem when working with tools from Meta, Google, or TikTok is using data modelling, and does not give you the real picture behind every single conversion. It's more of an approximation of your performance. 

And let us remind you that attributing those conversions to the ads takes up to 72 hours.

Therefore, it would be a big mistake for any e-commerce media-buyer to trust Google Analytics, even the later Google Analytics 4.

RedTrack opens your e-com business a world of attribution clarity and confidence.
How RedTrack helps e-commerce advertisers track customer journeys?

10019,The Best Ecommerce Integrations: Toolkit for your e-store,"Running an e-commerce business is trendy today. But is it easy? Well, despite what every online guru might tell you, running e-businesses can be as challenging as it can get. So, optimizing processes and workflow should be a top priority for anyone starting (or continuing :) online stores.
Automation and optimization of e-commerce is impossible without integrations with marketing, shipping, fulfillment, and other solutions.
Therefore, we dedicate this integration guide to you, e-com store owner, to help you fight mundane routine tasks and automate your business early on. This guide focuses on marketing automation simply because it's our mission at RedTrack to make your advertising efforts more efficient, saving you time and scaling your revenue.
What are E-commerce Integrations?
E-commerce integrations are the connectors, or let's say bridges, that link various aspects of your online store to streamline operations and improve functionality.
They allow you to synchronize different tools and services you use in your e-commerce business, making them work in harmony together. Whether you're managing your website, inventory, customer relations, or marketing efforts, integrations can make the entire process smoother and more efficient.

Depending on which tools you use, you can integrate them with your e-com platform of choice (like Shopify, WooCommerce, Magento, etc.) to align various activities in a single place.
Why e-stores need e-commerce integrations
The need for e-commerce integrations cannot be overstated. Here's why they are essential for online businesses:



 	Improved Efficiency: Integrations automate tasks that would otherwise be time-consuming and error-prone, allowing you to focus on more critical aspects of your business.
 	Data Accuracy: Integrations reduce the risk of data discrepancies and manual errors by synchronizing data across platforms.
 	Enhanced Customer Experience: A seamless integration between your store and customer relationship management tools helps you provide a better shopping experience, leading to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.
 	Real-time Insights: Integrations often provide real-time data and analytics, enabling you to make informed decisions and adapt to changing market trends.
 	Competitive Advantage: In a highly competitive online market, efficient integrations can give you an edge, allowing you to offer superior services, optimize pricing, and manage inventory effectively.

Challenges and Obstacles of Implementation for Ecommerce Owners
While ecommerce integrations offer a bunch of benefits, their implementation is not without its challenges:

 	API access: Integrating different tools and systems can be complex, especially if they weren't initially designed to work together. Compatibility issues can lead to unexpected technical difficulties. In order for integrations to work successfully, you need to have a strong development team who can understand API access and connect platforms on that back-end.
 	Cost Considerations: Sometimes, setting up integration can be quite costly. Therefore, as a small or medium business owner, you should consider going for solutions that provide easy templated integrations with your e-com platform (choosing Shopify or WooCommerce is always the best way to ensure you have plenty of solutions to integrate it with). 
 	Security Concerns: Ensure how trustworthy the tool you are integrating with is, to avoid the risk of putting your business security at risk. 
 	Training and Adaptation: Your team might need some time to adapt to the new working process. When choosing your e-commerce integrations, it's best to give your favor to the tools that have helpful guidelines, articles, and videos that can assist in fighting the learning curve. 

Top e-commerce integrations toolset
For e-commerce owners starting their integration journey, here's a basic kit of integrations to consider:
1. Reliable payment gateway for e-stores
Choose a reliable payment gateway like PayPal, Stripe, or Square to ensure smooth and secure transactions. Finances are one of the niches where you have to look out for top security since your customers will use their bank details to complete orders. If your payment window looks shady — it can affect the success of your business.
2. Inventory Management / Fulfillment tools to keep track of your retail stock
Implement an inventory management integration to keep track of your stock and prevent overselling. Some of the best tools out there are:

 	ShipBob — From memorable unboxing experiences to faster shipping, ShipBob provides best-in-class supply chain solutions and fulfills global orders from the US, UK, EU, Canada, and Australia.
 	inFlow — track inventory and orders, reorder ahead of time to prevent limited stock or overselling, fulfill everything from your phone!
 	Linnworks —  from inventory and warehouse management through to order fulfillment and reporting – from a single, centralized platform.

3. CRMs for e-commerce business
A customer relationship management system (CRM) is essential to e-commerce business growth and development. CRM will help you organize your customer data, nurture relationships with your customers, personalize messages for various groups, and many other benefits. Most commonly recommended CRMs for e-commerce are:

 	Zoho —  robust automation, comprehensive analytics, personalized solutions, and more.
 	Salesforce — create seamless, personalized customer experiences everywhere, from shopping, to fulfillment, to customer service and beyond.
 	Nutshell — Provide an excellent customer experience that makes loyal and new customers happy with easy-to-use customer relationship management (CRM) software like Nutshell.


E-commerce marketing integrations
One of the top categories of integrations is marketing and advertising tools. Since e-commerce businesses depend highly on marketing and advertising strategy success, integrating your marketing stack is one of the first priorities when optimizing your business' performance. Here we are gonna cover several categories of marketing tools: from social media management to analytics &amp; automation!
Analytics &amp; Automation for e-commerce
Every e-com store runs paid ads to achieve its business goals. Once your ad budget goes out of $10k a month, you should consider integrating an analytics &amp; automation solution for your ads. It will help keep track of your campaigns, identify the most profitable ones, and cut the costs on the ads that don't bring you nice returns!

This is essential for creating integrated marketing strategies that cater to your audience's multi-channel browsing habits.

10132,Ultimate Guide: How To Do Media Buying And Affiliate Marketing With Google,"In the digital advertising world, Google stands as a towering presence, offering unparalleled opportunities for media buyers and affiliate marketers. With its vast user base and sophisticated tools, Google provides a rich platform for targeted advertising and successful affiliate marketing campaigns. This article explores how media buyers and affiliate marketers can leverage Google's extensive capabilities to bolster their digital strategies and achieve remarkable results.
Google for Media Buyers
Google's dominance in the digital space offers a plethora of benefits for media buyers and affiliate marketers:



 	Vast User Base: Google's extensive reach across various demographics makes it an ideal platform for a wide range of product categories.
 	Advanced Targeting and Tools: Google Ads offers sophisticated targeting options, including remarketing and interest-based targeting, crucial for precise audience segmentation.
 	Integration with Google Services: Google’s ecosystem, including YouTube and Google Shopping, provides a comprehensive environment for diverse advertising strategies.
 	Variety of Ad Formats: Google supports numerous ad formats, from search ads to display and video ads, meeting various marketing requirements.
 	Detailed Analytics: Google's analytics tools are robust and insightful, offering deep dives into campaign performance and audience behavior.

Leveraging Google for Affiliate Marketing: A Closer Look
Google's ecosystem offers a fertile ground for affiliate marketers, rich with opportunities for targeted campaigns and high engagement. Let's dive deeper into each aspect of leveraging Google for affiliate marketing, uncovering the strategies that can turn these opportunities into successful marketing ventures.
Maximizing Google Ads for Targeted Reach
When it comes to affiliate marketing, Google Ads stands out as a powerful tool. Its ability to reach a vast and varied audience is unmatched. By tapping into this platform, you can place your affiliate offers in front of the right eyes. The key here is to use Google's advanced targeting capabilities. Whether it's selecting specific demographics, interests, or even retargeting previous website visitors, Google Ads allows for a precision that can significantly improve the effectiveness of your campaigns. With the right strategy, your ads won't just reach more people; they'll reach the right people, increasing the likelihood of higher engagement and conversions.
Optimizing for Google’s Diverse Audience
Google’s user base is as diverse as it gets, encompassing various interests, ages, and geographical locations. This diversity presents a golden opportunity for affiliate marketers. By understanding the nuances of this audience – their search habits, preferences, and behavior online – you can tailor your content and ads to resonate more deeply with them. This might mean creating more targeted ad copy or choosing specific keywords that align closely with their search queries. The goal is to make your affiliate offers not just visible, but also relevant and appealing to the segments of Google's audience most likely to be interested in them.
Exploring Google Shopping for E-commerce Affiliates
For those in the e-commerce affiliate space, Google Shopping is a game-changer. This feature allows you to showcase products through visually appealing ads that include images, prices, and product descriptions, directly in the search results. This visual component can be particularly compelling, as it gives potential customers a clear and immediate idea of what you're offering. Moreover, because these ads appear based on the user's search query, they're already tailored to the user's immediate interests, increasing the chances of capturing their attention and directing them to your affiliate products.
Integrating with YouTube for Visual Impact
YouTube, as part of Google’s ecosystem, offers a unique avenue for affiliate marketers, especially when your products or services lend themselves well to visual representation. Imagine showcasing a product's features through a how-to video or a review, and then directly linking to your affiliate offer. YouTube not only helps in demonstrating the value of a product in a way that text and images can't match but also allows you to reach an audience that prefers video content. This integration means you can create comprehensive campaigns that span across Google's search engine and YouTube, offering multiple touchpoints to engage with your target audience.

In summary, Google’s suite of tools provides a rich and varied landscape for affiliate marketers. From the precision targeting of Google Ads and the wide-reaching appeal of its diverse audience, to the visual allure of Google Shopping and YouTube’s engaging video content, there’s a multitude of ways to amplify your affiliate marketing efforts. By strategically leveraging these tools, you can craft campaigns that not only reach a broad audience but also resonate deeply with them, driving conversions and bolstering your marketing success.
Navigating Performance Tracking and Analytics on Google in a Privacy-Conscious Era
In today’s digital marketing landscape, where data privacy regulations like GDPR and iOS14 updates have reshaped the rules of engagement, understanding and leveraging Google’s analytics capabilities becomes a pivotal aspect for affiliate media buyers. This environment demands a balance between insightful data collection and adherence to privacy norms, a challenge that Google's tools are well-equipped to meet.

At the core of Google's offering for performance tracking is Google Analytics. This tool provides a wealth of information about user interactions following ad clicks. You can track conversions, monitor user behavior on your site, and gather insights that are crucial for understanding the effectiveness of your affiliate campaigns. However, the shift towards privacy-centric marketing, propelled by GDPR and iOS14, means that the ways in which you collect and interpret this data must evolve.

The key is to focus on privacy-compliant data collection. Google Analytics has adapted to these changes, ensuring that the data collected is in line with the new regulations. This might mean relying more on aggregated and anonymized data, which, while less granular, still offers valuable insights into user behavior and campaign performance.

Another aspect to consider is the shift towards contextual targeting. With restrictions on personal data usage, placing ads based on the content being viewed by the user becomes increasingly important. This approach aligns with the privacy-first direction of the industry, reducing reliance on personal data while still allowing for effective targeting.

First-party data also takes on a new significance. Information directly collected from your website or Google ads, with user consent, becomes a goldmine. This data is not only more privacy-compliant but can also offer deep insights into customer preferences and behaviors.

In terms of adapting to the post-GDPR and iOS14 era, it's about redefining what successful tracking and attribution look like. This might mean shifting focus to broader campaign metrics like overall traffic, click-through rates, and conversion trends. While you may lose some of the granular tracking capabilities, these broader metrics still provide a solid foundation for evaluating campaign performance and making informed decisions.

In essence, navigating performance tracking and analytics on Google in this new era is about finding the sweet spot between gathering insightful data and respecting user privacy. By leveraging Google’s tools within the confines of GDPR and iOS14, affiliate media buyers can continue to drive successful campaigns, armed with data that is both insightful and ethically gathered. This approach not only aligns with regulatory demands but also fosters trust with your audience, an invaluable asset in the world of affiliate marketing.
Performance Tracking in Google’s Ecosystem for Affiliate Marketing Managers
In the realm of affiliate marketing, understanding the nuances of performance tracking within Google's advertising ecosystem is crucial for any marketing manager. This landscape is characterized by two primary tracking methods: native Google tracking tools and third-party trackers. Each plays a distinct role in the modern stack of affiliate media buyers, offering unique benefits and capabilities.

&nbsp;
Native Google Tracking for Affiliates
Google's native tracking tools, primarily Google Analytics and Google Ads conversion tracking, provide a foundation for understanding campaign performance. These tools offer insights into user interactions with your ads, allowing you to track key metrics like click-through rates, conversions, and return on ad spend.



 	Integration and Ease of Use: Native Google tools are seamlessly integrated with the Google Ads platform, ensuring a smooth tracking experience. Setting up these tools is relatively straightforward, allowing affiliate managers to quickly start gathering data.
 	Real-Time Data: Google Analytics offers real-time data, enabling immediate insights into how campaigns are performing, which is crucial for timely optimizations.
 	Audience Insights: These tools provide valuable information about the audience, such as demographics and behavior, which can be pivotal for refining targeting strategies.

However, while native Google tracking offers a wealth of data, it can sometimes lack the depth and granularity that more complex affiliate programs require. This is where third-party trackers come into play.
Third-Party Trackers: Extending Capabilities
Third-party tracking tools are designed to complement and extend the capabilities of native Google tracking. These tools are often more flexible and can provide deeper insights into the customer journey.

 	Enhanced Attribution Modeling: Third-party trackers offer sophisticated attribution models, which are crucial in understanding the multi-touchpoint nature of customer journeys in affiliate marketing. They can track interactions across various platforms and touchpoints, attributing conversions more accurately to different campaign elements.
 	Cross-Platform Integration: Unlike native Google tools, third-party trackers can integrate data from multiple advertising platforms. This holistic view is essential for affiliate managers overseeing campaigns across different channels, not just Google.
 	Advanced Segmentation and Personalization: These tools often allow for more advanced segmentation and personalization, providing deeper insights into specific user behaviors and enabling more targeted campaign adjustments.
 	Privacy and Compliance Features: In the face of tightening data privacy regulations, many third-party trackers offer advanced features to ensure compliance while still gathering useful data.

Their Role in the Affiliate Media Buyer's Stack
In the modern affiliate marketing landscape, both native Google tracking and third-party trackers are integral to a comprehensive strategy. Native Google tools provide a solid base of data and are crucial for campaigns heavily reliant on Google’s ecosystem. They offer simplicity, ease of integration, and real-time insights that are invaluable for quick decision-making.

Third-party trackers, on the other hand, bring additional layers of depth and breadth to performance tracking. They are particularly valuable for complex affiliate programs that span multiple platforms and require nuanced attribution models. Their advanced capabilities in cross-platform tracking and user segmentation make them a vital component in the affiliate marketer's toolkit.

In summary, a savvy affiliate marketing manager will likely employ both native Google tracking and third-party tools to create a robust, multi-faceted approach to campaign tracking. This combination ensures not only a comprehensive understanding of campaign performance but also a strategic alignment with evolving marketing objectives and regulatory landscapes.
Summary
Google emerges as a central pillar in the realm of digital marketing, providing media buyers and affiliate marketers with a versatile and powerful platform. Its vast user base, sophisticated targeting tools, and integration with a range of services make it a go-to choice for many marketers. By effectively harnessing Google’s capabilities and integrating third-party tracking tools, media buyers can navigate the digital advertising landscape successfully, achieving targeted outreach and maximizing return on investment in a privacy-conscious world.

Promoting Affiliate Offers and Products with YouTube Ads
Promoting products on YouTube requires a blend of strategic content creation and targeted ad placements. To optimize your affiliate marketing efforts and drive revenue on this platform, consider implementing the following tactics.


Leverage Diverse Ad Formats
In the arsenal of YouTube advertising, skippable ads are your go-to for extended narratives, allowing viewers the option to skip, which is valuable for gauging interest. Non-skippable ads guarantee full exposure for concise, punchy messages. For a quick brand impact, bumper ads, with their brief six-second span, are ideal for memory retention and offer promotion. Display ads are your silent sellers, sitting beside videos, perfect for visually appealing products.
Create Engaging Content
Begin your ads with intros that immediately offer value, capturing attention right off the bat. Employ narrative storytelling; share relatable success stories or testimonials that resonate with the viewer's own experiences. Ensure your calls-to-action are clear and direct, guiding viewers precisely to subscribe, click, or purchase.
Utilize Advanced Targeting
Refine your audience with demographic targeting, honing in on age, gender, location, and language. Interest-based targeting allows you to connect with users aligned with specific interests or behaviors, while custom affinity audiences let you craft an audience with particular interests linked to your product.
Optimize for Viewer Journey
Use sequential retargeting to maintain engagement with viewers across their buying journey, presenting them with varied ads that evolve as their interest develops. Schedule your ads strategically, so they appear when your target audience is most active, maximizing visibility and impact.
Incorporate SEO Techniques
Enhance your ad's visibility with keyword-rich titles and descriptions, making them more likely to appear in YouTube searches. Tag your videos with relevant keywords to further boost discoverability.
Engage and Build Community
Actively engage with your viewers by responding to comments. This not only builds a community around your channel but also enhances trust and credibility. Collaborating with influencers can extend your reach and lend authenticity to your brand.
Track and Optimize
Utilize analytics to keep a pulse on your ad's performance, understanding what resonates and what needs adjustment. Employ A/B testing to refine various ad elements, from visuals to calls-to-action, ensuring each aspect is optimized for conversion.

By integrating these tactics and continuously honing your strategy with data-driven insights, YouTube can serve as a potent channel for driving targeted traffic and generating revenue through affiliate marketing for media buyers.
Facebook vs. YouTube: Evaluating Traffic Potentials
For affiliate managers and media buyers, the choice between YouTube and Facebook should be based on specific campaign goals, target audiences, and desired interactions. YouTube is typically more effective for immersive brand storytelling and reaching a large, engaged audience, while Facebook excels in precise targeting and quick, conversion-oriented campaigns. By understanding the unique attributes of each platform, marketers can strategically align their campaigns to the most suitable platform or even leverage both for a comprehensive approach.

Understanding the viewer's journey from the initial impression to the final action is vital. By integrating your Google Ads account, you can track conversions directly tied to your YouTube ads. This isn't just about counting clicks; it's about understanding which videos are converting viewers into customers and why.

As you navigate through these tools, remember that your goal is to refine and enhance your campaigns continuously. The path to optimized campaigns and unrivaled ROI is paved with data-driven decisions, and with YouTube's robust tracking capabilities, you're well-equipped for the journey ahead. Sophisticated tracking requests can be satisfied with advanced third-party tracking solutions. Third-party trackers give you the broader view and deeper dive necessary to understand and influence the customer journey fully.
Leveraging Third-Party Advertising Trackers for Enhanced Youtube Insights
While YouTube's built-in analytics provide a robust foundation for understanding ad performance, the dynamic nature of affiliate marketing often requires a deeper dive into data and user behavior. This is where third-party advertising trackers come into play, offering an additional layer of insight and control that can significantly enhance your campaign's effectiveness.



 	Comprehensive Tracking Across Platforms: One of the primary advantages of third-party trackers is their ability to aggregate data across multiple platforms and campaigns. Unlike YouTube's analytics, which are confined to activity on the platform itself, third-party trackers can monitor user interactions across various digital touchpoints. This means you can track a customer's journey from a YouTube ad to your website, through email campaigns, and even onto other social platforms. Understanding this cross-platform behavior is crucial for creating a cohesive and personalized marketing strategy.
 	Advanced Attribution Modeling: Understanding the precise role that each marketing touchpoint plays in conversions is a critical aspect of optimizing your campaigns. Third-party trackers often offer advanced attribution models that go beyond the last-click attribution available in standard analytics. They can tell you not just where the conversion happened but also how each interaction contributed to the decision-making process. This insight allows marketers to allocate budgets more effectively and craft messages that resonate at different stages of the customer journey.
 	Real-Time Data and Customization: The speed and customization available with third-party trackers can provide a significant competitive edge. These systems often offer real-time data, allowing you to respond quickly to trends, adjust bids, and refine targeting on the fly. Additionally, the ability to customize what you track and how you view your data means you can focus on the metrics that matter most to your specific goals, whether that's click-through rates, conversion times, or the performance of specific ad elements.
 	Enhanced Fraud Detection: In the digital advertising world, fraud is an unfortunate reality that can skew your data and waste your budget. Third-party trackers often have sophisticated algorithms designed to detect and filter out fraudulent activity, ensuring that your decisions are based on accurate, reliable data.
 	Integration with Other Tools: Many third-party trackers offer integration with a wide range of other marketing tools, from CRM systems to email platforms. This integration allows for a more streamlined workflow and a more comprehensive view of your marketing efforts.

By leveraging both YouTube's built-in analytics and the advanced capabilities of third-party trackers, marketers can gain a more nuanced understanding of their audience, refine their strategies, and drive more effective campaigns.
Bottom lines
In the ever-evolving realm of digital marketing, YouTube stands as a powerful source of traffic for media buyers and affiliate managers. Its vast audience, diverse content, and sophisticated targeting options make it an indispensable tool in your advertising arsenal. By understanding and leveraging YouTube's unique advantages—from its engaging ad formats to its deep analytics and tracking tools—you can craft compelling campaigns that resonate with viewers and drive conversions. Remember, success on this platform isn't just about broadcasting content; it's about engaging with an audience, understanding their behaviors, and delivering value that speaks directly to their interests and needs. As you harness the potential of YouTube for your media buying strategies, keep testing, learning, and optimizing.

10147,Ultimate Guide: How To Do Media Buying And Affiliate Marketing With Instagram,"In the fast-paced world of digital marketing, Instagram has emerged as a key player for media buyers and affiliate marketers. Known for its visually-driven content and highly engaged user base, Instagram provides a unique platform for brands looking to enhance their digital presence and drive sales. This article aims to guide media buyers and affiliate marketers in harnessing Instagram's potential, offering insights and strategies to maximize impact on this dynamic platform.
Instagram for Media Buyers: Leveraging the Platform's Strengths
Instagram, with its visually rich content and active user base, offers several advantages for media buyers and affiliate managers:

 	Broad Audience: Instagram boasts millions of active users, providing a vast audience for targeted campaigns.
 	High Engagement: Users on Instagram are known for high engagement rates, often interacting with brands and content they love.
 	Sophisticated Targeting: Leveraging Facebook’s advertising system, Instagram offers powerful targeting options including demographics, interests, and behavior.
 	Diverse Ad Formats: From Stories to IGTV and traditional posts, Instagram offers various formats for creative and effective advertising.
 	Influencer Partnerships: The platform is renowned for its influencers, who can amplify brand messages and reach niche audiences.
 	Trackable Performance: Instagram’s analytics tools allow for detailed tracking of engagement, reach, and conversion metrics.
 	Mobile-First Experience: With its mobile-centric design, Instagram is ideal for reaching audiences on-the-go.

Promoting Affiliate Offers on Instagram
To optimize your affiliate marketing efforts on Instagram, consider these detailed strategies.

 	Utilize Stories and Highlights for Timely and Evergreen ContentUtilizing Instagram Stories and Highlights can significantly enhance the visibility of your offers. Stories, with their 24-hour lifespan, are perfect for creating a sense of urgency around limited-time deals. Meanwhile, Highlights allow you to categorize and preserve these stories, making them a permanent fixture on your profile for new and returning visitors. For accounts with access, incorporating swipe-up links in these Stories can directly guide users to your affiliate products, simplifying the journey from discovery to purchase.
 	Leverage Influencer Partnerships for Wider Reach
The power of influencer partnerships on Instagram cannot be overstated. By collaborating with influencers whose followers align with your target audience, you can tap into their credibility and reach. These partnerships work best when they feel authentic; sponsored posts should be genuine and reflective of the influencer's real experience with your product.
 	Engage with Interactive Content to Boost Interest
Interactive content is another key to engagement. Polls, quizzes, and Q&amp;A sessions in Stories invite interaction and make users feel a part of your brand's narrative. This not only boosts engagement but also provides valuable insights into your audience’s preferences, guiding your future content strategy.
 	Optimize Your Bio for Affiliate Marketing
Your Instagram bio is prime real estate for affiliate marketing. This small space can have a big impact when used wisely. A compelling call-to-action coupled with a link to your affiliate offers is essential. For accounts promoting multiple products, link-in-bio tools can direct users to a curated list of links. Keeping this link updated with your latest or most popular offer ensures your bio remains relevant and effective.
 	Create Visually Appealing Posts to Attract and Retain Attention
Creating visually appealing posts is crucial on a platform that's all about visuals. High-quality images and videos that showcase your affiliate products in a lifestyle context can make them more relatable and desirable to your audience. Consistency in branding and aesthetics also helps in making your posts instantly recognizable to your followers.
 	Use Hashtags Strategically to Increase Post Visibility
Hashtags are a powerful tool on Instagram, but they must be used strategically. A mix of popular, niche, branded hashtags, along with some Instagram likes can extend the post's reach beyond your immediate followers, tapping into larger communities interested in your content. However, it's important to focus on the quality and relevance of hashtags rather than their quantity.

Employ Instagram Ads to Amplify Reach
Instagram ads are an invaluable tool for media buyers. They offer a way to reach a larger and more targeted audience. Ads that blend seamlessly with organic content tend to be more effective, as they integrate naturally into users’ feeds. Experimenting with different ad formats, like carousel ads, video ads, or sponsored Stories, can help you discover what resonates best with your audience. Tracking the performance of these ads is crucial to understanding their return on investment and refining your targeting strategies.

In summary, promoting affiliate offers on Instagram is an art that combines the strategic use of the platform's features with a deep understanding of your audience. From leveraging Stories and influencers to optimizing your bio and employing targeted ads, each aspect plays a crucial role in the success of your affiliate marketing efforts.
Instagram vs. YouTube vs. TikTok: Evaluating Platforms for Affiliate Marketing
In the dynamic landscape of social media, Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok each offer unique opportunities and challenges for affiliate marketing. Understanding their distinct characteristics is key to devising a strategy that leverages the strengths of each platform.
Instagram: The Visual Storyteller
Instagram thrives on its visually rich content and high engagement levels. Its format is ideal for showcasing products in a visually appealing manner, using a blend of images, short videos, and Stories. Instagram's audience tends to seek inspiration and quick content, often leading to rapid interaction with posts. The platform's sophisticated targeting, driven by Facebook's advertising system, allows for precise audience segmentation. This makes it particularly effective for brands looking to create a visually compelling narrative and engage users with aesthetically driven content. However, Instagram's content has a more ephemeral nature, with posts quickly losing visibility in followers' feeds.
YouTube: The Deep-Dive Platform
In contrast, YouTube is a platform for longer, more in-depth content. It's where users go for detailed information, tutorials, and comprehensive product reviews. This allows for immersive brand storytelling and the building of a more informed audience. YouTube videos often have a longer lifespan, continuing to attract views long after they are posted. The platform offers broad targeting options, but it's particularly effective for reaching users who are in the research phase of their buying journey. The longer format of YouTube videos offers a deeper dive into product features and benefits, which can be more convincing for certain products or services. However, producing quality YouTube content often requires more resources and a different skill set than Instagram.
TikTok: The Trend-Setting Challenger
TikTok, the newest contender in this trio, brings a unique flavor to affiliate marketing. Known for its short-form, highly engaging videos, TikTok has quickly become a hub for viral content. The platform's algorithm is designed to rapidly amplify popular content, offering the potential for massive reach even for new creators. TikTok's content is often more raw and authentic, resonating with a younger audience that values genuineness over polished aesthetics. This makes it an excellent platform for viral marketing campaigns and reaching a younger demographic. However, the unpredictable nature of what goes viral on TikTok can make it a less reliable platform for consistent affiliate marketing success.
Choosing the Right Platform
When choosing between Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok for affiliate marketing, consider your target audience, the nature of your product, and the type of content you are best equipped to produce. Instagram is ideal for visually appealing products and brands with a strong aesthetic appeal. YouTube is better suited for products that benefit from in-depth explanations or demonstration. TikTok, on the other hand, is ideal for products that can tap into current trends and appeal to a younger, trend-savvy audience.

In conclusion, while Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok each offer unique avenues for affiliate marketing, the most effective strategy might involve leveraging the strengths of all three. By understanding the distinct appeal and audience of each platform, marketers can create a diverse and robust affiliate marketing strategy that maximizes reach and engagement across the social media spectrum.


Maximizing Instagram Insights for Effective Campaigns: A Data-Driven Approach
In the realm of affiliate marketing on Instagram, harnessing the power of Instagram Insights is pivotal for media buyers. This data-driven approach not only enhances the effectiveness of campaigns but also ensures a strategic alignment with audience preferences and behaviors.
The Power of Instagram Insights
Instagram Insights provides a treasure trove of data that is invaluable for affiliate media buyers. By analyzing metrics such as engagement rates, reach, impressions, and follower demographics, media buyers can gain a comprehensive understanding of their audience. This understanding is crucial for tailoring content and ads to resonate with the target audience. For instance, insights into peak activity times can guide the scheduling of posts and stories, ensuring maximum visibility.
Understanding Audience Demographics
The demographic data available in Instagram Insights, such as age, gender, and location of your audience, enables media buyers to refine their targeting strategies. This demographic breakdown can help in customizing content to suit the preferences and interests of different segments, enhancing the relevance and effectiveness of affiliate promotions.
Analyzing Post Performance
Instagram Insights also provides detailed data on the performance of individual posts and stories. By analyzing which types of content generate the most engagement, media buyers can identify trends and patterns. This information is crucial for optimizing content strategy. Whether it’s the style of imagery, the tone of the copy, or the type of products featured, understanding what resonates with the audience helps in creating more impactful content.
Tracking Conversion and ROI
For affiliate media buyers, tracking conversions and calculating ROI are key components of their strategy. While Instagram Insights provides baseline engagement metrics, integrating tracking links and utilizing UTM parameters in affiliate links can help in tracing the direct impact of Instagram content on sales. This level of tracking enables a clear understanding of the return on investment from Instagram affiliate campaigns.
Benefits of a Data-Driven Approach
Adopting a data-driven approach provides several advantages for affiliate media buyers:

 	Enhanced Targeting and Personalization: Data from Instagram Insights enables more precise targeting and personalization, increasing the relevance and effectiveness of affiliate marketing campaigns.
 	Optimized Content Strategy: Insights into what type of content performs best allow for the fine-tuning of content strategies to align with audience preferences, maximizing engagement and interest.
 	Improved Campaign ROI: By understanding which aspects of the campaign are driving conversions, media buyers can allocate their budget more effectively, improving the overall return on investment.
 	Adaptability and Responsiveness: A data-driven approach allows media buyers to quickly adapt to changing trends and audience behaviors, keeping the affiliate marketing strategy agile and responsive.

In conclusion, for affiliate media buyers on Instagram, delving deep into Instagram Insights and adopting a data-driven approach is not just beneficial, it's essential. It allows for the crafting of campaigns that are not only creative and visually appealing but also finely tuned to the preferences and behaviors of the target audience. This approach ensures that every aspect of the campaign, from content creation to targeting and timing, is optimized for maximum impact and effectiveness.
Third-Party Tracking Tools for Enhanced Insights: Navigating Post-GDPR and iOS14 Era
The digital marketing landscape has experienced significant shifts with the introduction of GDPR in Europe and Apple’s iOS14 updates, particularly in the realm of conversion tracking. These changes have heightened privacy regulations and limited the use of traditional tracking methods, leading to a surge in the adoption of third-party tracking tools by affiliate media buyers.
The GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and iOS14 updates have reshaped how data is collected and used, prioritizing user privacy. This resulted in limitations on conventional tracking methods, notably affecting the accuracy of conversion tracking on platforms like Instagram and Facebook. As a result, third-party trackers have gained prominence, offering sophisticated and compliant alternatives to navigate these restrictions. These tools have become essential for affiliate media buyers seeking to maintain accurate and actionable insights into their campaigns.
Advantages of Third-Party Tracking Tools: Beyond Standard Instagram and Facebook Tracking
Third-party tracking tools offer several key advantages that extend beyond the capabilities of standard Instagram and Facebook analytics:

 	Cross-Platform Tracking: Unlike platform-specific insights, third-party trackers can track user interactions across various digital touchpoints, providing a holistic view of the customer journey.
 	Advanced Attribution Models: These tools often feature sophisticated attribution models that go beyond last-click attribution, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of how each marketing touchpoint contributes to conversions.
 	Customizable Dashboards and Reports: Third-party trackers provide customizable dashboards and reports, enabling media buyers to focus on the metrics most relevant to their specific goals and strategies.
 	Real-Time Data and Alerts: They offer real-time data tracking and alerts, facilitating immediate adjustments to campaigns, which is crucial in the fast-paced digital marketing environment.
 	Enhanced Audience Segmentation: With more detailed data, these tools allow for enhanced audience segmentation and targeting, leading to more personalized and effective marketing efforts.
 	Improved Data Accuracy and Compliance: In the post-GDPR and iOS14 era, third-party trackers offer solutions that respect privacy regulations while still providing accurate and actionable data.
 	Fraud Detection and Prevention: Many third-party tracking tools come equipped with advanced algorithms to detect and prevent fraudulent activity, ensuring the integrity of campaign data.
 	Integration with Other Marketing Tools: They often feature seamless integration with a range of other marketing tools and platforms, providing a more cohesive and efficient workflow.

Navigating the New Landscape with Third-Party Tools
The rise of third-party tracking tools in response to GDPR and iOS14 restrictions represents a pivotal shift in digital marketing. These tools not only help affiliate media buyers navigate the new privacy-centric landscape but also offer enhanced capabilities that go beyond traditional platform-based analytics. By leveraging these tools, media buyers can gain deeper insights, drive more personalized and effective campaigns, and ultimately achieve a higher return on investment. In conclusion, the adoption of third-party tracking tools has become essential in the current era of digital marketing. They provide affiliate media buyers with the advanced capabilities needed to navigate the complexities of post-GDPR and iOS14 conversion tracking while offering a range of additional benefits that enhance campaign performance and ROI.
Key takeaways
Instagram represents a dynamic and impactful platform for media buyers and affiliate marketers. Its visual nature, combined with a highly engaged user base, makes it an essential component of any digital marketing strategy. By leveraging its strengths, from diverse ad formats to the power of influencer marketing, and coupling these with insightful analytics and tracking tools, marketers can effectively navigate this platform. The key to success on Instagram lies in creating visually appealing, engaging content that resonates with your audience, underpinned by a strategy that is continuously refined based on data-driven insights.

Bing: The Niche Advantage

 	Audience Demographics: Bing’s audience often includes older and more affluent users, who may have higher spending power. This is particularly beneficial for products or services targeting this demographic.

Performance Tracking and Analytics on Bing for Affiliate Media Buyers
Understanding how performance tracking and analytics work on Bing is crucial for affiliate media buyers, especially in navigating the challenges posed by GDPR and iOS14. Bing provides a range of tools and features to help track and analyze the performance of affiliate campaigns.
Bing's Universal Event Tracking (UET)

 	Setup and Integration: UET involves placing a single tag across your website. This tag tracks what customers do after clicking on your ads, providing insights into behavior and conversions.
 	Conversion Tracking: UET allows you to track specific actions on your site, such as purchases, sign-ups, or downloads. This is critical for measuring the effectiveness of affiliate campaigns.
 	Goal Setting and Monitoring: Affiliate media buyers can set specific goals within Bing Ads, tied to the UET. This allows for the tracking of specific outcomes aligned with campaign objectives.

Audience Insights

 	Understanding User Behavior: Bing provides data on how different audiences interact with your ads. This includes demographic information, search terms used, and devices employed.
 	Custom Audience Targeting: Based on this data, you can create custom audiences on Bing, ensuring that your ads are shown to users most likely to be interested in your affiliate products.

Analytics Dashboards

By utilizing UET, leveraging audience insights, and customizing analytics dashboards, media buyers can gain a deep understanding of their campaign performance. Adapting these tools to comply with GDPR and iOS14 regulations ensures that affiliate marketing efforts are both effective and privacy-compliant.
Maximizing Bing's Analytics for Effective Campaigns in the Post-GDPR and iOS14 Era
The introduction of GDPR in Europe and Apple's iOS14 updates have significantly reshaped the digital marketing landscape, especially in terms of data privacy and tracking. These changes present both challenges and opportunities for affiliate media buyers using Bing. Understanding how to maximize Bing's analytics while navigating these new regulations is key to successful campaigns.
Understanding the Impact of GDPR and iOS14
GDPR Compliance: The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) affects how marketers collect and process data from EU residents. For Bing advertisers, this means ensuring that data collection is compliant with GDPR's consent and transparency requirements.

iOS14 Limitations: Apple's iOS14 update introduced changes that limit data tracking on iPhones and iPads. This impacts the way advertisers on Bing and other platforms can track user behavior, conversions, and effectiveness of ads on iOS devices.

Privacy-Centric Marketing: These regulations necessitate a shift towards more privacy-centric marketing strategies. Affiliate media buyers need to rely more on aggregated and anonymized data, rather than individual tracking.
Maximizing Bing's Analytics within New Regulations

 	Utilizing Bing's Privacy-Compliant Features: Leverage Bing's tools that are designed to be compliant with GDPR and iOS14. For example, using conversion tracking that respects user privacy settings.
 	Focusing on Contextual Targeting: With limitations on personal data usage, contextual targeting becomes more crucial. This involves placing ads based on the content being viewed by the user, rather than personal data.
 	Emphasizing First-Party Data: Collect and utilize first-party data with consent. This includes data gathered directly from your website or Bing ads, which can be used to understand customer behavior and preferences.
 	Enhancing Audience Targeting: Use Bing's audience targeting features, such as In-market Audiences, to reach users based on their interests and behaviors while respecting privacy norms.
 	Diversifying Ad Formats: Experiment with different ad formats on Bing to see which works best within the constraints of GDPR and iOS14. For instance, testing text ads versus shopping ads to gauge performance differences.

Adapting Strategies in the Post-GDPR and iOS14 Era

 	Redefining Measurement Metrics: In the absence of granular tracking, focus on broader campaign metrics like overall traffic, click-through rates, and conversion trends rather than individual user tracking.
 	Using Aggregate Data for Insights: Rely on aggregated data provided by Bing to understand campaign performance. This includes trends in user engagement, search queries, and overall campaign effectiveness.
 	Leveraging Bing's Universal Event Tracking (UET): UET allows for tracking user actions on your website post-click, which can be a valuable source of information while being compliant with privacy regulations.
 	Implementing Consent Management Platforms (CMPs): Use CMPs to manage user consents effectively, ensuring that your Bing advertising strategies are compliant with GDPR.
 	Adjusting Attribution Models: With limited tracking capabilities, consider shifting to attribution models that don’t rely heavily on user-specific data, such as first-click or last-click attribution.

Navigating the post-GDPR and iOS14 era requires affiliate media buyers on Bing to adapt their strategies, focusing on privacy-compliant practices and making the most of Bing’s analytics within these new boundaries. By shifting towards contextual targeting, leveraging first-party data, and redefining success metrics, marketers can continue to run effective campaigns while respecting user privacy and adhering to the latest regulations. This approach not only ensures compliance but also encourages the adoption of more innovative and user-centric advertising strategies.
The Role of Third-Party Trackers in Enhancing Bing Performance Tracking
In the complex and ever-evolving world of affiliate marketing, third-party tracking tools play a pivotal role, especially when integrated with platforms like Bing. These tools enhance the capabilities of Bing’s native analytics, providing affiliate media buyers with deeper insights and more granular data tracking.
Enhanced Data Tracking and Attribution
Third-party trackers supplement Bing's Universal Event Tracking (UET) by offering comprehensive conversion tracking. They go beyond basic tracking by analyzing user interactions across various touchpoints, thus providing a complete view of the customer's journey. Additionally, these tools support sophisticated attribution models like linear, time-decay, and position-based models, helping affiliate media buyers accurately assess the impact of different touchpoints in the conversion process.
Cross-Platform and Multi-Channel Tracking
A key strength of third-party trackers lies in their ability to consolidate data from different platforms. This integration means that performance data from Bing can be analyzed in conjunction with data from other channels, offering a comprehensive overview of overall campaign performance. These trackers also shed light on multi-channel funnels, revealing how Bing ads interact with other channels in the wider affiliate marketing strategy.
Improved Targeting and Personalization
Third-party trackers provide detailed data that enables more precise audience segmentation. This enhanced data allows for the creation of more personalized campaigns targeted at specific user groups. Moreover, these tools often include powerful retargeting capabilities, enabling affiliate media buyers to re-engage with users who have interacted with their Bing ads but have not yet converted.
Compliance and Privacy Management
In the wake of GDPR and iOS14 updates, third-party trackers have evolved to offer privacy-compliant tracking solutions. They help manage user consent and ensure that data collection is in line with legal requirements. These tools also focus on anonymized data tracking, respecting user anonymity and ensuring compliance with privacy laws and platform regulations.
Reporting and Analytics
Third-party trackers offer customizable reporting features, allowing media buyers to focus on the metrics most relevant to their goals. The depth and breadth of data provided by these tools translate into actionable insights, aiding media buyers in making informed decisions to optimize their campaigns.
Integration with Bing
Most third-party trackers can be seamlessly integrated with Bing, facilitating easy tracking of Bing-specific campaigns along with other marketing efforts. They ensure that data from Bing is accurately synchronized and reflected in overall performance metrics, providing a unified view of campaign effectiveness.

Third-party tracking tools are indispensable for affiliate media buyers using Bing, especially in the context of complex digital marketing strategies and stringent privacy regulations. By providing enhanced tracking capabilities, sophisticated attribution models, and comprehensive cross-platform analytics, these tools empower media buyers to track, analyze, and optimize their Bing campaigns with greater precision and effectiveness. Integrating third-party trackers with Bing is a strategic move that can significantly elevate the performance tracking and overall success of affiliate marketing initiatives.

Conversion API tracking is essentially a smarter way for businesses to keep an eye on how well their ads are doing. Instead of using old methods that miss key details because of browser or privacy issues, this method sends data directly from your company's server to the ad platform's server. This gives you a better view of what's happening, like sales or sign-ups, because of your ads. It avoids the usual online problems and privacy worries, giving you a clear picture of how well your ads are doing.
How does conversion API tracking work?
Conversion API tracking operates through an S2S communication channel, a more reliable and privacy-compliant method compared to traditional client-side tracking mechanisms like cookies.

Imagine someone clicks on your advertisement and then does something important on your site, like buying something or signing up for your newsletter. This action sets off what's known as a conversion event within your website's system. Instead of counting on a pixel on the web browser to catch this event - which might not work if someone is using an ad blocker or if the browser has tough privacy settings - your server picks up on this activity directly.

Next, your server puts this event information into a neat package, often using a format called JSON, and sends it over to the ad platform's server with something called an HTTP POST request. This step is carried out using the ad platform's Conversion API, a special tool built for handling these kinds of data transfers from one server to another.


Conversion API tracking alternatives
To appreciate the innovation behind Conversion API tracking, it's essential to understand its predecessors:

 	Pixel Tracking: Relies on a small piece of code (the pixel) embedded on a webpage, which signals a server when a page is loaded. While effective, its reliance on browsers makes it vulnerable to cookie restrictions and ad blockers, leading to data loss and inaccuracies.
 	Postback Tracking &amp; S2S Tracking: These methods facilitate data exchange between servers after a specific action is completed. They offer improved data security and accuracy but need more direct integration and comprehensive data capture of Conversion API.

See our post on Tracking Pixel and S2S Postback URL tracking.

With the advent of Conversion API tracking, marketers now have a solution that combines the best of both worlds: the comprehensive data collection of pixel tracking and the reliability and privacy compliance of server-based methods.


Benefits of Conversion API Tracking
When you look closer, the benefits of this approach are even more evident:

 	Privacy First: With laws like GDPR in Europe impacting over half a billion internet users and CCPA in California, the server-side method of the Conversion API prioritizes user privacy in data tracking.
 	Bypass Ad Blockers: With 42.7% of internet users worldwide using ad blockers, traditional data collection is often compromised. The Conversion API sidesteps these issues, offering a complete picture of user activities.
 	Unified Customer Journey Tracking: As users frequently switch among an average of 3.6 devices, keeping track of their journey can be challenging with old methods. The Conversion API connects these dots, offering a cohesive view across devices and platforms.
 	Instant Data Insights: The Conversion API enables real-time data sharing, allowing advertisers to adapt to trends and adjust campaigns for optimal performance quickly.
 	Tailored Tracking: This approach lets advertisers customize and monitor various actions specific to their objectives, such as online purchases or lead captures, ensuring the data is precisely what they need.
 	Secure Data Transfer: Direct server-to-server data transmission reduces the chances of interception, keeping sensitive customer information safe and secure.

10207,Clicks to Insights: Conversion & Event Tracking with Pixels,"Digital marketing without insights into user behavior is challenging. Each interaction, from clicks to purchases, contains valuable data that, when properly analyzed, can significantly refine your marketing strategies. Conversion and event tracking are essential for unlocking these insights, serving as your guide through the complexities of digital engagement.

Let's break it down: conversion and event tracking are like the digital marketing world's GPS. They help you understand where users go on your site, what they do, and what convinces them to take actions like buying something or signing up. This tracking is crucial because it tells you what's working in your strategies and what's just taking up space.

This article aims to demystify conversion and event tracking, providing clarity on how to effectively leverage these tools. Here’s what we’ll cover:

 	What are tracking pixels, and why are they crucial for data collection?
 	Which pixels do you really need?
 	How does tracking transform digital marketing?
 	How do these pixels capture data?
 	What sets pixel tracking apart?
 	How to keep your tracking compliant?


What Is a Tracking Pixel?
A tracking pixel, sometimes just called a ""pixel,"" is a minuscule image, typically just 1x1 pixel in size, embedded within web pages, emails, or digital ads. Its unassuming nature belies its capability to gather comprehensive data on user behaviors and interactions across the digital landscape.

When users engage with content housing a tracking pixel, whether by visiting a webpage or opening an email, the pixel springs into action, relaying information back to its originating server. This mechanism enables the collection of diverse insights, including:

 	Page Views: Offering a window into the popularity and reach of specific web content.
 	User Demographics: Providing anonymized data on user location, device type, and browser usage.
 	Conversion Insights: Highlighting the effectiveness of marketing efforts by tracking desired user actions.
 	Ad Performance Analysis: Assessing the impact of advertising campaigns through engagement metrics.

 	Smart Spending: Pinpoint where your marketing dollars make the most impact, allowing you to invest wisely and boost your ROI.
 	Learning from the Pros: Look at the success stories across various industries leveraging tracking to enhance user engagement and drive growth.

How Tracking Pixels Work
Picture this: tiny digital helpers spread all over your website, in emails, and on ads. These are tracking pixels, and they're kind of like invisible informants sending messages back to your team. They get tucked into your online stuff with a bit of HTML code, the language websites speak, creating a direct chat line from the visitor's browser straight to your analytics board.

Here's the play-by-play when someone checks out your content with one of these pixels in it. Their browser, basically the internet tool they're using, gives a shout to the server where the pixel hangs out. It's like saying, ""Hey, someone just looked at this page or opened this email. What's up with that?"" This kick-starts the whole tracking process.

The server takes this shout and writes down everything about the visit. It's not just ticking off that the page got a look-see or the email got a peek. It notes the specific stuff the visitor checked out, how long they hung around, and if they clicked anything special. This level of detail is gold for figuring out what parts of your site or which emails are hitting the mark.

But wait, there’s more. These pixels can tell you about the visitor's tech setup, like if they’re scrolling on a phone or clicking away at a computer. They can even identify the type of phone or computer and the web browser being used. Knowing all this helps make sure your website or app works great, no matter what device someone’s using.

These clever pixels also get the lowdown on where in the world your visitors are, based on their internet address. This helps you make sure what you're showing them makes sense for where they are, making your messages and ads feel more personal.

And there’s a time stamp on everything, showing when folks are most likely to drop by. This intel is super helpful for sending out emails or posting on social media at just the right time.

But that’s not all. With a few tweaks, tracking pixels can also keep an eye on specific actions, like if someone fills out a form, watches a video, or downloads something from your site. This gives you a full picture of how people interact with what you offer, way beyond just visiting a page.

In short, these hidden pixel pals are busy collecting all kinds of info, turning every visit and click into insights you can actually use. They help you understand what’s working, what’s not, and how you can make your online space better for everyone who stops by.


Pixels Vs. Other Methods
Tracking pixels are super handy for getting a quick look at what's happening on your site or with your ads, but they're just one piece of the puzzle. There are other ways to keep tabs on user behavior that can complement or even enhance what pixels do.

Challenges and Solutions in Pixel Tracking
Pixel tracking is a key part of figuring out what's working in your online ads, but sometimes things don’t go as planned.

While these problems can mess with getting a good read on how users behave on your site, there are smart ways to tackle them.

 	Pixels Not Doing Their Job? Check How You Set Them Up: If pixels aren’t catching every click or view, there might be a hiccup in how they were set up. Making sure your pixels are in the right spot and set up correctly is crucial. RedTrack is a tool that can help you keep an eye on your pixels, making sure they're always ready to capture important actions.
 	Worried About Ad Blockers? Try Mixing It Up: With more people using ad blockers, your pixels might not catch everything. That’s where mixing different tracking methods can save the day. Adding server-to-server (S2S) tracking to your toolkit can help you keep collecting data, even when pixels get blocked. It's a secure way to make sure you’re still in the loop on user actions.
 	Filling in the Gaps: Even with your best efforts, you might not catch every detail with pixels alone. That’s where a platform like RedTrack shines. It helps you piece together the whole story of what users are doing on your site by combining different types of data, from cross-platform insights to up-to-the-minute analytics.


Keeping Privacy in Mind
Laws like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the U.S. have set new standards. These regulations aren’t just hurdles to overcome; they’re reminders of the importance of respecting user privacy while collecting valuable data.

Modern tracking technologies are evolving, with a keen focus on safeguarding user privacy. They’re designed to gather insights without overstepping boundaries, ensuring that the data collected is done so with integrity. Here’s what keeping privacy in mind involves:

 	It’s all about being clear with your users. This means letting them know which data you’re collecting, why you’re collecting it, and how it will be used. Transparency builds trust, and trust is invaluable in today’s digital landscape.
 	Now, getting explicit consent from users before tracking their behavior is standard practice. This consent should be easy to give and just as easy to withdraw, empowering users to have control over their own data.
 	Collecting more data than necessary just because you can isn’t the way to go. The focus now is on data minimization, which means collecting only the data that’s essential for your goals. This approach not only complies with privacy laws but also streamlines your data analysis process, allowing you to focus on what truly matters.
 	Ensuring that the data you collect is securely stored and managed is non-negotiable. This involves using encryption, regular security audits, and having protocols in place for data breaches. Secure data handling practices reassure users that their information is in safe hands.
 	Privacy laws and user expectations are always evolving. Staying informed about the latest developments in privacy regulations and being ready to adapt your tracking practices accordingly is vital. This proactive approach not only keeps you compliant but also demonstrates your commitment to user privacy.

What’s Next for Tracking?
The future looks bright, with advancements in AI and new methods that don’t rely on traditional cookies, promising more precise and privacy-friendly tracking. We’re heading towards a world where understanding user behavior will be easier and less intrusive.

Keeping an eye on how people interact with your digital content is invaluable, and tracking pixels are one of the best tools for the job. They help paint a detailed picture of user behavior, allowing for personalized experiences and smarter spending on ads. As technology evolves, so too does the way we track, making it an exciting time to be in digital marketing. By staying informed and adaptable, you can use these insights to not only meet but exceed your marketing goals.

Tactic 1: Do SEO Audit for Your Affiliate Website
Did you know that 74% of Internet consumers in the U.S. visit numerous affiliate websites before making a purchase? According to studies, they prefer the top-ranking quality websites over those that don't make it to the first page of search results.

So, even if your SEO affiliate sites are doing alright now, it’s always a good idea to run a website audit and check how your SEO is performing. 

You probably have done it a million times before, but it’s still a good idea to go over our short checklists. They сover the most important areas you have to focus on during your audit (and include our favorite tools). 
Technical SEO Checklist
If you want to ensure your technical SEO is spot-on, answer these questions:

 	Is my site's speed optimal? Check it now using Pagespeed! 
 	Is my site mobile-friendly?
 	Do I have any broken pages and links to fix? Find out with Broken Link Checker!
 	Have I enabled HTTPS?
 	Does Google Search Console detect any issues?
 	Are there any duplicate meta titles and meta descriptions?

On-Page SEO Checklist
Let’s go over some key questions to make sure your on-page SEO is working well:

 	Do my pages have a logical structure (H1, H2, H3)? 
 	Are my blog posts optimized around specific, relevant keywords?
 	Is my content comprehensive, valuable, and engaging for readers? 
 	Do my title tags accurately reflect the page content? Do my meta descriptions compellingly summarize what the page is all about?
 	Does my website have a good interlinking between pages?
 	Does my site have relevant, reputable external links?


Tactic 2: Use Non-Generic Keywords for Maximum Visibility
Posts that contain target keywords get a 45% higher CTR compared to those that don’t. 

So, if you want to catch the eye of both search engines and your target audience, sprinkle the right keywords throughout the text with a well-thought strategy in mind. 

Having one guarantees that you won’t just have more searchers land on your page. You can make those posts do different jobs for your SEO affiliate campaign, whether that’s driving more traffic or increasing conversions. Just by placing the targeted keywords in the right spots!

Let’s look at some specific keyword types that are especially useful for your SEO affiliate sites.
Long-Tail Keywords
Using long-tail keywords opens many doors for affiliate SEO.

First, long-tail low-volume keywords are easier to rank for compared to the high-volume terms that all your competitors are chasing. You'll get to the first page of Google faster with long-tails.

Sure, targeting long-tail keywords brings less traffic, but it's highly targeted traffic. Attracted by long keywords, searchers who land on your page know what they’re looking for. This means you're gonna see way higher conversion rates. 

Finally, long-tail keywords are your ticket to Google's featured snippets. They increase your chances of ranking for target search terms. Just quickly add long-tails to your FAQ sections! By using them, you also optimize your SEO affiliate sites for voice search, which takes up 20% of Google searches. 
Buyer Intent Keywords
You know better than anyone how long it takes to nurture prospects and turn them into buyers. That said, there are plenty of searchers out there who are ready to buy a product RIGHT NOW.

You can cater directly to those ready-to-purchase customers and create content filled with buyer-intent keywords so that they can find your affiliate SEO website faster.

These keywords typically contain action-oriented words:

 	Get + product + today
 	Purchase + product
 	Buy + product + now
 	Cheap + product

You can also target location-based keywords that include phrases like ""near me"" or your target location city/country name to attract local buyers. Recent statistics show that almost 50% of Google searches are local, so don't miss out on this opportunity.
Brand Keywords
Branded keywords are even more specific than buyer intent keywords.

Users who type them into the search box are interested in what you have to offer, so it takes little to no effort to convert them. You’ll see the organic traffic grow and the conversion rates go up. 

Plus, Google loves to rank branded keywords highly because they show a strong brand presence.


Tactic 3. Choose a SEO-Friendly Domain Name
Tell me what’s your domain name and I’ll tell you how high you rank on Google.

In affiliate SEO marketing, the domain name is one of many ingredients for success, so don’t forget to work on it if you’re looking to start a new niche blog. You can boost your site’s visibility and ranking by choosing a SEO-friendly name that is:

 	Easy to remember: The catchier your name, the more people come back to your site. That signals to Google that your content is valuable, so it’ll rank you higher.
 	Short and simple: This one comes from the previous point. Short, simple domain names get more traffic because people find it easier to remember and type them into a search bar.
 	Keyword- and brand-optimized: Ideally, you need a domain name that includes a relevant keyword plus a term that speaks to the nature of your business. 

Tactic 4. Optimize Your Existing Content for Maximum Reach
If you have a reputable affiliate website, the last thing you need to do is to start fresh.

Your blog likely has some posts that are already doing pretty well. They just need a little tweak to get you high on Google’s ranking. 

Here are our favorite SEO tips for affiliate marketing that can help you fine-tune your existing content for maximum reach:

 	Put affiliate links in top-performing articles. Identify posts that get the most traffic with SEO analytics tools. Then, rewrite some content pieces to add affiliate keywords in a natural way. Once you're done, link these keywords to your affiliate products.
 	Work on your meta titles and descriptions. Make them clear, simple, captivating, and keyword-friendly to increase your CTR and visibility.
 	Add new valuable information to old posts. Check your top-performing posts one more time and see if you can add new information and remove outdated facts, statistics, or broken links. 


Tactic 5. Craft New Content That Showcases Experience
SEO experts state that one of the key ranking factors in 2023 is quality content.

In 2024, nothing has changed. Online users still crave valuable, informative content. And you still have to scratch your head to create this SEO affiliate content that answers their questions, solves their problems, and promotes your affiliate products. Too many goals for one post, right?

While we can’t take the creative work off your shoulders, we can suggest the top 4 post types that can check these boxes for you:

 	Long-Form Guides. These are in-depth posts that kill two birds with one stone: they bring value to your reader by exploring your product and give enough room to place affiliate links.
 	Comparison Posts. Product comparison is one of the highest-converting content types, as it sits right at the bottom of the funnel. Leverage these posts to show how your product stands against the competition.


 	Case Studies. Here, you can give a detailed explanation of how your affiliate products can help your readers solve their issues.


 	List Posts. These posts target users who are ready to take action and purchase the best products available (including yours).

Tactic 6. Leverage the Generative AI Wisely
79.3% of affiliate marketers are creating content with AI tools, and for good reason. The benefits of AI content generation are endless. 

Tools like ChatGPT or Jasper let you produce large Affiliate SEO content volumes while putting less time and effort into it. However, the quality of mass-produced AI content is poor, to say the least.

If you don't want Google to take your site down from SERPs and lose your audience's trust, generate informative and valuable content by following our tips below:

 	Have somebody proofread it. A little human touch never hurts. If AI content generation has become a routine part of your SEO affiliate marketing strategy, ask somebody on your team to proofread it. 
 	“Feed” AI with useful info. Create a portfolio of your product with a detailed description of its features, benefits, pros, cons, etc. The more info you’ve got, the more precise and original output you’ll get. Just send it to AI before running any other commands.
 	Use detailed and high-quality prompts. Describe tone of voice, structure and other nuances you want AI to include in your post. This will take you a step ahead from your competitors who rely on generic prompts.
 	Cut down the fluff. Nobody wants to read about the “ever-changing digital world” or “innovative solutions.” Get straight to the point and remove all the repetitive constructions that AI loves to use.

Tactic 7. Automate Your Outreach Campaigns
Google says that backlinks are not essential, but statistics prove the opposite.

The top-ranked pages have 3.8x more backlinks than lower-ranked ones.

So, if you want your affiliate marketing sites to appear on the first pages of search results, get high-quality backlinks from reputable sources in your niche. Usually, you need to email website owners, explaining how your content can benefit their readers and asking for a backlink.

Sounds a bit time-consuming, doesn't it? You’re right. We’ve just described the basic outreach strategy. And it’s not as effective as using automated solutions.

The market is filled with advanced multi-channel outreach tools that are waiting for you to explore. What are they? Just as the name implies, multi-channel outreach software lets you send pitches to potential partners via various channels, such as social media, instant messengers and email. If you’re looking for a simpler option, play around with an automated outreach feature provided by LinkedIn.
Tactic 8. Publish Guest Posts on Niche-Relevant Sites
We’ve been around for years in SEO for affiliate marketing, and so has guest posting. But if you can do it right, why not resort to it? With our proven tips, you’ll reap all the benefits that guest blogging has to offer.

 	Pick niche-relevant sites. That’s where your potential buyers are looking for fresh and valuable information. 
 	Sprinkle relevant links to your blog or landing page throughout the post (but not your affiliate links; most website owners don’t like that). Another good place to put these links is an author bio.
 	Create special offers for visitors who come from your guest post.

The Impact of Recent Google Updates on Affiliate Marketing SEO 
Google updates are hard to keep up with, even for SEO affiliate professionals. In the past five years, it has rolled out 36 major algorithm updates, which have affected SEO rankings for all websites out there, including ours (and yours too)

We did a bit of homework to walk you through the recent changes in Google’s algorithm that have a direct impact on the SEO affiliate marketing landscape:

 	March 2024 core algorithm update. Google has started penalizing websites with poor-quality AI generated content. However, experts say that this change affects only websites with purely AI generated content. If you’re mixing it with human-written content (or edit it like we do), you’re safe.
 	November 2023 update. If your blog’s content is primarily product reviews, Google will go through them all. SEO affiliate sites that don’t meet Google’s quality guidelines may see a drop in their rankings. 
 	September 2023 Helpful content update. This one deals with “fake” content updates and sites that host third-party content that has nothing to do with the site’s main focus.

Feel free to mix, tweak, and experiment with the best SEO strategies to see what works for your site. Still, we recommend using all of them if you’re ready for huge traffic volumes and conversions.

10239,Everything about postback conversion tracking method,"You've probably heard the term ""postback conversion tracking"" thrown around. It might sound a bit technical, but don't worry - I'm here to break it down for you. Postback conversion tracking is a powerful tool that can help you understand how well your marketing campaigns are doing, and in this article, we'll explore everything you need to know about it:

 	What postback conversion tracking entails
 	Situations where postback tracking proves beneficial and why
 	A step-by-step guide to implementing postback tracking
 	Best practices for maintaining data privacy and regulatory compliance
 	Tools and platforms to help you get started

So, let’s get into it.
What is Postback Conversion Tracking?
So, what exactly is postback conversion tracking? Think of it as a way to keep track of what happens after someone clicks on your ad. Instead of relying on the user's browser to send back information (which can be blocked or missed), postback tracking sends this data directly from your server to your tracking platform. This means you get more accurate and reliable information about conversions.
Why and When to Use Postback Conversion Tracking
Postback conversion tracking really shines in a few key scenarios. Let's look at some numbers to see why it's so valuable:

 	High-Risk Campaigns: Imagine you're launching a new product and spending big on ads. You need to know every single conversion. Postback tracking helps you get this data accurately. Businesses using accurate tracking methods see up to a 20% increase in ROI.
 	Mobile App Installations: Mobile advertising is huge. In fact, mobile ad spending is expected to reach $290 billion by 2025. Postback tracking ensures you capture all app installs and in-app actions, which is crucial when users might have ad blockers or different privacy settings on their devices.
 	Affiliate Marketing: Affiliates need to know they're getting paid for every conversion they drive. Postback tracking helps ensure no conversions are missed. For example, postback tracking can improve affiliate payout accuracy by 15-20% compared to pixel tracking.
 	International Campaigns: Running campaigns in different countries means dealing with various network conditions and browser behaviors. Postback tracking helps mitigate these discrepancies, ensuring you have consistent data.

Pros and Cons of Postback Conversion Tracking
Let's chat about the pros and cons, because no method is perfect.


Pros:

 	Accuracy: Postback conversion tracking doesn't rely on browser cookies, which can be blocked or deleted. This means you get more accurate data. According to industry reports, businesses see a 30% improvement in tracking accuracy with postback methods.
 	Reliability: Even if users have ad blockers, your tracking still works. This is huge because about 27% of internet users use ad blockers.
 	Security: Since data is sent server-to-server, it's harder for fraudsters to tamper with it. This added layer of security can reduce fraudulent activities by up to 25%.

Cons:

 	Complexity: Setting up postback tracking can be a bit more technical. You'll need to configure servers and URLs, which might require some help from your IT team.
 	Latency: Sometimes, there can be a slight delay in reporting because data is processed on the server. But hey, a small delay for more accurate data is often worth it.
 	Dependency on Servers: If your server goes down, so does your tracking. It's crucial to have reliable server infrastructure.


Postback vs. Pixel and Server-to-Server (S2S) Tracking: Which is Better?
Now, let's compare postback conversion tracking with other methods like pixel tracking and server-to-server (S2S) tracking.



Method
Description
Advantages
Disadvantages


Pixel Tracking
Uses browser cookies to track user actions.
Similar to postback but involves direct communication between advertiser’s and affiliate’s servers.
A form of S2S tracking focused on recording conversions and user actions directly from the server.


Server-to-Server (S2S) Tracking
Super easy to implement. Just add a snippet of code to your website.
 Very accurate and secure, perfect for complex setups.
Combines accuracy and security with a focus on conversion tracking.


Postback Tracking
Can be blocked by ad blockers, and cookies can be deleted. This can lead to a 10-15% loss in tracking data.
More complex to set up and requires deep integration.
Requires a technical setup, but generally more straightforward than full S2S integration.

How to Set Up Postback Conversion Tracking
Setting up postback conversion tracking in RedTrack is straightforward. Here's a detailed guide to help you get started:
Step 1: Generate Your Postback URL

 	Log in to RedTrack: Open your RedTrack account.
 	Go to the Campaigns Section: Click on the 'Campaigns' tab in the dashboard.
 	Create a New Campaign: Click 'New Campaign' to input your campaign details.
 	Generate Postback URL: During the campaign setup, RedTrack will provide you with a unique postback URL. This URL will capture conversion data.

Step 2: Implement the Postback URL
Now that you have your postback URL, you'll need to integrate it into your advertising platform or affiliate network.

 	Log in to Your Ad Platform: Access the platform where your ads are managed (e.g., Taboola, Outbrain).
 	Find Conversion Tracking Settings: Locate the settings for conversion tracking. This is usually found under tools or settings.
 	Insert the Postback URL: Paste the postback URL from RedTrack into the appropriate field for server-to-server (S2S) or postback tracking.

Step 3: Test the Setup
Before launching, it's important to test your setup to ensure accuracy.

 	Send Live Clicks: Generate a few live clicks from your traffic channel using the Campaign Click URL. Live clicks are necessary because test clicks do not contain a ref id, which is required for the postback to be sent to the traffic channel.
 	Find and Copy Click ID: Check the logs to locate the live clicks. Select one of the clicks and copy the Click ID and Ref ID data.
 	Create Test Conversion URL: Construct a URL in the following format and paste it into your browser: https://your_dedicated_tracking_domain/postback?clickid={replace_me_with_click_id_from_logs}.

 	Replace: your_dedicated_tracking_domain with your actual tracking domain. {replace_me_with_click_id_from_logs} with the Click ID from step 2. Example URL: http://club.rdtk.io/postback?clickid=5b6f7bfc2c822c5fad12d5bf.


 	Check for Conversion: Verify in your traffic channel that the conversion has been recorded.

Important!

 	Testing Limitations: A fake conversion can be created for testing postbacks with the traffic channel only.
 	Affiliate Network Testing: To test postbacks with your affiliate network, contact your network account manager. Some networks provide postback testing options within their settings.

Step 4: Monitor and Optimize
Once your postback conversion tracking is active, ongoing monitoring and optimization are essential.

 	Monitor Data: Regularly review your RedTrack dashboard to track conversion data and performance metrics.
 	Optimize Campaigns: Use the insights from RedTrack to refine your campaign settings, targeting, ad creatives, or bidding strategies based on the performance data.
 	Conduct Regular Audits: Periodically review your postback tracking setup to ensure accuracy and resolve any data discrepancies.

Step 5: Ensure Data Privacy and Compliance
Maintaining data privacy and compliance with regulations like GDPR and CCPA is crucial. RedTrack provides tools to help you manage this.

 	Data Minimization: Collect and store only the data necessary for tracking conversions. RedTrack allows you to adjust your data collection settings.
 	Obtain User Consent: Ensure you get explicit consent from users before tracking their actions. Use clear privacy policies and consent forms.
 	Secure Data Transmission: RedTrack uses HTTPS to encrypt data between servers, protecting it from breaches.



By following these steps, you can effectively set up postback conversion tracking in RedTrack. This setup will provide accurate conversion data, helping you make better-informed decisions to improve your campaign performance and return on investment.
Ensuring Data Privacy and Compliance with Postback Tracking

 	Data Minimization: Only collect and store the data you absolutely need for tracking conversions. This reduces risk and helps comply with privacy laws.

10311,How to identify successful CPA Offers,"You don't need luck to find a great offer. Instead, a level-headed approach helps you sift through enticing high payouts and alluring terms, focusing on what truly matters.

Understanding how to identify the right offers can vary between beginners and seasoned pros. Experts from CPA network often recommend starting with the offer and then selecting the traffic type. In contrast, beginners should focus on mastering one traffic source and testing offers within a single vertical to reduce complexity and make learning more manageable.
Steps to Identifying the Right CPA Offer

Step 1: CPA Network or Direct Partnership
Your first decision is whether to seek offers through a CPA network or a direct affiliate program.

Ideal for beginners, CPA networks offer a centralized platform where multiple advertisers post their offers, allowing for a wide variety of choices and simplified deal management. These networks provide security in payments and standardized monitoring of conversions. The key is to select a reputable network with a good track record. Once you choose a network, make sure to establish a strong working relationship with your account managers. They are often the gatekeepers to premium offers and can provide critical insights into what works and what doesn’t.

For those who prefer more control and potentially higher margins, direct partnerships with advertisers might be the better route. This method allows direct communication with the advertiser, offering more room for negotiation on rates and terms. However, it requires a good understanding of the market and strong negotiation skills to secure beneficial terms.
Step 2: Know Where to Search
Identifying profitable CPA offers can sometimes feel like searching for a needle in a haystack, but knowing where to search can make this task significantly easier.
Offer Aggregators
Offer aggregators compile numerous CPA offers from various networks, functioning like a CPA search engine. They allow you to filter and sort offers by vertical, country, payout, and more, making it easier to compare and find the best options.
Forum Directories
These are goldmines of information. Affiliate marketing forums not only list CPA networks but also provide reviews, success stories, and user experiences. They are hubs of shared knowledge where affiliates exchange tips and advice.
Search Engines
You can also find CPA offers by searching online. Queries like ""affiliate programs"" yield numerous opportunities. But sometimes it is better to get advice from experts. That's why we recommend trying the iMonetizeIt platform! 

iMonetizeIt has unique Smartlinks and CPA offers with a wide range of exclusive offers from direct advertisers. It's a user-friendly platform that offers the best conditions for every partner: an individual approach to payment, a helpful and qualified support team, and effective tools for work.

 	Worldwide GEO;
 	All types of traffic: app, native, banner, push and many others;
 	Database of free creatives and pre-lands;
 	Individual payments for media buy traffic.

Sign up here and get the best opportunities for monetization!
Step 3: Build Strong Relationships for Better Offers
Gaining access to the most lucrative and exclusive offers in affiliate marketing often hinges not just on your performance, but on the strength of your relationships within the network. Here’s how to build and maintain these critical connections effectively.

Not all offers are made public, as networks and advertisers typically reserve their best deals for affiliates they trust and value highly. These exclusive offers often come with better rates, favorable terms, and less saturation, allowing for higher profitability and easier scaling. Accessing these deals requires more than just a functional relationship with the network; it demands a proactive, strategic approach to relationship-building.
Volume
Networks and advertisers value affiliates who can deliver substantial and consistent traffic volumes because it simplifies their operations and ensures a steady flow of business. Demonstrating your ability to generate stable profits and achieve success consistently can significantly enhance your credibility and reliability in the eyes of the network. This might involve sharing performance data that highlights your track record, discussing past campaign successes, or outlining your strategies for maintaining and scaling traffic volumes.
Traffic Quality
The quality of traffic is paramount. Networks are vigilant in their efforts to monitor traffic quality to prevent fraud and ensure compliance with advertiser demands. To maintain high standards, invest in acquiring traffic from reputable sources and continuously monitor and optimize the quality of your leads. Implementing rigorous tracking measures and conducting regular audits of your traffic sources can help you identify and address potential issues before they affect your relationship with the network.
Personal Relationships
Building personal relationships with network account managers and key contacts within advertising firms can open doors to negotiations that are not available through formal channels. These relationships can be fostered through regular communication, responsiveness to requests, and proactive discussions about market trends and new opportunities.


Step 4: Evaluate the Offer
Before committing to an offer, evaluate its viability. Some offers, especially from reputable companies, convert better and simplify your job. Check how many affiliates are running the same offer and their success rates.

Thoroughly evaluating the potential of a CPA offer is crucial before committing resources to it. This step involves several layers of analysis to determine the offer's viability and potential profitability.
Legal Issues
Different countries have varying regulations concerning advertising, especially for sensitive products like pharmaceuticals, financial services, and cryptocurrencies. It is imperative to understand these regulations to avoid legal repercussions and ensure your marketing practices comply with local laws.

Certain products require additional certifications or compliance checks before they can be marketed in specific regions. Make sure that the products you're promoting meet all the necessary regulatory standards to prevent any legal issues.
Country &amp; Language
The effectiveness of an offer can greatly depend on how well it resonates with the local culture and language. Ensure that you have the resources to adapt your marketing materials to the target audience's language and cultural context effectively.

Be mindful of cultural sensitivities and taboos in the target market. What works in one country can be ineffective or even offensive in another.
Seasonality
Many products have seasonal peaks and troughs. For example, travel-related offers might peak during summer and winter holidays, while fitness products may see a surge around New Year’s. Timing your promotions to coincide with these peaks can significantly boost your success.

Stay updated with the latest market trends related to your offer. For instance, an increase in remote work might boost demand for home office supplies. Utilizing such trends can give you a competitive edge.
Step 5: Check the Conditions
Payouts
While high payouts are attractive, they shouldn’t be the only factor. Assess the payout structure - does it align with your cost per acquisition? Ensure that the earnings potential justifies the effort and cost involved.
Minimum Withdrawal
High minimum withdrawal limits can be a bottleneck, especially for affiliates testing multiple offers. They can tie up funds and impact cash flow, which is crucial for scaling new campaigns.
Accepted Ad Formats and Traffic Types
Verify that the offer accepts your main traffic sources and ad formats. Restrictions on traffic types like email, social, or search can limit your ability to promote the offer effectively.
Capping or Conversion Limits
Some offers impose daily or monthly caps on conversions, which can restrict earnings, especially if your campaign is capable of generating high traffic volumes. If possible, negotiate with the network to increase or remove these caps based on your past performance and reputation.
Step 6: Test
After selecting a few offers, it's time to test them. Use a detailed media buying template to guide your testing process.

Affiliate marketing success hinges not only on advertising skills but also on the quality of offers. The best offers, though hard to find, can significantly boost your profits. Building strong, long-lasting relationships with offer providers is essential. This guide offers a starting point, but diligent effort and relationship-building are key to finding the most lucrative offers.

10335,How machine learning is changing the way we track ads,"Every dollar spent on advertising should bring a return. But with so many marketing channels and touchpoints, figuring out which ads actually lead to sales can be tough. Traditional attribution models often miss the mark, leaving marketers unsure of where to invest.

This is where machine learning comes in. It analyzes large amounts of data to uncover patterns we might miss, providing deeper insights into customer journeys. In this post, we’ll look at how machine learning is changing ad attribution, helping you make better decisions, optimize your campaigns, and boost your ROI.

Let’s dive in!
What is ad attribution?
Ad attribution refers to the process of determining the user actions that led to the desired outcome between the click of the ad and the conversion. It's figuring out what ad led to a desired action (like sign-up, link clicks or purchase). 

For instance, if you generated a sign-up, attribution is about retracing your new lead’s steps with tools to figure out where they came from. With that knowledge, you can determine your most and least profitable channels. 

Similarly, accurate ad attribution is critical for marketers because it helps them understand the effectiveness of your marketing campaigns and optimize them for better results.
Types of ad attribution models
Marketing attribution models help you figure out which ads and interactions work. They show you what led to a sale, sign-up, or other desired action. This way, you can see what's really making your marketing efforts successful and make better decisions. 

Generally speaking, there are 6 main ad attribution models, each with its approach to assigning credit to different touchpoints. They are:
First-touch attribution model
The first touch attribution model is one of the most straightforward methods for assigning credit to different touch points along a customer’s journey. In this model, all the credit for a conversion is given to the very first interaction that a customer has with your brand. 

It's especially relevant when looking at first-click data to identify the channels driving initial engagement, as explained in the context of broader marketing attribution strategies. For example, if they first click on an ad or visit your website, that gets the credit

The best part? It's super easy to understand and use, making it a great starting point for businesses new to attribution modeling.

If your focus is on how well your marketing sparks initial interest and awareness, this model is especially effective. It works best for businesses where customers typically make quick decisions after their first contact, making it perfect for short sales cycles.
Last-touch attribution model
The last-touch attribution model takes a different approach by giving all the credit to the final interaction that led to a conversion. Instead of focusing on the first touchpoint, it zeroes in on the last action a customer takes before making a purchase.

This model is commonly used in platforms like Facebook, where attribution often centers on the last-click data, highlighting the final steps before a conversion.

This model is particularly valuable when your goal is to understand the direct actions or touchpoints that trigger conversions. It’s well-suited for businesses with quick, straightforward sales cycles, where customers typically make a purchase shortly after their last interaction.
Linear attribution model 
The linear attribution model is a fair and balanced way to give credit to all the touchpoints a customer interacts with. Unlike models that give all the credit to just one interaction, linear attribution splits the credit evenly among all touchpoints. This shows how each interaction works together to lead to a sale or sign-up, giving you a more complete picture.

It’s an approach that aligns well with the need to manage and analyze data from various sources, ensuring a holistic understanding of campaign effectiveness.

It is perfect for seeing the big picture of your customer's journey. It helps you understand how all the different touchpoints work together to drive sales or sign-ups. This model is especially useful for businesses with simple customer journeys and multiple marketing channels, as it clearly shows what's working and what's not.
Time-decay attribution model 
The time decay attribution model is a smarter way to give credit to touchpoints. It knows that the interactions closest to the sale or sign-up are usually the most important, so it gives them more credit. This model understands that the further along a customer is in their journey, the more impact each touchpoint has on their decision.

This model is perfect when you want to balance recognizing the impact of recent interactions and acknowledging the role of earlier touchpoints. It's especially useful for businesses with straightforward customer journeys, where the influence of touchpoints grows stronger as customers near a decision. 
Position-based attribution model
The position-based attribution model (also called the U-shaped model) gives credit to touchpoints in a balanced way. It prioritizes the first and last interactions but also recognizes the importance of the middle steps. This model is ideal for businesses that want to emphasize both the initial spark that grabs customers' attention and the final push that leads to a sale or sign-up.
Data-driven attribution model
This model is an advanced approach that uses data analytics and machine learning to precisely measure the impact of each touchpoint on sales or sign-ups. If your business is themed with complex customer journeys, this model is perfect for you—where multiple interactions influence the final decision. This model provides the most accurate picture of what's driving conversions.

If you have the necessary data and resources, this model can offer valuable insights that simpler models can't, helping you improve your marketing strategy.
Challenges in traditional ad attribution
Attribution is key to understanding the customer journey and measuring the effectiveness of PPC advertising. It's about identifying and crediting the touchpoints that lead to a conversion. However, attribution comes with challenges that marketers must address to get an accurate picture.

These challenges includes:

 	Data fragmentation: Data is spread across many channels and platforms, making it hard to track and analyze.
 	Cross-device tracking: Customers use multiple devices, making it hard to track their journey.
 	Attribution models: Choosing the right model to credit touchpoints is tricky, as different models give different results.
 	Offline conversions: Connecting offline sales to online touchpoints is tough.
 	Ad fraud: Fake clicks and traffic mess up attribution results.

Furthermore, to overcome these challenges, you can:

 	Consolidate data
 	Track devices
 	Choose the right attribution model
 	Connect offline sales
 	Stop ad fraud (if involved)

How machine learning drives sales
Machine learning improves ad attribution by providing a more accurate understanding of how ads drive sales. Here’s how:
Data handling and integration
Data handling and integration refer to the process of collecting, processing, and combining data from multiple sources into a unified view, enabling organizations to consolidate data, eliminate silos, and improve accuracy and insights.

In attribution, it helps link customer interactions across touchpoints and devices, providing a comprehensive view of the customer journey for accurate attribution.

Machine learning algorithms handle and integrate vast amounts of data from multiple sources, providing a complete and accurate picture of the customer journey. This includes:

 	Collecting data from various touchpoints, such as social media, search engines, display ads, email marketing, and offline interactions;
 	Integrating data from different platforms, like CRM systems, mobile apps, and websites;
 	Processing large volumes of data in real-time, ensuring timely insights;
 	Identifying patterns and connections between data points, revealing how each touchpoint influences the customer's decision;
 	Enhancing the accuracy of ad attribution by considering all relevant data points.

Pattern recognition and insights
Pattern recognition and insight refers to the ability of machine learning algorithms to identify complex patterns and connections in data, uncovering hidden relationships and revealing actionable insights that inform business decisions and optimize customer experiences.

By applying machine learning to customer journey data, businesses can gain valuable insights into:

 	Intricacies of customer behavior, including preferences, interests, and decision-making processes;
 	Correlations between specific touchpoints, channels, and customer actions;
 	Underlying factors driving conversions, sales, or other desired outcomes;
 	Areas of friction or drop-off points in the customer journey.

With these insights, businesses can inform data-driven decisions, optimize marketing strategies, and improve ROI.
Predictive analytics
Fueled by machine learning, predictive analytics enables businesses to predict future customer behaviors and trends with remarkable accuracy. By leveraging this capability, companies can:

 	Anticipate customer needs and preferences;
 	Identify new opportunities and potential risks;
 	Optimize marketing strategies for maximum impact;
 	Stay ahead of the competition with forward-looking insights.


Benefits of machine learning in predictive ad attribution
Implementing machine learning in predictive ad attribution offers several benefits, including:
Increased accuracy
Machine learning algorithms increase accuracy in ad attribution by analyzing vast datasets, identifying subtle patterns, and pinpointing the most influential touchpoints. This leads to a deeper understanding of customer journeys, allowing for data-driven decisions to optimize marketing strategies and improve ROI. 

As a result, businesses can accurately attribute conversions and sales, understand customer behaviors and preferences, and make informed decisions to maximize their marketing impact.
Real-time adjustments
Machine learning enables real-time analysis, allowing businesses to respond promptly to changes in customer behavior, adjust campaigns on the fly, and capitalize on emerging opportunities.
Cost efficiency
Businesses can allocate their budgets more efficiently by accurately identifying the most effective marketing efforts, reducing wasted spend and maximizing ROI.
Scalability
Machine learning solutions can scale seamlessly with growing marketing efforts, handling increasing data and complexity without compromising performance or accuracy.

Real-Life Examples of Machine Learning in Ad Attribution
In this section, you'll discover how top brands use machine learning to optimize their ad attribution. From personalized recommendations to optimized marketing budgets, these companies are achieving real results. 

The following companies are at the forefront of this innovation, successfully implementing machine learning for ad attribution and achieving remarkable results:
Amazon
E-commerce platforms like Amazon use CLV prediction to identify high-value customers. They can forecast future buying habits by analyzing purchase history, browsing behavior, and product reviews. 

With millions of products and a diverse customer base, Amazon sought to improve shopping experiences by making personalized product recommendations to its users, aiming to increase sales and customer satisfaction.

Amazon’s personalized recommendation engine has significantly contributed to its success by increasing user engagement and sales. The targeted suggestions make shopping more convenient for users, leading to higher conversion rates and enhanced customer loyalty.
Netflix
Netflix sought to enhance user engagement and reduce subscription cancellations by improving its ability to predict and influence viewer preferences. To achieve this, the company leveraged machine learning models to analyze vast amounts of viewer habits and preferences data.

Netflix trained models that refined content recommendations and informed promotional strategies by integrating viewer data, including watch history, search queries, and ratings. This enabled the company to tailor user interfaces and notifications to individual preferences, enhancing the viewing experience.

The implementation of machine learning at Netflix yielded significant improvements in user satisfaction and engagement, characterized by increased viewing sessions and reduced churn rates. Furthermore, the company's data-driven approach enabled strategic content creation, successfully releasing highly targeted original programming.
Mailchimp
Mailchimp doesn't only send emails. Analyzing metrics like open rates, click-through rates, and conversion rates can suggest optimal send times, content tweaks, or audience segmentation to ensure the best engagement for each campaign.
Nike
Nike collaborates with platforms like Facebook and Instagram to launch its new products. These platforms use machine learning to analyze user interests and behaviors, pinpointing long-distance runners. Nike then delivers personalized ads highlighting the shoe's benefits to this targeted group, resulting in increased engagement and efficient ad campaign performance.
Airbnb
Airbnb aims to understand the effectiveness of its diverse marketing channels in driving bookings. Through this method, they can trace the entire customer journey, from an initial touchpoint, such as a Facebook ad, a Google search result, or an email campaign, to the final booking. This insight helps them optimize their marketing budget by focusing on the most impactful channels. 

Tools like Google Analytics assist businesses in comprehending the customer's path by showcasing the influence of various touchpoints, whether search ads, display ads, or other campaigns, in achieving desired conversions.
Common pitfalls, and how to avoid them
One common pitfall you should avoid is relying solely on historical data without considering current trends. Businesses should regularly update their machine learning models to reflect the latest data and market conditions.

Others include:

 	Not leveraging customer data: Analyze customer behavior and preferences to avoid missed opportunities.
 	Not integrating multiple data sources: Combine data sources like Netflix did to gain a comprehensive understanding.
 	Not testing and optimizing: Continuously analyze and adjust like Mailchimp to ensure optimal performance.
 	Not focusing on high-impact channels: Use tools like Google Analytics to identify effective channels like Airbnb did.

Final thoughts
Machine learning is transforming predictive ad attribution, offering as many business owners and marketing professionals that will leverage this powerful tool to enhance their marketing strategies. 

Machine learning provides increased accuracy, real-time adjustments, cost efficiency, and scalability by improving data handling, pattern recognition, and predictive analytics. With these in place, businesses can achieve more precise and effective ad attribution, driving better marketing outcomes.

The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) were created to give people greater power over personal information. Both regulate how companies collect and use individuals’ personal data.

While both laws are focused on user privacy rights and putting control over one’s data back into the users’ hands, there are a few crucial differences between the two regulations beyond just their jurisdiction.
GDPR
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a comprehensive data privacy law that applies across the European Union. It empowers EU residents to take control of their personal information and streamlines data protection rules for global businesses. Notably, GDPR's reach extends beyond EU borders, requiring companies worldwide to comply if they handle EU residents' data. The regulation went into effect on May 25, 2018.

GDPR has key principles that impact tracking, requiring organizations to:

 	Collect personal data for a specific purpose;
 	Obtain explicit consent from individuals;
 	Delete or anonymize data when no longer needed.

Additionally, GDPR gives individuals rights regarding their data, including:

 	Access to their data;
 	Correction or deletion of their data;
 	Receiving a copy of their data.

Organizations must also have a documented legal reason for handling personal data and be transparent about handling collected data, including tracking purposes and methods.
CCPA
On the other hand, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) is a state-wide data privacy law that regulates how organizations handle California residents' personal information. Though passed in 2018, it went into effect on January 1, 2020, and has since been expanded and amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA).

Key aspects of the CCPA include:

 	Giving California residents the right to know what personal information a business has collected and how it's used and shared;
 	Allowing consumers to opt out of the sale or sharing their personal information with third parties;
 	Requiring companies to obtain consent to collect and use sensitive or children's personal data;
 	Mandating businesses to delete a consumer's personal information upon request.

Differences and similarities between GDPR and CCPA
Despite shared goals, they have distinct differences in scope, requirements, and enforcement. Understanding these similarities and differences is crucial for global and California-based organizations to ensure data privacy compliance.

Both CCPA and GDPR require businesses:

 	To disclose what personal information the businesses have compiled about those individuals;
 	To divulge what they do with the personal data;
 	Which holds personal data to delete that data upon request of the person the data pertains to;
 	To put in place cybersecurity measures to protect individuals' personal data;
 	To pay fines for non-compliance.

How GDPR and CCPA are different

 	GDPR requires companies to have a legal basis before processing data about residents, while CCPA does not
 	GDPR applies to all businesses that meet the legal basis requirement mentioned above. CCPA applies only to businesses with an annual gross revenue of over $25 million.
 	Under CCPA, an individual can keep companies from selling their private data, and organizations cannot discriminate against these individuals.
 	GDPR imposes additional conditions for companies processing health-related information because it is more specific and includes terms such as “genetic data” and “biometric data.” CCPA uses a general umbrella term.

In general, GDPR fines are likely higher than CCPA fines. However, CCPA opens the door for civil litigation, which could prove just as costly to an offending organization.

Challenges in privacy-centric ad tracking
When it comes to online ads, it's challenging to find a balance between showing people what they want and respecting their privacy. 

Here are 6 key things to consider to get it right:

 	Data collection restrictions: Collect only necessary data to achieve your advertising goals, avoid sensitive information, and implement data minimization techniques.
 	User consent requirements: Before collecting data, obtain explicit, informed, and voluntary consent by clearly explaining the purposes and usage.
 	Data transparency and user control: Disclose data collection and usage practices, providing users access to their data and easy-to-use tools to manage preferences.
 	Data security and protection: Implement robust security measures to protect collected data, ensuring encryption, pseudonymization, or anonymization.
 	Compliance with regulations: Adhere to data protection laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), staying up-to-date with changing regulations and guidelines.
 	Balancing ad effectiveness and user privacy: Use privacy-friendly ad targeting methods, avoid invasive tracking, and regularly assess your strategy to ensure balance.

Key components of privacy-centric ad tracking
Effective online advertising requires reaching the right people with the right message. But with growing concerns about data privacy, it's essential to do it in a way that respects your customers' boundaries. Finding this balance is key to building trust and achieving your marketing goals.

To get it right, keep the following in mind:

 	Consent management platforms: Get users' permission before tracking them. This means clearly explaining what data you'll collect and how you'll use it and giving them a simple way to opt in or opt out.
 	Anonymization and pseudonymization techniques: Hide users' identities by masking or encrypting their data. This way, even if data is shared or accessed, it can't be linked back to individual users.
 	Secure data storage and encryption practices: Lock down data to prevent unauthorized access. This includes using secure servers, encrypting data in transit and at rest, and regularly updating security protocols.

It's also important to consider data minimization—collecting only necessary data to achieve your advertising goals, transparency—making it easy for users to understand what's happening with their data, and user control.
Developing compliance strategies
Data privacy isn't a one-time task—it's an ongoing process. By regularly checking in and updating your practices, you can ensure you're always treating customer data with the care it deserves. To get this right, make privacy a top priority in your company. This means you create a culture where everyone understands the importance of keeping customer data safe.

Think of it like a regular health check for your company. Privacy rules change often, so regularly update your policies to stay on track. This means staying up-to-date with the latest regulations and making sure your policies reflect those changes.

It's also crucial to regularly check your practices. This means ensuring you're doing what you say you're doing regarding data privacy. Ask yourself questions like: Are we handling data correctly? Are we being transparent with customers?

By taking a proactive and transparent approach to data privacy, you build trust with your customers, avoid issues down the line, and maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace.


Tools and technologies for privacy-centric ad tracking
As a business, you want to reach your target audience effectively while also respecting their privacy. To do this, you need the right tools and technologies to help you get it right. This means finding solutions that balance effective advertising with user trust and transparency. 

To help you achieve this balance, here are some key tools and technologies to consider for privacy-centric ad tracking:
Privacy-focused analytics and tracking tools
These analytics and tracking tools are essential for understanding your audience without compromising privacy. Look for tools that prioritize user privacy, such as those that anonymize data to prevent individual identification, offer opt-out options for users to control their data sharing, and comply with data protection regulations like GDPR and CCPA.

A good example of a privacy-focused analytics and tracking platform is RedTrack, a privacy-friendly analytics tool that helps you understand your audience without compromising their data. It:

 	Anonymizes data to keep users private;
 	Lets users opt out of data sharing;
 	Follows GDPR and CCPA rules;
 	Gives you detailed insights into user behavior;
 	Tracks conversions and attribution across multiple channels;
 	Offers customizable reporting and dashboards;
 	Integrates with popular marketing tools and platforms.

Others include:

 	Google Analytics (with anonymization features enabled);
 	Matomo (a fully anonymizable analytics platform);
 	Fathom Analytics (a simple, GDPR-compliant analytics tool);
 	Mixpanel (with data anonymization and opt-out features);
 	Segment (with built-in data governance and privacy controls).

Machine learning
Leverage machine learning to enhance compliance and data protection. For example, machine learning can help detect and prevent data breaches or identify areas where your data handling practices can improve.
Third-party solutions
Integrate with third-party solutions that prioritize user privacy. This could include ad platforms, data management tools, or other technologies that help you reach your target audience while respecting their boundaries.
Future trends in privacy and ad tracking
Data privacy awareness has grown significantly, leading to governments introducing laws like GDPR and CCPA. Companies are responding by adding privacy features and changing their business models. As data protection continues to be a priority, what's next in 2024-2025? Here are the top 5 future trends to look out for:

 	Increased use of privacy-focused browsers: Privacy-focused browsers like Brave, Firefox, and Safari will continue to gain popularity, leading to a shift in how users interact with online advertising and tracking.
 	Rise of cookieless tracking: The phase-out of third-party cookies will drive the adoption of alternative tracking methods, forcing companies to rethink their data collection and targeting approach.
 	Advancements in privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs): PETs will improve data protection in ad tracking, enabling companies to collect and analyze data while maintaining user privacy and security.
 	Stricter regulations and enforcement: More stringent regulations and increased fines for non-compliance will drive investment in privacy compliance and risk management, leading to more transparency and accountability in ad tracking practices.
 	Growing adoption of consent management platforms (CMPs): CMPs will become essential for managing user consent and preferences, providing a seamless and transparent experience for users, and helping companies comply with regulations.

In line with these trends, user trust has become a crucial element in digital marketing, driven by increasing concerns about data privacy, security, and transparency. As users become more aware of how their data is being collected, shared, and used, they demand more control and agency over their personal information. The rise of ad blockers and the introduction of regulations like GDPR and CCPA reflect this shift towards user-centric marketing.

Recent social media scandals have further eroded user trust, making it essential for marketers to prioritize transparency, accountability, and data protection. Trust has become a key differentiator for brands, enabling them to build strong relationships, improve brand reputation, and drive long-term success. It's now very crucial for marketers to focus on creating customer-centric experiences, prioritizing user needs, and communicating clearly about data usage. 
Conclusion
Ensuring privacy is actually profit. Companies that put user privacy first build trust, avoid legal trouble, and attract loyal customers. It’s not just about compliance; it's a smart business strategy. By putting this in place, businesses can stay compliant, and boost their reputation. This leads to strong customer relationships, avoided penalties, and a competitive edge. Remember, user privacy is an ongoing effort. By making it a priority, businesses can achieve long-term success and customer loyalty.

10371,Why browser fingerprinting could be messing with your data,"As a marketer, understanding user behavior across multiple devices is crucial for effective marketing. As privacy regulations tighten and cookies decline, browser fingerprinting has become vital for tracking users. However, research reveals that 85.5% of users express concern about browser fingerprinting, while 78.5% emphasize the importance of protection from it.

In this article, we'll show you how browser fingerprinting helps with cross-device tracking, its benefits, and challenges. We'll also explore how this technique works, its advantages over traditional tracking methods, and the concerns surrounding its use.
What exactly is browser fingerprinting?
Browser fingerprinting (also called device fingerprinting or online fingerprinting) refers to tracking techniques that websites use to collect information about you by looking at the settings on their device and browser. This creates a unique ""fingerprint"" that identifies them. 

Unlike cookies, which can be deleted or blocked, this fingerprint stays the same even when you close your browser or turn off your device. It's like a digital signature that follows you online, making it hard to hide or change.

Additionally, сookies and fingerprinting are two different ways to track you online. A cookie is a piece of data from a website that is stored within a user’s web browser that the website can retrieve at a later time. They are likened to labels that websites attach to your browser, helping websites remember you and your preferences. The good news is that websites need your permission to use cookies, and you can delete them.

However, fingerprinting is different. It's like taking a picture of your browser's settings and habits. This picture, or ""fingerprint,"" is unique to you and can be used to identify you without your knowledge or consent. Unfortunately, you can't delete your fingerprint, and it can be used to build a detailed picture of your online life, even when you're in private browsing mode. 

When you visit a website, your browser sends information about your device and settings, such as:

 	Screen size and resolution;
 	Browser type and version;
 	Operating system and version;
 	Device type (desktop, mobile, tablet);
 	Browser settings (language, timezone, fonts);
 	Installed plugins and extensions.

Because browser fingerprints are unique to each device and browser combination, they can be used to track you across different devices. Even if you switch devices or browsers, your fingerprint can still be used to identify you.

In summary, browser fingerprinting is an effective tracking technique that uses your browser settings and device information to create a unique identifier that can be used to follow you around the web.
Why browser fingerprinting is useful for cross-device tracking 
Browser fingerprinting - though with certain downsides - helps track users across devices by creating a unique identifier for each device and browser combination. This allows trackers to match and link devices to the same user, creating a comprehensive profile. 

Additionally, correlating IP addresses across devices can further confirm user identity. This enables trackers to build a unified user profile, allowing them to deliver targeted advertising, personalize content, detect fraud, and enhance user experience through seamless syncing, all without users' explicit consent.

This is relevant to marketing because it allows them to build a complete picture of a customer's journey by tracking their behavior across multiple devices and browsers. This is especially important in business today, where users switch. This matters for marketers (who want to understand user behavior better) because it enables them to:

 	See how users interact with their brand across multiple devices and browsers;
 	Identify patterns and preferences that inform targeted marketing strategies;
 	Measure the effectiveness of their campaigns across different channels;
 	Deliver personalized experiences that resonate with their audience.

Hence, without cookies, marketers would struggle to achieve this level of insight. Browser fingerprinting fills the gap by providing a reliable way to track users and understand their behavior.
The upside of using browser fingerprinting
Browser fingerprinting is an effective tool for marketers who want to understand their audience's behavior online. Unlike traditional tracking methods, fingerprinting provides a more accurate and consistent way to identify users across multiple devices and sessions. 

Here are the key benefits of using browser fingerprinting:
Better tracking accuracy 
Fingerprinting provides more reliable results compared to cookies, which can be easily blocked or deleted by users. Cookies are fragile and prone to errors, making them an unreliable choice for tracking because they:

 	Can be blocked or deleted by users, resulting in lost data and incomplete tracking;
 	Expire or get deleted between sessions, disrupting continuous tracking;
 	Are vulnerable to tampering, which can lead to inaccurate data.

In contrast, browser fingerprinting collects information directly from the browser and device settings, reducing the risk of data loss or manipulation ensuring more accurate tracking, consistent tracking, and reduced risk of data tampering, as fingerprinting doesn't rely on cookies.
Consistency over time
Fingerprinting also ensures consistent tracking across sessions, even when users switch devices or browsers. This is possible as the unique identifier created by fingerprinting remains the same, allowing marketers to connect user behavior across multiple touchpoints. Unlike cookies, which may expire or be deleted between sessions, fingerprinting provides a continuous view of user activity.
Staying compliant
When implemented correctly, browser fingerprinting can help marketers meet privacy regulations without storing data on users' devices. By collecting only necessary information and anonymizing data, fingerprinting can comply with privacy laws like GDPR and CCPA. This approach also respects users' privacy preferences, as no personal data is stored on their devices.
The downsides and challenges of browser fingerprinting 
Browser fingerprinting was invented to help keep our online data safe, but in many cases, it does the exact opposite. While browser fingerprinting offers several benefits, it also raises important concerns and challenges, such as:
Privacy concerns
Browser fingerprinting can be seen as invasive by some users, as it collects detailed information about their browser and device settings without their explicit consent. This perception can lead to mistrust and negatively impact user experience. Marketers must be transparent about their tracking methods and ensure they respect users' privacy boundaries.
People are getting smarter
As fingerprinting becomes more widespread, browsers and users are finding ways to block or avoid it. Browser extensions and settings can prevent fingerprinting, while some users may use VPNs or incognito modes to mask their online activity. Marketers must stay ahead of these developments to ensure their tracking methods remain effective.
Legal and ethical hurdles
Browser fingerprinting raises potential regulatory issues, as it may violate privacy laws. The GDPR in the EU and the CCPA in the US have both imposed rules that regulate the use of cookies for the protection of user privacy, with hefty fines for those who break them. Fingerprinting, on the other hand, is unregulated, which gives more freedom to those who collect this data.

Marketers must ensure they comply with these regulations and obtain necessary user consent. Moreover, fingerprinting raises ethical concerns, such as reinforcing existing biases or creating ""digital fingerprints"" that can be used for nefarious purposes. 
How to use browser fingerprinting responsibly 
Using browser fingerprinting can help marketers and businesses understand their users and target audience better, leading to a better user experience and more sales. However, if marketers aren’t careful, fingerprinting can also invade users' privacy and break the law.

To avoid these problems, there's a need to use fingerprinting responsibly - this means being honest with users, collecting only the data needed, and respecting users' wishes.

To maintain user trust and comply with privacy regulations, follow these guidelines for responsible browser fingerprinting:

 	Be transparent with users about how tracking works and what data is collected. Provide easily accessible opt-out options and ensure transparency throughout the tracking process.


 	Use fingerprinting wisely, avoid unnecessary data collection, and respect user boundaries. Prioritize user trust and regularly review tracking practices to ensure they align with user expectations and privacy regulations.
 	Combine fingerprinting with other privacy-friendly tracking methods, such as first-party cookies and user authentication, to minimize reliance on a single tracking method.

To minimize reliance on fingerprinting, consider combining it with RedTrack's first-party cookie-based tracking and user authentication. This approach allows for:

 	Enhanced accuracy: Fingerprinting fills gaps in cookie-based tracking, ensuring comprehensive user behavior data.
 	User control: First-party cookies and user authentication enable users to manage their data and opt-out if desired.
 	Privacy-friendly: RedTrack's focus on first-party data and user authentication aligns with privacy regulations and user expectations.

What's next for browser fingerprinting?
As technology advances and privacy laws become stricter, browser fingerprinting will likely evolve to adapt to these changes. Here are some possible developments to keep in mind:

 	Advancements in machine learning and AI could enable more sophisticated fingerprinting techniques, making it harder for users to evade tracking.
 	Integration with other tracking methods, such as device graphs and cross-device tracking, could create a more comprehensive picture of user behavior.
 	Browser developers may implement new privacy features, such as fingerprinting-blocking extensions or settings, to give users more control over their online data.
 	Companies may shift towards more privacy-friendly tracking methods, like first-party cookies or user authentication, to maintain consumer trust.

To strike a balance between effective tracking and respecting user privacy, companies must prioritize transparency and accountability, including:

 	Clearly disclosing tracking practices and obtaining user consent;
 	Providing users with controls to manage their data and opt-out of tracking;
 	Ensuring data security and protection;
 	Avoiding discriminatory practices and ensuring equal access to services.

In conclusion, digital marketing is always changing. To keep up, marketers need to understand their users better and browser fingerprinting is an effective tool for this. It helps marketers learn about user behavior and preferences. 

However, marketers must use it carefully and respect users' privacy. Here are some valuable tips to keep in mind:

 	Be transparent with users about what data you're collecting and how you're using it;
 	Use fingerprinting in moderation and balance it with other marketing strategies;
 	Prioritize user privacy and security when collecting and storing data;
 	Stay up-to-date with changing privacy laws and regulations;
 	Use fingerprinting to enhance user experience, not manipulate or deceive.

10376,Can ad tracking tools really boost your ROI?,"In modern marketing, advertisers constantly seek ways to maximize their ROI. However, measuring and optimizing ad performance remains a challenge due to the many channels and ad formats available, making it hard to know what's working and what's not.

Advertisers often find themselves figuring out how to effectively allocate their budget across various platforms, targeting options, and ad creative, while ensuring a positive return on investment.

Thankfully, this article shows you how to optimize your ROI with ad tracking and attribution software, refine your marketing strategies, and maximize your media buying efforts.
What is ad tracking and attribution software?
Tracking, in the context of ad tracking and attribution software, refers to the process of monitoring and recording user interactions with your ads, such as:

 	Clicks, when a user clicks on your ad;
 	Conversions, when a user completes a desired action, like making a purchase or filling out a form;
 	Impressions, when your ad is displayed to a user;
 	Engagements, when a user interacts with your ad, like watching a video or hovering over a display ad.

Ad tracking and attribution software helps you understand how your ads perform by tracking customer actions, such as clicks, conversions, and purchases, and attributing value to different touchpoints, like ads, channels, or campaigns, that contributed to a conversion.
Key features that help increase ROI 
Maximizing ROI is the ultimate goal of any marketing campaign. To achieve this, you need the right tools and insights to optimize your strategy and drive results. Here are key features to consider that can help increase ROI:
Real-time data
Real-time data provides instant access to granular metrics, such as click-through rates, conversion rates, and cost-per-acquisition, as they happen. This allows you to identify top-performing ad creative, targeting options, and bidding strategies, and quickly pivot from underperforming campaigns to allocate budget to winners. 
Cross-channel tracking
Understanding your customers' journey is crucial. Cross-channel tracking reveals where they're coming from, how they're interacting with your brand, and what drives conversions. 

By monitoring their path across all channels and devices, you can:

 	Identify touchpoints that influence conversions;
 	Optimize the customer journey for seamless experiences;
 	Allocate budget effectively across channels.

Fraud prevention
Here, you protect your ad budget from fraudulent activity with reliable detection and prevention measures ensuring valid traffic and engagement, accurate campaign performance metrics, and maximum ROI and minimal waste.
Better targeting
You can reach your ideal audience with precision targeting tools, ensuring your message resonates with those most likely to convert, leveraging:

 	Demographic and interest data: Target specific age groups, locations, interests, and preferences to ensure your message reaches the right people.


 	Behavioral insights: Analyze user behavior, such as browsing history and purchase patterns, to identify high-intent audiences and tailor your message accordingly.


 	Lookalike targeting: Identify new audiences that share similarities with your existing customers or high-performing audiences, expanding your reach while maintaining relevance.

Common mistakes and how to avoid them 
Regardless of product type, marketing strategy, and objectives, every marketer has something in common: we all want to know whether our efforts are moving the needle on sales. Yet data-driven marketing is only as strong as the insights it generates - you’d need to know how to interpret it correctly. 

Here are the essential tips to help you decode your metrics, and avoid common pitfalls:

 	 Understand your metrics: Know what each metric measures, how it's calculated, and ensure data accuracy, completeness, and consistency.
 	 Consider the context: Take into account external factors like seasonality, trends, or anomalies, and analyze data over time to identify patterns and changes.
 	 Get a comprehensive view: Look at multiple metrics and break down data into subsets to reveal insights hidden in aggregated data.
 	 Avoid common pitfalls: Avoid assuming cause-and-effect relationships between metrics and focus on metrics that drive business outcomes, not just impressive numbers.
 	 Evaluate performance accurately: Ensure your data sample is representative of your target audience and evaluate performance against industry standards, competitors, or internal benchmarks.

In addition, flexibility in choosing the right attribution model is crucial because different models serve different purposes and may be more suitable for specific marketing strategies, channels, or goals. A rigid approach can lead to inaccurate attribution, which in turn can result in suboptimal budget allocation and missed opportunities. 

Furthermore, being flexible allows you to:

 	Adapt to changing market conditions and customer behaviors;
 	Test and compare different models to find the best fit for your unique situation;
 	Account for cross-channel interactions and multi-touch journeys;
 	Refine your attribution strategy as your marketing mix evolves.

In the same vein, continuous analysis and tweaking of campaigns are essential for sustained ROI improvement. Markets and customer behaviors are constantly changing, so it's vital to:

 	Regularly assess campaign performance and attribution accuracy;
 	Identify areas for optimization and reallocate the budget accordingly;
 	Refine targeting, messaging, and creative assets to maximize impact.

10388,How to use tracking insights for better cross-channel marketing,"The foundation of solid marketing is understanding what makes your audience tick. 

But if you’re not tracking your efforts, you’re just making educated guesses. 

In this article, we’ll break down how tracking insights can help you see what’s really happening behind the scenes, spot trends, and focus your efforts where they matter most. 

This way, you’re not just reaching your audience - you’re actually connecting with them and growing your impact. Ready? 

Right this way… 
Why cross-channel marketing is crucial
Cross-channel marketing involves reaching and engaging your audience on multiple platforms, such as social media, email, search engines, and more. Each platform serves a specific purpose and provides different opportunities to connect with your audience. For example, your audience might discover your brand on Instagram, search for you on Google, and then decide to make a purchase after receiving an email campaign. 

Today's customer journey is not linear. A potential buyer may interact with your brand in several ways before converting - seeing an Instagram ad, researching on Google, then finally clicking through an email to make a purchase. 

Cross-channel marketing ensures you're consistently present throughout this journey, but keeping track of each touchpoint can be challenging without the right tools. That's where tracking insights come in: they provide a clear, data-driven view of how your audience moves between channels, helping you allocate resources effectively.

One of the biggest challenges in cross-channel marketing is managing multiple touchpoints. Each channel plays a different role in driving conversions, making it hard to know where to focus your efforts. 

Tracking insights address this by showing you which channels are performing best, which ones need improvement, and how they work together to influence your audience's decisions. With this information, you can optimize campaigns for maximum impact.
What are tracking insights?
Tracking insights refer to the data that reveals how customers engage with your brand across various marketing channels. This includes clicks, views, conversions, and more — essentially all the metrics that give you a full picture of customer interactions. 

These insights are crucial for understanding which channels and campaigns are most effective, allowing you to make data-backed decisions.
How do they help?
The value of tracking insights lies in their ability to break down complex data into actionable pieces. You can see at a glance which channels are driving conversions, where you’re losing customers, and how each platform contributes to your overall marketing goals. RedTrack simplifies this process by providing:

 	Real-time data aggregation and analytics;
 	AI-powered attribution modeling for precise ROI calculation;
 	Efficient integration with multiple marketing channels and platforms;
 	Customizable dashboards for tailored insights;
 	Automated reporting for streamlined decision-making.

How to use tracking insights to improve performance 
With tracking data, you can easily identify which channels are performing best. RedTrack’s attribution tools, for example, help you see whether social media, email, or search ads are driving the most conversions. 

Let’s say your tracking insights show that Instagram ads consistently outperform Google Ads in terms of conversion rate. This knowledge allows you to double down on Instagram while refining or reallocating your Google ad spend.

Once you've identified your top-performing channels, you can shift your budget to maximize ROI. If your data shows that Instagram is driving more conversions at a lower cost than Google, it’s clear where more of your budget should go. This approach ensures that you’re spending money where it counts, optimizing your marketing investment.

Different channels call for different strategies, and tracking insights can show you exactly what messaging resonates on each platform. 

For instance, the language that works in a Facebook ad might not perform well in an email campaign. By analyzing the data, you can adjust your content to align with each platform’s strengths, leading to more effective messaging across the board.


Keep your messaging consistent across channels
While it’s important to customize messaging for each channel, you also need to maintain a consistent brand voice. Your audience should recognize your brand and message whether they’re interacting with you on social media, via email, or through a display ad. 

Tracking insights help you achieve this consistency by showing how each campaign is performing in real-time. If one message performs particularly well across several platforms, you can replicate that success elsewhere.

Tracking data allows you to align your overall marketing strategy, ensuring that your messaging is cohesive across all touchpoints. 

For example, if your email campaign emphasizes a promotion that’s also being advertised on social media, tracking insights help you monitor whether these messages are aligned and effective. This creates a hassle-free experience for your audience, no matter where they encounter your brand.
Use attribution models
Attribution models help you understand which channels and touchpoints deserve credit for driving conversions. Different models offer different insights; first-click attribution credits the first interaction a customer has with your brand, while last-click attribution credits the final touchpoint before the purchase. 

Understanding these models is crucial to getting a full view of your customer journey and knowing which channels contribute most to your success. RedTrack takes attribution modeling to the next level by providing:

 	Data-driven attribution modeling;
 	Cross-channel tracking and analysis;
 	Customizable attribution workflows;
 	Real-time reporting and analytics;

With RedTrack, you can:

 	Track customer journeys across multiple touchpoints;
 	Assign credit to influential channels and campaigns;
 	Optimize budget allocation based on attribution insights;
 	Measure ROI accuracy with data-driven attribution.

Best practices for cross-channel marketing using tracking insights
Clicks are great, but they only tell part of the story. To run successful marketing campaigns, you need to understand how users interact with your content. Here's how to do it.
Use click ID for accurate attribution


Click IDs play a crucial role in tracking user interactions across multiple channels. Each user interaction generates a unique ID, allowing you to track their entire journey across different marketing channels (website, ads, social media). 

This lets you see exactly which channels are leading to conversions, giving you a clear picture of what's working and what needs tweaking.
Leverage 3rd-party data for deeper insights


Combining click ID data with external sources yields valuable insights into user behaviour. 

Imagine knowing if a user clicking your ad has previously interacted with your brand on Facebook; you can by integrating data sources like Facebook IDs, you gain a richer understanding of user behavior. This allows for more personalized marketing and more accurate tracking of your campaigns' effectiveness.
Utilize device and location information for optimization


It's important to understand that not everyone interacts with your content the same way. When you utilize data on user devices and location, you can refine your targeting. 

This means showing ads to the right people on the platforms they use most. You can also tailor your content based on where your audience is located, making your marketing more relevant and impactful.

In a nutshell, click IDs, 3rd-party data, and device/location information work together to give you a complete picture of your audience.
Final thoughts 
Effective tracking reveals valuable customer behavior insights, enabling data-driven decisions and optimization. While accurate tracking measures the impact of each touchpoint, refining the customer journey for maximum ROI.

10408,What is online behavioral advertising (OBA) and how to use it?,"Online behavioral advertising has become a cornerstone of modern digital marketing, offering personalized ads based on users’ online activity. It goes beyond traditional marketing by focusing on the user’s browsing behavior to deliver more targeted, relevant ads.

For instance, in affiliate marketing, OBA enables advertisers to target users who have shown interest in specific products or categories, increasing the likelihood of conversion. A user who browses travel websites, for example, may be served ads for hotel deals or vacation packages, making the advertising experience more relevant and useful.

In this article, we’ll explore:

 	What OBA is;
 	How it functions;
 	How you can leverage it to enhance your marketing strategy without alienating your audience.

Read on to learn more about how OBA works!
What is Online Behavioral Advertising?
Online Behavioral Advertising is an advanced marketing technique where ads are served to users based on their online behavior. This includes the websites they visit, their search queries, and the content they interact with. The goal is to display more relevant ads to their interests, increasing the likelihood of engagement.

Unlike traditional forms of advertising and advertising networks, which show the same message to everyone, OBA tailors the content specifically to the user’s habits.  

Furthermore, in 2025, online behavioral advertising is poised to dominate the digital space. Consumers' growing demand for personalized experiences drives this trend. In contrast to traditional ads, online behavioral advertising blends smoothly with content, offering direct messages based on individual user behavior, interests, and preferences.
How does OBA work?
Online Behavioral Advertising uses advanced technology to deliver personalized ads, shaping the online advertising landscape. But have you ever wondered what happens behind the scenes? How do ads seem to know exactly what you're interested in? Here's how: 
Tracking user behavior
At the heart of OBA are technologies like cookies, pixels, and device IDs. These tools track users’ online activities, such as:

 	Websites they visit;


 	Search queries they perform;
 	Content they view, click on or engage with.

By collecting and analyzing this data, OBA systems can build detailed profiles of user preferences and habits.
Data analysis
Once data is collected, it's analyzed to create a behavioral profile for each user. For example, if someone frequently visits websites about fitness and nutrition, their profile might indicate an interest in health-related products. This profile enables advertisers to display ads that resonate with the user’s preferences, leading to higher engagement.
Serving targeted ads
After building the profile, the user is placed into an audience segment based on their behavior. For instance, users interested in fitness may see ads for sports gear, health supplements, or workout apps when browsing the internet. This helps advertisers ensure that the right message reaches the right person at the right time.
Benefits of using OBA in your marketing strategy
OBA helps businesses show relevant ads to the right people. Here's how it can improve your marketing:
Better ad relevance
OBA ensures that users are shown ads that match their interests, significantly increasing the likelihood that they will engage with the ad. For example, a person interested in cooking might be shown ads for kitchen gadgets or meal delivery services, making the ad more appealing and relevant.
Improved ROI
Since OBA targets users based on their behavior, it generally results in better ad performance. Ads are more likely to convert because they align with the user’s interests, meaning businesses get more out of their marketing spend, ultimately improving ROI. 
Enhanced user experience
Nobody enjoys being bombarded with irrelevant ads. OBA improves the user experience by showing people ads they care about, rather than random ads that don’t relate to their preferences.
More efficient use of ad spend
OBA allows marketers to focus their ad budgets on the audiences most likely to convert, ensuring a higher return on investment. This efficiency makes it easier for businesses to maximize their advertising budget.
Common techniques used in online behavioral advertising
Online behavioral advertising has undoubtedly changed the way businesses connect with their target audience, offering unparalleled precision and effectiveness.

To maximize the potential of OBA, advertisers employ various techniques that cater to specific marketing goals and audience segments. Here are some common techniques used in online behavioral advertising:
Retargeting
Retargeting shows ads to users who have already interacted with your website but didn’t convert. For instance, if a user adds a product to their shopping cart but doesn’t complete the purchase, retargeting can serve them an ad reminding them of the item, potentially bringing them back to your site to finalize the sale.
Lookalike targeting
Lookalike targeting leverages behavioral data from your existing customers to find new users with similar online habits. This is particularly useful for expanding your customer base, as it helps you reach people who are likely to be interested in your products based on their behavior.
Interest-based targeting
This approach groups users into segments based on their browsing habits and interests, such as technology enthusiasts or fashion lovers. Advertisers can then serve highly relevant ads to these segments, increasing the chances of engagement.
Contextual targeting
Contextual targeting involves serving ads that align with the content a user is currently viewing. For example, if a person is reading an article about the best hiking trails, they might see ads for outdoor gear or hiking boots.
How to implement OBA in your campaigns: step-by-step
Online behavioral advertising helps you reach your target audience with precision and relevance. To get started, follow these practical steps to create effective OBA campaigns:
Step 1: Define your target audience
Begin by identifying the audience segments you want to reach. For example, if you sell fitness products, you might target health-conscious individuals or people who regularly search for exercise tips online.
Step 2: Set up tracking on your website
Use tracking tools like Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, or RedTrack to collect data on user behavior. These tools help you track how users interact with your site and gather valuable insights for creating behavioral profiles.
Step 3: Build behavioral profiles
Segment your audience based on their online activities. For example, users who frequently browse for running shoes can be placed into a “running gear” segment, while those searching for workout equipment might be placed into a “home workout equipment” segment.
Step 4: Create tailored ads for each segment
Develop customized ads that speak directly to each segment’s interests. For example, ads targeting frequent travelers might focus on travel-friendly products or services that make travel more convenient.
Step 5: Set up retargeting campaigns
Create retargeting campaigns to reach users who visited specific pages but didn’t complete an action, such as adding a product to their cart but not checking out.
Step 6: Monitor and optimize
Regularly review your campaigns and adjust targeting, messaging, and budgets based on performance data. Optimization is key to improving your results over time.
Challenges and risks of online behavioral advertising
While OBA enhances ad relevance, it also raises important concerns. Privacy, data accuracy, and over-personalization can impact user trust and advertiser success. Understanding these challenges is crucial for responsible and effective OBA practices:
Privacy concerns
Users may feel uncomfortable with the level of tracking involved in OBA. To mitigate this, be transparent about your data practices and ensure compliance with data privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA.
Data accuracy issues
Behavioral data isn’t always accurate. For example, users may browse on different devices, or they may use ad-blockers, which can prevent data collection.
Over-personalization
While personalization can improve relevance, too much of it can feel invasive. It’s important to strike a balance between tailoring ads to users and respecting their privacy.
Best practices for using OBA effectively
To get the most out of online behavioral advertising, it's essential to prioritize precision, transparency, and continuous improvement. Follow these recommended best practices to optimize your OBA campaigns, boost ROI, and foster a positive user experience:

 	Always get user consent: Ensure transparency in data collection and give users the option to opt out of behavioral tracking.


 	Segment thoughtfully: Avoid overly broad audience segments. The more specific your segments, the more relevant your ads will be.


 	Regularly review your data: Continuously check the accuracy and relevance of your behavioral data, adjusting your targeting as needed.


 	Keep testing and optimizing: Use A/B testing to evaluate different ad creatives, messaging, and targeting strategies. Optimize your campaigns based on performance.

How RedTrack helps simplify OBA campaigns
Managing online behavioral advertising campaigns can be complex. RedTrack makes it easier. With its powerful tracking and analytics tools, RedTrack helps advertisers understand their audience, optimize ads, and increase returns. Key features includes:

By focusing on relevance and respecting user privacy, you can create a win-win situation for both your audience and your brand.

10424,How to use server-side tracking to bypass ad blockers,"As digital advertising evolves, advertisers face a growing challenge: ad blockers. These tools are designed to block intrusive ads and protect user privacy, but they often have a significant downside for businesses that rely on online marketing. One of the most effective solutions to combat the negative effects of ad blockers is server-side tracking. This method bypasses traditional browser-based tracking systems and ensures that advertisers can collect accurate data.

In this blog, we’ll explore how server-side tracking works, why it’s effective, and how tools like RedTrack can help you implement it effectively.
Ad blockers and their impact on advertisers
Ad blockers are software programs or browser extensions designed to prevent unwanted ads and tracking scripts from running on a user’s device. They work by identifying and blocking requests to known ad servers and tracking domains, preventing these scripts from being downloaded and executed by the browser.

Users install ad blockers to eliminate distractions from ads, improve browsing speeds, and protect their privacy by blocking cookies and tracking scripts. While this improves the user experience, it creates challenges for advertisers and advertising networks who rely on collecting user data to run targeted campaigns. The widespread adoption of ad blockers, especially in regions with high tech-savvy audiences, makes it increasingly difficult for advertisers to track user behavior effectively.
Challenges for advertisers
When ad blockers are active, they can have significant consequences on advertisers’ ability to run effective campaigns. Some of the main challenges include:

 	Missing data: Ad blockers prevent tracking pixels and other tools from recording interactions like page views, conversions, and user behavior, leading to gaps in data.


 	Inaccurate attribution: With incomplete data, advertisers struggle to accurately attribute conversions to the right marketing efforts. This can skew the perceived effectiveness of campaigns and lead to poor optimization decisions.
 	Limited insights: Without access to full user behavior, advertisers lack the insights to make informed decisions about ad spending, audience targeting, and content optimization.

To combat the issues posed by ad blockers, many advertisers are turning to server-side tracking as a solution. Server-side tracking enables advertisers to collect data directly from their own servers, bypassing the user's browser entirely. This means that even if a user has an ad blocker enabled, the tracking data can still be captured and recorded accurately.
What is server-side tracking?
Server-side tracking operates by moving the tracking process from the user’s browser (client-side) to the advertiser’s own server. In traditional tracking methods, when a user clicks an ad or performs a conversion action, a tracking pixel or script is triggered within the browser, sending data back to the advertiser. However, ad blockers can detect and block these requests.

In server-side tracking, when a user interacts with your website, the relevant data (such as page visits, clicks, or conversions) is sent to your server. The server then forwards this information to your tracking system or analytics tool, effectively bypassing any browser-based restrictions. This means the data is captured regardless of whether the user has an ad blocker enabled.
Differences from traditional tracking
The key difference between server-side tracking and client-side tracking lies in where the tracking scripts are executed:

 	Client-side tracking: Scripts are run in the user’s browser. Tools like Google Analytics and Facebook Pixel are examples of client-side trackers. These scripts rely on the user’s browser to send data back to the server, making them vulnerable to being blocked by ad blockers.


 	Server-side tracking: The data collection happens on the advertiser’s server, not on the user’s device. Because the tracking script runs on the server, ad blockers cannot interfere with the process.

Why server-side tracking overcomes ad blockers
Ad blockers are specifically designed to block JavaScript-based tracking scripts from running on users’ browsers. These scripts include tracking pixels, analytics tools, and cookies that gather information about user behavior. Ad blockers identify and block these scripts by matching them to known tracking domains or patterns in the page’s code. This causes advertisers to lose valuable data about clicks, conversions, and user interactions because the scripts never run or report back to the server.
Server-side tracking bypasses this
Because server-side tracking shifts the entire tracking process to the advertiser's server, it sidesteps the browser entirely. Since ad blockers are focused on blocking client-side JavaScript files or third-party requests from the browser, they have no way to interfere with server-side communications.

Server-side tracking does not rely on the user's browser to collect data. Instead, when a user interacts with a website or app, the information is sent directly to the server. The server processes this data and sends it to the tracking systems. Since ad blockers cannot block data from being sent from the advertiser's server, server-side tracking ensures that no critical data is lost, even if a user has installed an ad blocker.
Advantages of server-side tracking
The transition to server-side tracking offers numerous benefits for advertisers, especially those impacted by the growing adoption of ad blockers. Here are some of the key advantages:
Complete and accurate data collection
With server-side tracking, advertisers can capture a complete set of data, including all interactions such as page views, clicks, and conversions. Because the tracking data is sent from the server instead of the user’s browser, ad blockers cannot disrupt the flow of information. This ensures that advertisers have access to the full picture of user behavior and campaign performance.
Improved attribution and insights
One of the biggest challenges with ad blockers is the loss of attribution data. Without knowing where conversions came from, it’s difficult to measure which campaigns are delivering the best results. Server-side tracking restores accurate attribution because all data points (even those blocked by ad blockers on the client side) are recorded at the server level. This gives advertisers better insights into their campaigns, helping them to optimize targeting, creative strategies, and budget allocations based on reliable data.
Enhanced campaign performance with RedTrack
By integrating server-side tracking into a performance-tracking platform like RedTrack, advertisers can further enhance their campaign optimization. RedTrack’s auto-optimization features use the complete data captured by server-side tracking to automatically allocate ad budgets to the best-performing channels. With this comprehensive data set, advertisers can refine their strategies more effectively, improve ROI, and minimize wasted ad spend.
Setting up server-side tracking with RedTrack
Now that we’ve established the benefits of server-side tracking, let’s walk through the steps to set it up using RedTrack, a leading performance tracking and analytics platform:
1. Enable server-side tracking
To enable server-side tracking within RedTrack, you can navigate to the dashboard and select the option to enable server-side tracking. RedTrack provides a simple and intuitive interface to activate this feature, ensuring that your campaigns will now be tracked from your server rather than relying solely on browser-based scripts.
2. Configure postback URLs
Postback URLs are essential for passing conversion data back to RedTrack from your server. Once server-side tracking is enabled, you'll need to set up postback URLs that send data from your server to RedTrack’s system. This ensures that all conversion data is recorded accurately, even when ad blockers are in place. RedTrack provides detailed guidelines on how to configure these URLs to avoid any tracking issues.
3. Link traffic sources
To ensure that all data flows seamlessly into RedTrack, it’s important to connect your ad networks and traffic sources. This involves integrating various platforms like Facebook, Google Ads, and affiliate networks with RedTrack to pull all tracking data together. By linking traffic sources, you can make sure that RedTrack receives updates about your campaigns, providing you with a centralized dashboard to monitor performance.
4. Test and monitor
Before going live, it’s important to thoroughly test your server-side tracking setup. This includes verifying that your postback URLs are configured correctly and checking that data is being collected as expected in the RedTrack dashboard. After launching your campaigns, continue to monitor the tracking setup regularly to ensure that RedTrack is pulling inaccurate data, especially as you add new traffic sources or update your campaigns.


Common mistakes to avoid 
While server-side tracking offers many benefits, it’s important to avoid some common mistakes during the setup process, such as:
Postback URL setup errors
One of the most frequent mistakes is incorrect configuration of postback URLs. If postback URLs aren’t properly set up, it can lead to data loss or inaccurate conversion tracking. Be sure to follow RedTrack’s guidelines closely when configuring postback URLs to ensure you don’t miss out on valuable conversion data.
Neglecting privacy compliance
Server-side tracking may bypass ad blockers, but it doesn’t bypass privacy regulations. Ensure that your tracking setup complies with data privacy laws like GDPR and CCPA. Obtain user consent where required, and be transparent about how data is collected and used.
Why server-side tracking is essential
Server-side tracking is no longer just a nice-to-have option for advertisers—it’s becoming essential for any data-driven business. Here’s why:
Accurate data collection despite ad blockers
As more users install ad blockers to prevent intrusive ads, advertisers must adopt new methods to ensure they don’t lose valuable data. Server-side tracking allows you to maintain full visibility into your campaigns by capturing data that would otherwise be blocked. With this solution, you can still track user interactions, even with ad blockers active.
RedTrack simplifies the process
RedTrack’s platform makes server-side tracking accessible and easy to set up, even for those without a technical background. The platform offers a simple process for enabling server-side tracking, configuring postback URLs, and monitoring data collection. It also provides real-time data reporting and automatic optimization features, allowing you to continuously improve your campaigns based on accurate, comprehensive insights.

10441,Black Friday affiliate marketing: Consumers attitudes analysis,"Black Friday has become an unparalleled opportunity for both retailers and affiliate marketers. In recent years, the shopping phenomenon has extended far beyond just one day, often spanning an entire week or more. 

This high-energy shopping event provides affiliates with a golden opportunity to connect with consumers eager for deals, creating a unique environment where affiliates can drive significant conversions and commissions. 

In this guide, you'll learn:

 	How to uncover customer motivations and attitudes driving Black Friday;
 	How to leverage tracking for data-driven decisions;
 	Strategies for optimizing affiliate campaigns for maximum ROI;
 	Proven methods for building trust and credibility with potential customers;
 	How to measure and optimize Black Friday campaign performance in real-time.

Read on to learn how affiliates can capitalize on this major shopping event.
Black Friday’s potential for affiliates
As consumer demand surges, shoppers' focus is sharply directed at finding the best possible deals. This is a day when shoppers actively seek guidance on the best purchases, presenting affiliates with a captive audience. Affiliates serve as invaluable resources, guiding shoppers toward deals that resonate with their interests, budgets, and needs.

To successfully connect with consumers on Black Friday, affiliates must recognize the specific factors driving buying decisions. Consumers are not merely looking for any deal; they’re hunting for significant discounts, exclusive offers, and products that align with their personal preferences. 
Inside the mind of the Black Friday shopper
The digital transformation of shopping is undeniable, with the majority of Black Friday purchases now taking place online. Mobile devices and desktops have become the primary tools for shoppers, as they appreciate the convenience of browsing deals without facing in-store crowds. This shift requires affiliates to optimize their campaigns for mobile accessibility and seamless online navigation.

Black Friday shoppers are generally motivated by a few key factors. Insights from industry expert Mark Stiving highlight that deep discounts are a major draw – often, the steeper the discount, the better. Shoppers also crave exclusivity, seeking ""early bird"" or VIP deals that make them feel valued.

Additionally, many view Black Friday as the start of their holiday shopping, making it an ideal moment for affiliates to promote popular gift items and seasonal products.

This Black Friday, affiliates in specific verticals can capitalize on high consumer demand. Key categories to focus on include:

 	Financial services, insurance, and related offerings: Tend to see increased interest during Black Friday. Consumers seek deals on financial products, insurance policies, and investment opportunities. For instance, credit card companies may offer sign-up bonuses, while insurance providers may discount premiums. Affiliates promoting financial planning and advisory services can also expect strong engagement.
 	The nutraceutical and health supplements industry: Thrives during Black Friday as consumers prioritize wellness and self-care. With wellness on everyone's mind, affiliates promoting vitamins, minerals, protein powders, fitness supplements, weight loss products, and skincare can expect strong engagement.
 	E-commerce and cash-on-delivery: Sales surge during Black Friday, especially in categories like electronics, fashion, home goods, and beauty products. Affiliates can promote doorbuster deals, discounts, and bundle offers on popular products.
 	The gaming and software industry: This coincides with the peak holiday season, driven by new game releases, console discounts, and software promotions. Affiliates can tap into this frenzy by promoting gaming consoles, accessories, and online gaming subscriptions.

RedTrack’s tracking offers affiliates an edge by providing access to consumer trend data during the busiest shopping hours. By monitoring which products and categories are most popular, affiliates can adjust their campaigns instantly to align with trending items, maximizing relevance and appeal.
How shoppers perceive affiliate links
Today’s consumers are more comfortable than ever with affiliate links, particularly when these links provide relevant and valuable recommendations. If an affiliate link directs them toward a genuine deal or a product that matches their needs, shoppers are likely to engage positively.

Trust also plays a critical role in affiliate marketing. Shoppers are drawn to authentic recommendations and honest reviews from affiliates. Transparency about affiliations and straightforward product recommendations help to build this trust.

In the same vein, clear and honest communication can make all the difference. Consumers respond well to upfront, transparent links that feel organic and helpful rather than forced. Affiliates who disclose their partnerships and provide genuine value are more likely to win consumers’ trust and encourage conversions.

Using RedTrack, affiliates can track how shoppers respond to affiliate links in real-time. This insight allows them to refine and adjust links to ensure they resonate with buyers, ultimately enhancing both the relevance and effectiveness of their campaigns.
The factors driving conversions on Black Friday
Optimize your affiliate marketing strategy with these essential factors that influence consumer purchasing decisions on the biggest shopping day of the year:
The best deals matter
Consumers are heavily influenced by the quality of discounts. Significant, no-strings-attached savings are a powerful motivator. Affiliates who promote offers with clear, compelling discounts are more likely to see conversions.
Product quality and social proof
Consumers look for reassurance in the form of product reviews and social proof. Positive reviews and endorsements can make a crucial difference in helping shoppers feel confident about their purchase decisions.
Perfect timing
Timing is everything on Black Friday. Affiliates who time their promotions to peak shopping hours have a better chance of catching shoppers when they’re ready to buy. Staying aligned with high-traffic periods allows affiliates to maximize visibility and conversions.
Seamless experience
A frictionless shopping experience can make or break conversions. Affiliates should aim for a smooth link-to-checkout flow without too many steps, ensuring that consumers don’t abandon the process midway.
Effective Black Friday affiliate marketing tactics
To stand out in the crowded Black Friday marketplace, affiliates need strategic approaches that drive results. Consider leveraging these effective tactics to boost conversions, build trust, and outperform the competition:
Personalization
Customizing offers to specific audiences is a proven strategy in affiliate marketing. By tailoring offers based on demographic data, browsing history, and previous purchases, affiliates can create campaigns that feel more personalized and compelling.
Implementation tips:

 	Use dynamic content: Incorporate dynamic content in emails, websites, and social ads to reflect users’ interests. For example, use retargeting pixels to display previously viewed products with updated discounts. This can boost CTRs significantly, often by 20%+.
 	Leverage first-party data: Gather data on users' past purchases, page views, and demographic segments. For example, if your data shows a high purchase likelihood for certain products among 25–34-year-olds, create targeted ads specifically for this age range.
 	Segmentation metrics: Track segmented user behavior and engagement metrics (CTR) for different audience groups. This helps you understand which segments respond best to which types of personalization.

Key metrics to track:

 	Conversion rate per segment: Evaluate which segments convert higher with specific offers.
 	Customer lifetime value: Measure if personalized campaigns increase CLTV by encouraging repeat purchases.
 	Return on ad spend: ROAS can indicate if certain personalized campaigns yield more profit relative to ad costs.

Transparency in messaging
Consumers are put off by hidden conditions or confusing terms. Transparent messaging—directly outlining deal details and requirements—is essential. Shoppers appreciate clarity, and affiliates who offer straightforward information tend to build stronger rapport and trust.
Implementation tips:

 	Clear call-to-actions: Ensure your CTAs explicitly communicate what customers can expect, e.g., “Get 30% off with free shipping—no minimum purchase.” Use tools like heatmaps; Hotjar or Crazy Egg to see where users click and gauge whether messaging is resonating.
 	Test different formats: A/B test straightforward, bullet-point summaries of offers versus more detailed descriptions. Use tools like Google Optimize for split testing and tracking performance.
 	Be upfront about conditions: List the terms clearly in pop-ups or banners, especially if the discount applies only to certain items or requires a minimum purchase.

Key metrics to track:

 	Click-through rate: Higher CTRs on transparent, clearly labeled ads and CTAs typically indicate trust.
 	Bounce rate: A high bounce rate may suggest confusion or mistrust; tweak messaging for clarity.
 	Engagement rate: Monitor session duration and scroll depth to determine if users are engaging with the entire message.

Timing campaigns
Effective timing involves launching campaigns that align with shopping patterns. For example, affiliates might choose to start early Black Friday promotions to capture shoppers looking for early deals and continue through Cyber Monday.
Implementation tips:

 	Early bird offers and countdown timers: Use countdown timers and pop-up notifications to build urgency for limited-time offers, capitalizing on the anticipation around Black Friday.
 	Automated drip campaigns: Schedule email campaigns that build interest gradually (e.g., “3 days to go,” “Early access for loyal customers”). Tools like Klaviyo or Mailchimp allow for automation, and affiliates can monitor open rates to determine the most effective send times.
 	Testing campaign duration: Test the duration of Black Friday deals—some shoppers will buy immediately, while others wait for the best offer. Run a short (e.g., 48-hour) early-access test to see if conversions are concentrated at certain times.

Key metrics to track:

 	Open rates and CTR for emails: Measure the engagement of pre-launch and reminder emails to gauge optimal timing.
 	Conversion rate by hour: Track conversions across the day, especially during key dates (e.g., Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Cyber Monday) to identify peak hours.
 	Average order value: Evaluate if conversions increase with prolonged campaigns or short, high-urgency windows.

Cross-channel approach
A multi-channel strategy is invaluable. Affiliates who reach consumers on social media, email, and mobile can stay top-of-mind throughout the holiday shopping period, increasing the chances of conversion.
Implementation tips:

 	Consistency across channels: Use consistent messaging and branding across social media, email, and mobile push notifications to reinforce the offer across touchpoints.
 	Utilize pixel data for retargeting: Place tracking pixels from Facebook, Google, or other ad platforms on landing pages. This enables retargeting campaigns on social media and display ads, which can yield up to a 10x increase in ad engagement.
 	Create dedicated landing pages for each channel: Tailor landing pages for each traffic source (email, social, SMS) to match messaging and increase conversion likelihood. Track these using UTM parameters for granular data.

Key metrics to track:

 	Channel-specific ROAS: Measure the ROAS per channel to identify which channels are most profitable.
 	Attribution analysis: Use tools like Google Analytics to determine which channel initiates, assists, and completes most conversions.
 	Multi-channel conversion rate: Track how many users convert after interacting with more than one channel, which often indicates the impact of consistent, cross-channel messaging.

10467,RSOC traffic arbitrage best practices: Maximizing revenue and user experience,"RSOC, or Reverse Search Organic Clicks, is a digital marketing strategy that combines paid traffic with organic search principles. It's a powerful way to drive conversions and revenue by aligning your content with user intent. In leveraging low-cost traffic and guiding users to relevant, monetized content, RSOC campaigns can achieve impressive returns on investment, making it an interesting option for search arbitrage and search engine arbitrage. By utilizing related search terms, marketers can further enhance their campaigns.

In this guide, we'll break down the ins and outs of RSOC, including its benefits, best practices, and challenges, to help you get started with this profitable marketing strategy.

Let's get started!
What is RSOC?
At its core, RSOC seeks to capitalize on user behavior in search engines by guiding them from paid clicks to highly relevant organic results or monetized web pages.

Unlike traditional SEO, which focuses on ranking organically for high-value keywords, RSOC leverages paid traffic sources to intercept users searching for specific terms. These users are then directed to tailored content or search result pages designed to encourage further engagement. The result is a seamless blend of paid and organic strategies, where marketers profit from the differential between the cost of acquiring traffic and the revenue generated from that traffic.

RSOC is particularly popular in arbitrage, where the ability to generate a positive return on investment is key. By targeting niche markets, optimizing traffic sources, and carefully designing content, RSOC practitioners can achieve scalable results with relatively low competition.
How does RSOC Arbitrage work?
RSOC arbitrage, also known as search arbitrage operates on a fundamental economic principle: buy low, sell high. In this case, the “buy low” aspect involves acquiring traffic at minimal cost, and the “sell high” component revolves around monetizing that traffic through affiliate programs, lead generation, or other revenue streams. The step-by-step process includes:

&nbsp;
Traffic acquisition
Marketers purchase traffic from various platforms, including native ad networks, PPC campaigns, and display ads. These platforms typically offer cost-efficient options for driving large volumes of visitors. This process is a crucial component of search arbitrage, where marketers carefully select the best traffic sources for their campaigns. 
Search query alignment
The acquired traffic is redirected to search feed pages or content that matches the user's original intent. For example, a user searching for “best budget smartphones” might be shown a page listing organic search results or affiliate product recommendations.
Monetization
Revenue is generated when users interact with the monetized elements on the page. This could include clicking on ads, purchasing products, or signing up for services.
Optimization and scaling
Continuous analysis of key metrics such as click-through rates, cost per click, and conversion rates enables marketers to refine their strategies. Successful campaigns are scaled by increasing ad spend or targeting broader audiences.

&nbsp;

RSOC arbitrage requires careful planning and constant monitoring to remain profitable. Misaligned user intent, high bounce rates, or low conversion rates can quickly erode margins, making optimization a critical aspect of the process.
Types of RSOC click and conversion funnels
Effective conversion funnels are the backbone of RSOC campaigns, guiding users from the initial click to the desired action. Here are some common types of RSOC funnels:

&nbsp;

 	Direct monetization funnels: In these funnels, traffic is driven directly to monetized offers such as product pages, affiliate links, or pay-per-click advertisements. These are straightforward and focus on immediate ROI.
 	Lead generation funnels: Users are funneled through pages that encourage them to provide their contact details, such as email addresses or phone numbers. These leads can then be sold to businesses or used in email marketing campaigns.
 	Content engagement funnels: Here, users are directed to high-quality content pages that contain embedded monetization elements. Examples include blogs with ad placements, listicles with affiliate links, or reviews with product recommendations.
 	Hybrid funnels: Combining elements of multiple funnel types, hybrid funnels cater to diverse user intents. For instance, a page might include both valuable content and a clear call-to-action for a product purchase.

&nbsp;

The success of any funnel depends on understanding user intent and aligning it with the content and monetization strategy, which is crucial for traffic arbitrage.
How to monetize RSOC
Monetizing RSOC traffic is where the strategy truly pays off. With a wide range of revenue streams available, marketers can choose the methods that best align with their goals and audience. 

In this section, we'll explore the most effective ways to monetize website traffic, including the benefits and best practices for each approach: 
Affiliate marketing
Affiliate marketing is one of the most common ways to achieve traffic monetization. Marketers earn commissions by driving traffic to partner websites, where users complete purchases or other predefined actions. Popular affiliate programs include Amazon Associates, CJ Affiliate, and ClickBank.
Ad revenue
Content-heavy RSOC campaigns often monetize through ad impressions or clicks. Platforms like Google AdSense or Media.net allow marketers to display ads relevant to their audience, earning revenue each time users interact with these ads.
Lead generation
Lead generation involves collecting user information, such as names, emails, or phone numbers, and selling these leads to businesses. Industries like finance, insurance, and education often pay a premium for high-quality leads.
E-commerce and product sales
Marketers can use RSOC traffic to boost the visibility and sales of their products or services. For example, directing traffic to an e-commerce store selling niche products can yield significant returns.
Subscription services
Recurring revenue models, such as subscription-based software or content platforms, can also benefit from RSOC campaigns. By driving targeted traffic to subscription offers, marketers can create long-term income streams.
Important RSOC metrics
Tracking and optimizing key metrics is crucial for the success of any RSOC campaign. But with so many metrics to choose from, it can be overwhelming to know where to start.To run a successful RSOC campaign, tracking and optimizing key metrics is essential. Here are some of the most critical metrics:

 	Cost per click: CPC determines the expense of acquiring each click. A low CPC is crucial for maintaining profitability.
 	Click-through rate: CTR measures how many users click on an ad relative to the total number of impressions. High CTRs indicate that your ad creatives are resonating with the audience.
 	Conversion rate: This metric tracks the percentage of users who complete a desired action, such as making a purchase or signing up for a service.
 	Revenue per click: RPC shows how much revenue is generated per click. Comparing RPC with CPC helps determine whether a campaign is profitable.
 	Bounce rate: A high bounce rate may signal poor user alignment with your landing page. Conversely, a low bounce rate indicates that users find your content engaging.
 	Return on ad spend: ROAS measures the total revenue generated for every dollar spent on advertising, offering a clear picture of overall campaign profitability.

Best RSOC search feed providers
Selecting the right search feed provider is critical in building a successful RSOC campaign. With so many options available, it can be challenging to determine which providers offer the best combination of targeting capabilities, traffic volume, and cost-effectiveness. 

Choosing the right search feed provider can make or break an RSOC campaign. Here are some of the best options:
Google AdSense for search
This platform provides access to Google’s vast search network, enabling marketers to deliver highly targeted results to users.
Yahoo! search ads
Yahoo! offers competitive CPC rates and access to diverse audiences, making it a valuable tool for RSOC marketers.
Bing ads
Bing’s lower competition and strong performance in specific niches make it a viable alternative to Google.
Media.net
Powered by Yahoo! and Bing, Media.net specializes in contextual advertising, aligning perfectly with RSOC’s focus on user intent.
Taboola and outbrain
These native ad networks are excellent for acquiring traffic and funneling it into RSOC

campaigns.
What are the benefits of RSOC?
RSOC offers a unique set of advantages that make it an attractive strategy for digital marketers. But what exactly makes RSOC so beneficial for marketers? RSOC offers numerous advantages to digital marketers, including:

 	Less funnel click: Unlike traditional search feed placements, because RSOC is integrated into the content or landing page, the user only needs to click once before landing on the search results page. This allows for fewer steps and clicks prior to conversion and less conversion friction.
 	Incremental revenue: RSOC is designed to maximize content and search monetization. RSOC can potentially yield higher revenue and earnings per click based on the native look and feel and content-to-ad relevancy promoting a higher desire to explore relevant content and engage with search ads. More money can be earned by driving more traffic to the search pages.
 	Increased site engagement: RSOC can help increase site engagement including site traffic, page views, and ad impressions. Visitor Average Time on Page and Bounce Rate will both be positive because the user not only engages with the desired content but also with relevant content and ads that match their original intent
 	Relevant search ads: Sponsored search ads become highly relevant and increasingly accurate to provide the intended or desired outcome in a high-quality manner for the user
 	Better user search experience: RSOC can be customized to natively integrate with the existing look and feel of a search page minimizing content viewing disruption and promoting a high-quality user experience.

That's where RedTrack comes in — an effective tracking and analytics platform designed to simplify RSOC campaign management. With RedTrack, you can effectively integrate your traffic sources, define clear conversion goals, and gain actionable insights into your campaign's performance. 

RedTrack simplifies RSOC campaign management with robust tracking and analytics tools. Here’s how to use it effectively:

 	Set up tracking parameters: Integrate your traffic sources and define tracking parameters like UTM tags to monitor performance.
 	Define goals: Identify clear conversion objectives, such as clicks, sales, or form submissions.
 	Analyze data: Use RedTrack’s dashboard to evaluate key metrics, such as CTR and conversion rates.
 	Optimize campaigns: Refine your strategies based on RedTrack’s insights, focusing on high-performing sources and keywords.
 	Generate reports: Automated reporting simplifies data sharing and helps track long-term trends.

Challenges with tracking RSOC campaigns
While RSOC offers lucrative opportunities, it also comes with challenges:

 	Attribution issues: Multi-touch funnels can make it difficult to determine which source drove a conversion.
 	Data discrepancies: Inconsistent tracking data can hinder decision-making.
 	Ad fraud: Invalid clicks and bot traffic can inflate costs without contributing to ROI.
 	Scaling difficulties: Expanding campaigns while maintaining profitability requires careful planning and execution.
 	Platform restrictions: Search feed providers often impose strict rules on traffic sources, limiting flexibility.

How to build content pages
Content pages bridge the gap between paid traffic and monetization. Here’s how to build them effectively:

 	Understand user intent: Create content that aligns with what your audience is searching for.
 	Optimize for engagement: Use compelling headlines, visuals, and CTAs to keep users on the page.
 	Optimize for engagement: Use compelling headlines, visuals, and CTAs to keep users on the page. For example, an article on “best laptops for students” could feature attention-grabbing subheadings, product comparison tables, and clear purchase links.
 	SEO optimization: Although RSOC relies on paid traffic, optimizing content for search engines can provide additional organic traffic. Include relevant keywords, meta descriptions, and alt text for images to enhance page visibility.
 	Embed monetization opportunities: Strategically place affiliate links, advertisements, or lead generation forms within the content. For instance, a product review page can include affiliate buttons under each recommendation, driving users to purchase.
 	A/B test page elements: Experiment with different layouts, CTAs, and content styles to determine what resonates most with your audience. Continuous testing helps refine pages for maximum conversion.
 	Maintain high-quality content: Trustworthy and informative content fosters credibility, making users more likely to engage with your offers. Avoid clickbait and ensure that the content delivers value aligned with the user's intent.

Example: Building a product review page
Suppose you're running an RSOC campaign targeting the keyword ""best gaming headphones under $100."" A well-designed page could feature:

 	Introduction: A brief overview of gaming headphones and why they're essential.
 	Product comparisons: Highlight the top five products with features, pros, and cons.
 	Affiliate links: Direct links to purchase options like Amazon or Best Buy.
 	Engaging CTAs: Phrases like “Check Latest Price” or “Buy Now” placed strategically.

Such a page not only addresses user intent but also maximizes monetization opportunities.
Conclusion
RSOC is a powerful strategy for digital marketers looking to combine paid traffic with organic search principles. Its foundation lies in leveraging low-cost traffic to guide users to monetized content or organic results that meet their intent. However, RSOC isn’t without challenges. Issues like attribution complexities, data discrepancies, and ad fraud require careful management. Tools like RedTrack simplifies tracking and optimization, enabling marketers to make data-driven decisions.

Content creation plays a pivotal role in RSOC's success, bridging the gap between traffic acquisition and monetization. High-quality, user-focused content that aligns with search intent not only enhances engagement but also drives conversions.

While mastering its intricacies takes time, the rewards can be substantial for those willing to invest in continuous learning and optimization. With the right approach, RSOC can be a cornerstone of a highly profitable digital marketing strategy.",12/6/2024,https://redtrack.io/blog/rsoc-traffic-arbitrage-best-practices-maximizing-revenue-and-user-experience/,ad tracking
10483,E-commerce analytics: Leveraging data for increased conversions and revenue,"What is E-Commerce Analytics? 

E-commerce analytics means collecting and studying e-commerce data from online stores to help businesses make better decisions. E-commerce performance analytics includes tracking important numbers like sales, customer actions, and how well the website works. Businesses can learn useful information that helps them improve their marketing efforts, make shopping better for customers, and increase their profits by using e-commerce analytics tools. When businesses understand how customers use their online store, they can adjust what they offer and improve their overall success in a competitive market.

Why is E-Commerce Analytics So Important? 

Analytics in e-commerce is very important for the success of online businesses. It helps companies collect and study large amounts of data from customer interactions. This data gives valuable information about what customers like and how they behave, allowing businesses to make smart choices. For example, by looking at buying patterns, companies can see which products are popular and change their stock to meet demand.

E-commerce analytics also helps businesses check how well their marketing campaigns are working. Knowing which strategies get the best results can help companies use their resources better, leading to more profits. Using these insights is key to staying competitive and meeting customer needs effectively.

What Metrics are Shown by E-Commerce Analytics Software?

E-commerce analytics software provides a wide range of metrics that help businesses evaluate their performance. Understanding these metrics is important for making data-driven decisions that drive growth.

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is a key metric that shows how much money a business can expect to make from one customer during their time with the company. Understanding CLV helps businesses focus on keeping their current customers happy instead of just trying to get new ones. For example, if a regular customer buys from the store many times, knowing their CLV allows businesses to create special marketing plans that help them earn more from that customer. This information encourages companies to invest in loyalty programs or personalized marketing that makes the shopping experience better for customers.

Customer Retention Rate (CRR)

Customer Retention Rate (CRR) measures the percentage of customers who keep buying from a business over a certain time. A high CRR shows that customers are loyal and happy with the brand. Businesses can find out what keeps customers coming back and develop plans to strengthen their loyalty by looking closely at CRR. For example, if the data shows that customers who interact with specific content are more likely to return, companies can create special campaigns that encourage these interactions. In the end, improving CRR helps businesses boost sales while keeping customer acquisition costs low.

Shopping Cart Abandonment Rate

The Shopping Cart Abandonment Rate shows the percentage of customers who add items to their cart but do not finish the purchase. When this rate is high, it can mean there are problems with the checkout process or the prices of the items. Businesses can find out what stops customers from completing their purchases by looking closely at this metric. For example, if many customers leave their carts at a certain point in the checkout process, it might mean they are confused or frustrated with that step. Fixing these issues can greatly lower abandonment rates and help more customers complete their purchases.

Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) measures how much money a business spends to gain a new customer. This cost includes expenses for marketing campaigns, sales efforts, and any other resources used to attract customers. Knowing the CAC helps businesses see how well their marketing strategies are working and make sure they are spending their money wisely. If the CAC is too high compared to Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), it could mean that the marketing efforts need to be looked at again or improved. By reducing CAC through targeted advertising or using more effective marketing channels, businesses can increase their profits.

Bounce Rate

Bounce Rate measures the percentage of visitors who leave a website after looking at just one page. A high bounce rate means that many visitors are not finding what they want or that the website is not interesting enough to keep them around. Businesses can find parts of their website that need improvement by looking closely at bounce rates. For example, if certain pages have high bounce rates, it might be a good idea to improve those pages with better images or more useful information. This can help keep visitors interested and encourage them to explore more of the site.

How to Leverage Data to Drive Sales with E-Commerce Analytics

Here are some easy ways businesses can use this data to their advantage:

Personalization

Use customer data to create shopping experiences that feel personal and special. Businesses can suggest products they might like by looking at what customers have bought before and what they browse. For example, if someone often buys sports gear, the website can show them workout clothes or accessories. This personal touch makes customers feel appreciated and encourages them to shop again.

Targeted Marketing

Look at customer demographics and behaviors to create marketing campaigns that reach the right people. This way, businesses can send messages matching what different customer groups want. For example, a store might send special deals on toys to parents or discounts on travel bags to people who travel often. Businesses can get more attention and increase sales by focusing on specific groups.

Optimize User Experience

Regularly check how users behave on the website to find problems in their shopping experience. This includes seeing where customers leave the site or which pages they do not stay on long. Making changes based on this information can help keep customers happy and increase sales. For instance, making the checkout process easier or improving website navigation can help customers finish their purchases without frustration.

Analytics vs. Metrics vs. KPIs

Understanding the differences between analytics, metrics, and KPIs is essential for effective e-commerce performance evaluation.



Key Metrics for Enterprise Business Success

For enterprise-level e-commerce businesses, tracking key metrics is essential for sustained success:

Pages per Visit

Pages per Visit measures how many pages a user looks at during one session on an e-commerce site. A higher number means users are more engaged and interested in the products offered. This metric helps businesses find which products are popular and allows them to improve their website design to make the shopping experience better for visitors.

Returning Visitors

Returning Visitors tracks the percentage of users who come back to the site after their first visit. A high rate shows customers are loyal to the brand and happy with their previous experiences. Understanding this metric can help businesses improve their marketing strategies and build strong, long-lasting relationships with their customers.

Time on Site

Time on Site measures how long visitors spend on an e-commerce site during each visit. Longer times usually mean that users find the content interesting or useful. Looking at this metric helps businesses see how well their content is working and make changes to keep users engaged and wanting to explore more.

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) estimates how much money a business can expect to make from a single customer over the entire time they do business together. Knowing CLV helps businesses focus on keeping customers and making the most profit over time. This information allows companies to create marketing efforts that support and strengthen important customer relationships.

Page Load Time

Page Load Time tells us how quickly a web page opens for users. Faster load times create a better user experience and lower bounce rates, which means more people stay on the site and make purchases. Keeping an eye on this metric helps businesses find technical problems and improve their website's performance.

Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

Understanding Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) is important for checking how well marketing efforts are working and making sure the business can grow steadily. CAC measures all the costs involved in getting a new customer, including advertising expenses. Looking at CAC along with CLV can surely help businesses improve their marketing strategies to get better returns on their investments.

10494,Snapchat for affiliate marketers: Engaging gen z and millennials,"Snapchat is a platform often overlooked for affiliate marketing. And that’s exactly why you should explore Snapchat affiliate marketing in 2025. What makes Snapchat unique is its user demographic - overwhelming Gen Z and Millennials. The platform has 443 million daily active users, with most opening the app at least 30 times a day. 

Think of the marketing potential. 

At RedTrack, we maximize your affiliate marketing on Snapchat. You can measure and manage all your campaigns with just one ad tracking and automation tool. Streamline your workflow and centralize your tracking with top-tier CAPI and hyper-accurate tracking by starting your free RedTrack trial today.

We’re deep-diving into everything you need to know about Snapchat affiliate marketing, from which affiliate marketing verticals work best to how to maximize your conversion rates. 
What is Snapchat?
Snapchat is a multi-media platform focused on images, videos, and messages designed to disappear within one view or 24 hours. Photos and videos are commonly referred to as “snaps” with users able to post photos and videos to their profile as stories – similar to Instagram – to view for 24 hours. 

Snapchat is the social media platform that belongs to Gen Z and Millennials. Over 90% of Gen Z users in 25+ countries use Snapchat, along with 73% of 13-34 year olds in the same countries. The platform estimates that the so-called ‘Snapchat Generation’ has $4.4 trillion in global spending power.

What makes Snapchat stand out, compared to platforms like TikTok and Facebook, is its popularity within certain regions. India is the country with the largest Snapchat audience, clocking in at over 202 million, followed by the United States at over 106 million. Pakistan, France, and the United Kingdom each have over 20 million Snapchat users. 

If you’re targeting consumers in these countries, you can’t afford to overlook the potential of Snapchat affiliate marketing. 
Understanding Snapchat Users' Nature
The short lifespan of Snapchat’s messages and stories encourages users to return to the platform more often. 443 million daily active users open their Snapchat app at least 30 times a day, prompted by messages and the lack of a traditional feed like X or Facebook. 

&nbsp;

Just like on Instagram, Snapchat users follow friends, family members, influencers, and businesses. What makes a Snapchat affiliate program attractive is the parasocial relationships users develop on the platform, giving them more influence over purchasing decisions than celebrities and influencers on other social media platforms. 

&nbsp;

The lack of a traditional feed on Snapchat is one of the reasons why the platform’s users are considered to be happier and more receptive to ads. Snapchat claims its users are genuinely happier because “they feel free to express their authentic selves”. 
Which Verticals to Consider?
If you’re considering the potential of snap on affiliate marketing, you’ll want to think about verticals. The affiliate marketing verticals that are best suited for Snapchat reflect its Gen Z and Millennial user base. 

Dating, eCommerce, fitness, and nutrition are verticals that can easily earn money from Snapchat. The platform is acutely aware of this, implementing updates like the “try on’ feature to elevate the advertising experience for its users. 

Any vertical with a Gen Z or Millennial target audience can leverage the potential of Snapchat affiliate marketing. 
The Best Advertising Practices for Snapchat
Advertising on Snapchat requires a different approach to Facebook Ads. The key is to build an authentic relationship with your audience by creating high-quality content that feels personal. Your affiliate marketing on Snapchat should feel like recommendations, rather than in-your-face marketing. 
Instant and Advanced Create
You don’t have to spend hours working on your Snapchat campaigns. Instant Create allows you to create a campaign with a single ad in just 5 minutes. This streamlined ad creation flow utilizes tested templates with simplified ad options. You can go one step further with Advanced Create by using advanced targeting to select additional parameters like interests, devices, and custom audiences. 
Video or Single Image Ads
Don’t overthink your Snapchat ads. Start with a video or single image to reach new customers and grow your following. These types of Snapchat ads are given Spotlight and Stories ad placements, helping to boost your ROI and conversion rate. 

Snapchat recommends that video ads should be between 3 and 5 seconds with the ‘offer’ to your audience appearing in the first seconds. Keep your content relevant and experiment with different media types, including video and single images, to optimize your ads. 
Snapchat Masks and Drawings to Blend In
The focus of your Snapchat affiliate marketing strategy should be to blend in. Your audience should feel like they’re getting a recommendation from a friend, rather than a business or influencer. Use special effects and popular filters to blend in, incorporating organic and everyday content alongside your ads and affiliate marketing. 

Using AR content, masks, and drawings can also help drive engagement to your Snapchat posts for higher conversions.  
What Is Snapchat Affiliate Marketing?


Affiliate marketing is when a user or business promotes products or services and receives a commission for each sale made through their links. It’s one of the best ways to earn money from Snapchat as the platform makes it easy to post affiliate links within content. 

Best of all – there’s no follower requirement. You don’t need 10,000 Snapchat followers to get started. The platform’s younger demographic and high engagement rate make it ideal for affiliate marketing. As a mobile-first platform, it’s ideal for incorporating product links and discount codes.
How to Use Snapchat for Affiliate Marketing
Whether you’re a business or an influencer, you might be wondering “can we make money from Snapchat?”. The answer: absolutely!

While you can use Snapchat ads, there are three ways to post affiliate links on Snapchat organically:

 	In direct messaging chats
 	In Snapchat stories
 	In snaps sent to followers

You can choose photos or videos for any of this content and use the paperclip icon to add your affiliate marketing link. Companies with a primarily Gen Z and Millennial customer base can enhance their Snapchat affiliate program by providing users with exclusive discount codes and early access to product releases and sales. 

Why should you invest in Snapchat affiliate marketing?

The platform’s primarily younger audience is more likely to click on affiliate links and take product recommendations than on other platforms. It’s easier to nurture a relationship that feels more genuine when the content feels more exclusive and intimate than on feed-based platforms like X and Instagram. 

The short-lived nature of snaps and stories creates a sense of urgency for followers, promoting them to open the app more and engage with content on a deeper level. The focus on personal content enables businesses and influencers to create relationships with followers that feel authentic. 
Tips for Increasing Snapchat Affiliate Marketing Conversions
Whether it’s everyday lifestyle posts or behind-the-scenes content, followers feel like they can trust the users and accounts they follow on Snapchat. This relationship translates to higher conversions with the time-limited nature of snaps creating a sense of urgency amongst users to purchase a product, increasing the likelihood for an impulse purchase. 

Here are our top three tips for mastering affiliate marketing on Snapchat:
Keep Your Snaps Videos Short
Snapchat users – like on most social media platforms – have a short attention span. Keep your video content under 10 seconds or go even shorter. Snapchat recommends a duration of 5 to 7 seconds for maximum engagement. Start with a hook and highlight the product or service within the first few seconds.  
Don’t Compromise on the Video Quality
How often do you see a blurry video and just scroll on? It happens every day. Social media content is always improving in its quality. While you want to lean into a fly-on-the-wall perspective, don’t compromise on your video quality. Always record in your highest quality setting, whether it’s 1080p or 4k. 

You don’t have to splurge on an expensive camera. Your smartphone camera is all you need. Editing software like Adobe Premiere and CapCut can help add a professional touch to your snaps.
Direct Linking on the Go
The benefit of affiliate marketing on Snapchat is that it’s easy to do direct linking on the go. You can incorporate affiliate links into all your content by simply copying and pasting with the paperclip tool. 

Snapchat is for fast and quick advertising. Keep it simple, don’t overload your followers with information, and use a call to action (CTA) for your link. Using a simple CTA like “buy now” or “save 20% here” makes it easy to post on the go.

10501,Reddit advertising: Tapping into niche communities for targeted traffic,"Reddit ads are a good way to reach a lot of people and share your brand or product. In this blog, we will explain what Reddit paid ads are and talk about the good and bad sides of using them.

We will also show you how to create Reddit targeting ads so you can use your advertising budget wisely. Let’s get started!
Why Reddit Ads?
Reddit is a special website with lots of small groups called subreddits. Each group talks about one topic, like food, games, fitness, or movies. This helps businesses show their ads to the right people who already care about those things. On other social media, ads can sometimes feel annoying. But on Reddit, people often like ads if they match their interests and are done well.

Reddit is also a place where people talk honestly. This helps businesses connect with users in a real way. If you talk to people and show them you care, they’re more likely to trust you. Over time, this can help you make better relationships and loyal customers.
How Do Reddit Ads Work?
If you are wondering how do Reddit ads work, Reddit offers many ways for businesses to create and share ads. These ads can appear in different places, like the main feed where people scroll, or inside specific subredditshere they are most relevant. This flexibility helps businesses reach people where they are most engaged. 

You can use different types of ads, like image ads, video ads, or simple text posts. For example, an image ad might show a picture of your product, while a video ad could tell a story about how your product helps people. Each type of ad can be designed to grab attention in its own way.

Reddit also gives tools to track how well your Reddit paid ads are working. They measure things like cost per click (CPC) — how much you pay when someone clicks on your ad — and cost per view (CPV) — how much you pay when someone watches your video ad. These tools let you see if your ad is getting good results. If not, you can adjust it to make it better.
How to Target Reddit Ads?
To make your Reddit paid ads reach the right people, you need to set up a group in your ad campaign. You can choose between these two:


 	 Interest groups let you pick general categories that match your audience’s likes, such as technology, sports, or travel.


 	 Subreddit groups allow you to focus on specific subreddits that are directly related to your business.

You can also narrow down your audience by choosing details like location, language, or device type (like mobile or desktop). Adding keywords helps you make sure your ads are even more focused. Finally, you set a budget to control how much you spend, so you never go over what you can afford. Looking for Reddit ad examples from successful Reddit ad campaigns can also inspire new ideas for businesses looking to enhance their marketing efforts.
How to Create and Optimize Reddit Ads?
Creating Reddit advertisers is simple if you know the basics. First, choose the type of ad you want to run. There are two main options: Link Ads and Text Ads. Link Ads take users to an external website, like your store or blog, while Text Ads let you write longer messages that appear as posts on Reddit. Text Ads are great for sharing detailed information or starting discussions. To make your ads more eye-catching, consider adding images or videos. A striking picture or short, engaging video can quickly grab attention and encourage interaction.

When making your ad, focus on three main parts: a catchy headline to draw people in, a clear call to action (CTA) like “Shop Now” or “Learn More,” and a short, interesting description of your offer. You can make your ad more engaging by using tools like emojis, bold text, or creative formatting. Once your ad is ready, take the time to review it and test how it looks on both mobile and desktop devices. This ensures your ad is clear, attractive, and ready to connect with your audience.
Should I Advertise on Reddit?
This is a question many businesses ask, and the answer depends on your goals. Reddit paid ads can work really well for certain businesses, but they’re not for everyone. 

Reddit is different from other social media platforms. It doesn’t follow the same rules as Facebook or Instagram. Instead, it focuses on connecting people with similar interests in smaller communities. This makes Reddit targeting ads a great choice if you want to reach a specific group of people who are already interested in your product or service.

One big advantage is that the cost of Reddit ads is usually cheaper compared to ads on other platforms. There’s also less competition, so your ad has a better chance of standing out. However, it’s important to approach Reddit paid ads with a plan. If you’re willing to learn how the system works and put in some effort, you can get good results.

If you decide not to invest in Reddit paid ads, you can still try organic content. This means posting helpful or interesting content in subreddits related to your business. While it takes time and effort, it can help you connect with Reddit users in a more natural way.

Remember, with Reddit (and most advertising), you get what you put in. If you take the time to understand your audience and create ads or posts they care about, you can see great results.
Potential Limitations of Reddit Ads?


Reddit paid ads can be a powerful tool for businesses, but they’re not perfect for every situation. Here are a few things to think about before you commit:
Great for Specific Targeting
Reddit advertisers work best when you focus on specific communities, or subreddits, related to your product. For example, if you sell pet products, you can target subreddits about pets or animals. However, if you’re looking for a platform that uses broad, automated targeting, Reddit might not be the best fit.
Comment Moderation Needed 
One unique thing about Reddit targeting ads is that users can comment on them. This can be a good thing because it opens up conversations and helps you build trust with your audience. However, you’ll need to watch and moderate the comments. If someone posts negative feedback or spam, you’ll have to respond or remove it. If you don’t have the time to moderate, you can turn off comments, but this might limit engagement.
Time and Effort Required
Reddit users are smart and often value honest, high-quality content. If your ad doesn’t feel genuine or doesn’t match the tone of the subreddit, it might not do well. To succeed, you’ll need to spend time understanding your audience and creating ads that feel natural and relevant.

Reddit targeting ads are a great option for businesses that want to connect with niche groups of people. But if you’re looking for a simple, hands-off advertising solution, other platforms might be a better fit. Always take the time to think about your goals and whether Reddit’s unique style matches what you’re trying to achieve.
How to Implement Reddit Marketing 
If you want to use Reddit to promote your brand, follow these simple steps. Whether you’re a small business owner or an experienced marketer, these tips will help you stand out and connect with the right audience.
Setting Up Your Reddit Profile
Start by creating a strong profile. Here’s how:

 	 Choose a name that’s short, easy to remember, and related to your brand. Avoid using numbers or symbols.


 	 Keep it short but highlight what your brand does and why it’s special. This helps Reddit users understand you quickly.


 	 If you’re representing a brand, use your logo or a high-quality image that represents your business.


 	 Make it easy for people to visit your site by including the link in your profile.

Developing a Content Strategy
Once your profile is ready, the next step is to plan what you’ll post on Reddit. A good Reddit marketing strategy will help you reach more people and keep them interested in your brand. Here’s how to do it:

 	Use Reddit’s search to discover communities related to your brand. Check out what people talk about and what kind of posts do well.
 	Plan your posts in advance to stay consistent.
 	Share text, images, videos, and links to keep your audience interested.
 	If you’re stuck, use AI tools to brainstorm new content ideas.
 	Share your posts when your target subreddits are most active to get more views and engagement.

A well-planned content strategy makes it easier to connect with the right audience and grow your presence on Reddit.
Engaging with the Community
Success on Reddit isn’t just about posting content — it’s also about being part of the community. Engaging with users builds trust and creates meaningful connections.

 	 When people comment on your posts, take the time to respond thoughtfully. This shows you value their input and are open to discussion.
 	Don’t limit yourself to your own posts. Participate in other conversations that are relevant to your brand or industry. Share your expertise, ask questions, and offer advice.
 	Consider hosting an AMA (Ask Me Anything) in a relevant subreddit. This is a great way to directly engage with users, answer their questions, and showcase your knowledge or product.
 	Look for opportunities to team up with others in your niche. This could include co-creating content, cross-promoting posts, or working together on projects.

Reddit Ads: Placement Types
When you create ads on Reddit, you have two main Reddit ad types to choose from. These are:
Feed Ads
These ads show up in the main feed while users are scrolling and browsing casually. Think of this like walking through a busy street and seeing a billboard. Feed ads are great for catching people’s attention as they browse. They’re especially useful if your goal is to increase general traffic to your website or let more people know about your brand.
Conversation Ads 
These ads appear inside specific posts or threads where people are already having detailed discussions. It’s like joining a small group chat where everyone is talking about a topic you’re related to. This type of ad works well for campaigns that target a very specific audience or want to engage deeply with users. Because these ads reach people who are already interested and involved, they can be more effective for certain goals, like driving sales or getting sign-ups.

Both Reddit ad types can be valuable, but the right choice depends on what you want to achieve. 
Conclusion 
Using a Reddit marketing strategy can help you promote your business to the right audience effectively. To maximize your advertising efforts, consider using RedTrack, an ad tracking and automation tool that provides accurate data across various platforms, including Meta, Google, and TikTok.

10511,Podcast advertising: Tapping into the audio revolution,"If you love listening to podcasts, you’ve probably heard ads for brands you didn’t know before but now recognize. Companies like Casper and Audible started as small businesses and became well-known through smart podcast advertising. These brands were just starting out when they began promoting themselves on podcasts, and they have grown a lot since then.

If you don’t have a lot of money for regular ads, podcast advertising could be a good option for you. Let’s look at why this type of advertising works well for small businesses and how to get started.
What Is Podcast Advertising?
Podcast advertising is when businesses pay to promote their products or services during a podcast episode. There are different ways to do this, such as pre-recorded ads, messages read by the podcast host, or even special episodes just for a brand.

With over 3 million podcasts available on various topics, there’s likely a podcast that fits your business. This makes podcast ads a popular choice for reaching new customers.
Why Is Podcast Advertising Effective?
Podcast ads can reach people no matter where they are — driving, exercising, studying, or cooking. Listeners have many chances throughout the day to hear these ads, which can be more effective than visual ads that need a screen.

Traditional radio ads are limited to certain times and places, while digital audio offers more flexibility. With more devices available for listening than just car radios, there are more ways to connect with audiences.

Podcast advertising allows you to target specific groups based on their activities and interests. As people get tired of looking at screens, audio advertisements can feel refreshing and leave a lasting impression on listeners.
The Benefits of Podcast Advertising


Podcast listening has grown quickly, with the number of US listeners expected to reach 114.7 million by 2025 and over 500 million worldwide. Podcasting has become very popular, giving advertisers a chance to reach audiences in all industries and sizes.

Let’s look at how effective is podcast advertising and why advertisers should keep investing:
Podcast Advertising is a Marketing Multiplier
Adding podcasts to your marketing strategy doesn’t mean you have to stop using other channels. In fact, research shows that including audio advertisements improves results across the board.

Studies found that podcasts work really well with other types of media by reaching young and engaged listeners. Most marketers believe that adding podcasts boosts campaign effectiveness by 20-40% when combined with other media.

Researchers also examined how audio ads work as part of a larger media strategy and found that adding podcasts maximizes the overall success of an advertising campaign. Their study showed that when podcasts were included with a radio campaign, the response saying “it tells me something new about the brand” increased by 30%.
Incremental Reach
Incremental reach means the new audience you can connect with through podcast ads, in addition to the people you reach with other ads like TV and radio. This is important for growing your business because if you want to increase your sales, you need to bring in new customers at the top of your marketing funnel.

Podcasting is attracting a younger crowd that is moving away from traditional media. If you want to reach this group while advertising on TV or radio, podcast ads can help you avoid overlapping audiences and make better use of your budget.
Build Brand Trust
Podcast advertising, especially when hosts read the ads, feels like a recommendation from a good friend. This happens because listeners build a special connection with podcast hosts. When people listen to their favorite shows week after week, they develop a bond similar to friendship.

A recent study showed that around 60% of podcast listeners look for their favorite podcasters and make time for their shows—more than any other type of media personality. This makes podcast listening very engaging and purposeful.
Low-Barrier to High-Profiles
Building on the previous point, audio advertisement gives you easy access to well-known names in various fields like entertainment, health, history, and culture. With podcasting, businesses can work with big names in different industries. These audio partnerships can provide similar or even higher engagement for a much lower podcast advertising cost than TV ads, allowing you to place your brand in the right niche.
Reach Audiences Away from Their Screens
Unlike many other digital ads — like TV, social media, or display ads — podcast advertising has a special advantage: it reaches people when they are not looking at screens.

Audio ads are not intrusive but still grab attention; they are subtle yet effective. This lets advertisers talk to their target audience during moments when they are not distracted by screens. The best part? The listener is already engaged because they chose to listen.
Why Advertise on Podcasts?
The IAB’s U.S. Podcast Revenue study shows that podcast advertising is expected to reach over $2 billion by 2026. Also, data from Edison Research reveals that over 40% of Americans aged 12 and older listen to podcasts at least once a month. The number of listeners has been going up since 2014, with just a small drop in 2022. With these figures, it’s clear that podcasts are becoming more popular and can greatly influence what people buy.
Who Can Benefit From Podcast Ads?
You might think that only big companies or brands that sell directly to consumers can advertise on podcasts, but that’s not true. As technology has improved, podcast ads have become available for all kinds of businesses, groups, and individuals.
Brands of All Sizes and Industries
Podcast ads and sponsorships give brands a chance to connect with an interested and engaged audience, no matter how big or small the business is. For startups, advertising on podcasts can help them stand out. It allows them to choose specific podcasts that reach niche audiences who might be interested in their products or services. For larger companies, podcasting provides a wide reach to many different audiences. Whether you want to create awareness for a new product or increase sales for a software service, there is a podcast advertising strategy that can help you achieve your goals.
Media Agencies
Media agencies gain a lot from podcast ads by helping their clients get noticed and engaged. They design special advertising plans, create interesting content, and use data to improve campaigns. Working with different podcast networks lets agencies find good spots for ads, making sure their clients reach the right audiences and see real results.
Influencers and Content Creators
Just like podcasters, podcast advertising is a great way for influencers and content creators to reach a loyal audience that shares similar interests. This approach can lead to more brand deals and sponsorships, as well as higher engagement on their other social media platforms.
Podcasters
Using podcast advertising in your marketing plan can boost your growth if you have a podcast. It’s clear that the best way to reach podcast listeners is through audio ads, making it an ideal way to introduce your show to new listeners. You can connect with your ideal audience more effectively by targeting shows with similar topics.
Types of Podcast Ads


When you plan to buy podcast ads, it’s important to choose the right ad types and where to place them. The ad formats refer to how the ads are made and how listeners experience them. Ad placements refer to when the ads are played during an episode.

Here are the types of podcast ads you should know:
Live Host-Read Ads
Live host-read ads are messages that the podcast host reads aloud in a friendly way during an episode. These ads can be placed at different times in the show, but they usually come at the start (pre-roll) or in the middle (mid-roll). These ads become a permanent part of the show’s content.
Pre-Produced Host-Read Ads
Pre-produced host-read ads are also read by the podcast host, but they are recorded ahead of time instead of being done live. These ads can be played at the beginning or middle of the episode. One advantage of these ads is that they can be added or changed easily based on what the advertisers want.
Pre-Produced Voice-Over Ads
Pre-produced voice-over ads are made in advance, similar to traditional advertising. In this case, a voice actor reads the ad instead of the podcast host. The final ad is given to the media owner for use in the podcast.
How Can Podcast Ads Be Inserted?
When it comes to placing ads in podcasts, there are two main methods: “Baked-in” Ads and Dynamic Ad Insertion.
Baked-in Ads
Baked-in ads are permanently included in the audio file. This means that every listener will hear the same ad when they tune into that episode. These ads can be inserted at any point during the podcast.
Dynamic Ad Insertion
Dynamic Ad Insertion works differently. It allows ads to be placed in specific spots that can be tailored to the listener. This approach helps advertisers reach their target audience more effectively and at the right moment. Additionally, it allows podcasters to keep their advertising current, enabling them to generate revenue from older episodes as well.
Where to Buy Podcast Advertising?
If you want to use podcast advertising, you need to know how to create a campaign. You can buy podcast advertising from us at RedTrack. Our service is easy to use, letting you create and manage your podcast ad campaigns without any hassle. You will have access to many different podcasts, so you can reach the right audience for your brand.

We provide helpful information about how your ads are doing, which helps you improve your campaigns for better results. With our tools, you can track your ads and change your plans easily. This way, you can connect with listeners and grow your business effectively.
How to Measure Podcast Advertising Effectiveness
If you’re new to podcast advertising, you might use the same metrics as paid search and social media, like CTR or CPC. However, podcasting is different because it’s audio-based and doesn’t use cookies. The audience listens instead of scrolling or clicking.

So to check your podcast advertising effectiveness, start by measuring reach, which is the number of unique listeners who heard your ad at least once. This is key for brand awareness. Look for accurate reach data, like that from RedTrack.

To track results from your ads, consider using promo codes, pixel-based tracking, vanity URLs, or surveys. A clear call to action is important to guide listeners to your website.
Conclusion
Podcast advertising is an effective way to find new customers and enhance your brand. Tapping into this popular medium can help you engage with interested listeners and create a strong impression.

10528,Affiliate marketing for SaaS products,"As competitors continue to appear, companies need an effective and efficient edge. This is where Affiliate Marketing for SaaS (software as a service) comes into play. In this blog, let us explore how affiliate marketing can be properly and effectively used to promote SaaS products.

Understanding SaaS Affiliate Marketing

In affiliate marketing for Saas, SaaS companies and Saas affiliates team up in an attempt to market and make money off of their software products. So, while a SaaS affiliate brings in clients to the business and encourages them to buy products from the company, they, in return, receive a cut or incentives from the company. 

The SaaS affiliate marketing process is simple: Once an affiliate signs up for the company's affiliate program, they receive a link or code that potential customers can use to buy the company's products. 

They will then promote the link or code on various platforms, such as blogs, websites, social media, and email marketing. Every time a customer clicks on their link, purchases the SaaS product, or registers for an account, the SaaS affiliate will receive a commission.

It offers SaaS businesses an affordable means of growing their clientele and raising brand recognition. Meanwhile, SaaS affiliates can use their current networks or audience to generate passive income by suggesting various essential SaaS tools and software to their audience. 

Promoting SaaS Products on Different Platforms



As technology continues to grow, so does the global SaaS market, with experts projecting a substantial growth from $257.47 billion to $1298.92 billion between 2023 and 2030. However, businesses want to have an edge over their competitors, so they must affiliate with SaaS on various platforms, not just social media. 

 	Blogs and Websites 

While social media often overshadows blogs and websites, plenty of people still value what they offer. Companies can create engaging and informative content, such as tutorials, reviews, and comparison articles, that will hopefully attract readers and turn them into potential customers. 

 	Social Media

Social media is one of the most popular spots for companies to promote their products, with billions of active users using it daily. Therefore, companies should use the traffic and create posts on platforms such as Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn to promote their products and engage with their audience. 

Use LinkedIn, Twitter, and Instagram platforms to engage with your audience and promote SaaS products.

 	YouTube and TikTok

Just as people like to engage in informative articles, some prefer engaging videos, and there's no better place to promote using videos than on YouTube and TikTok. Companies can create product walkthroughs and demonstrations to highlight SaaS products and their uses.

 	Email Marketing

While email marketing may seem like an outdated way of promoting, it still does the job. As such, companies should create an email list to send prospective clients information, special offers, and instructional materials.

 	Forums and Online Communities

Various forums and online communities are the perfect places to promote SaaS products indirectly so that potential audiences may be caught off guard. However, it still helps boost a product. Companies should engage in discussions on platforms like Reddit and Quora to provide value and subtly promote SaaS products.

Optimize Your SaaS Affiliate Marketing Campaigns

Knowing which platforms where companies should do their affiliate marketing for SaaS is just the first step in a successful strategy, with the true secret to SaaS affiliate marketing success being optimization.

 	Target the right audience.

Appealing to everyone is time-consuming and wastes funds that the company could have allocated to people with a higher chance of being converted into actual paying customers. As such, companies should identify their target market before anything else by identifying their problems and how the SaaS can help with their situation. Thus creating a relationship built on trust with the customer. 

 	Leverage SEO.

While creating content is one way to market a company’s SaaS products, optimizing content through SEO by using ""affiliate marketing for SaaS"" and ""best SaaS affiliate programs"" will improve search visibility and generate more traffic. 

 	 Test different strategies.

Companies each have different needs, so it often entails a different approach. After all, the best saas affiliate programs for certain companies may not be the best fit for another. As such, it's essential to test various strategies. Regularly try new campaigns, content formats, and messages to determine the most successful strategy for the company.

 	Track performance.

Tracking the campaign's performance using tools like RedTrack to identify which strategies are working and what are not quickly is essential. This allows companies to focus on a more practical approach and make better-informed decisions. 

What Makes SaaS Affiliate Programs So Profitable?

As SaaS affiliate marketing programs continue growing, more companies notice its potential. But what exactly makes these programs so profitable?


Recurring Revenue

Since essential SaaS tools and software are often subscription-based, engaging in affiliate marketing for SaaS can lead to recurring revenue. As long as customers stay subscribed to the product, a SaaS affiliate can receive a steady flow of income. 


High Demand for Digital Solutions

With the introduction of AI and continuous technological innovations, more companies are moving their operations online, creating a high demand for digital solutions. Because businesses are actively looking for your solutions, this high demand makes it easier for affiliates to promote SaaS goods.


Global Reach

Thanks to technology and the power of the internet, SaaS products can often be accessible worldwide, allowing the best SaaS affiliate programs to work from anywhere in the world, resulting in a broader range of potential customers. 

SaaS affiliate marketing also gives affiliates more chances to interact with possible customers and increase their affiliate revenue thanks to this enormous reach.


Low Overhead Costs

Compared to other business models, affiliate marketing for SaaS requires lower overhead costs since you won't have to consider customer service, shipping, and inventory costs. Companies only have to worry about finding the right SaaS affiliate marketing strategy that addresses your company’s needs. 

 

How to Succeed as an Affiliate Marketer in the SaaS World?

While the world of SaaS may be seeing an upward trend, and many companies are turning to affiliate marketing to promote their products, succeeding as an affiliate marketer is a different story. 

Step 1: Choose your niche.

Choosing a niche is one of the most critical steps to overcome to succeed as an affiliate marketer. After all, targeting everyone would be a waste of resources. As such, SaaS affiliates should focus on a specific niche market that would benefit from using the products.

Step 2: Research the right SaaS products.

Once an affiliate has found the right niche, they should choose the right Saas products to convert potential customers into loyal subscribers. As such, one should select SaaS products that provide continuous revenue opportunities and quality solutions.

Step 3: Sign up for the affiliate program.

After finding out the niche and product an affiliate wants to promote, they should sign up for the affiliate program related to the niche they're trying to appeal to. It's better to look for programs that offer timely payouts, reliable tracking systems, and unambiguous terms.

Step 4: Create engaging content.

Once everything's set and ready, it's time for the affiliate to create the content that'll help attract potential customers. Instead of simply releasing mindless content, creating valuable, engaging content that'll help introduce the product is better. That way, a SaaS company can build user relationships based on trust and reliability.

Step 5: Implement effective marketing strategies.

A single marketing strategy isn't enough for an affiliate to succeed. Instead, combine paid and organic marketing strategies — partner with influencers, use social media ads, and optimize your SEO efforts.

Step 6: Monitor and optimize your performance.

After using the correct blend of marketing strategies, it's time to monitor a campaign, identify areas that need work, and adjust them accordingly based on the data from tracking tools such as RedTrack.

Challenges in Promoting SAAS Products



Promoting SaaS products presents unique challenges that marketers must overcome, and one way to help create a successful campaign is by identifying these challenges and addressing them upfront. 

Finding people to promote your SaaS products

Finding the proper people to promote your product or service is a key factor in having a successful SaaS affiliate marketing program. However, it may not be easy to find people who will be a suitable fit. 

While there are plenty of recruitment strategies a company can use, an effortless way of finding an affiliate is by reaching out to current customers and introducing them to the SaaS affiliate marketing program.

Preventing affiliate fraud from occurring

Fraud can target anyone, and in the most recent years, it has even reached the SaaS world through bots. From Cookie stuffing, domain spoofing, and traffic rerouting to stealing content from other businesses, fraudsters can disrupt a company's marketing campaign in many ways.

Luckily, with the help of the right affiliate management platform, a company can help minimize affiliate fraud from engaging with your content even further. 

The Future of Affiliate Marketing

In recent years, affiliate marketing has become increasingly popular among marketers, opening the door for continuous growth and significant influence. With the emergence of AI, micro-influencers, and mobile-focused software, the future of affiliate marketing remains to head upward toward a more personalized and data-driven strategy. 

By being aware of these anticipated trends in affiliate marketing for SaaS, marketers, and brands can remain ahead of the curve and ensure they use today's successful campaigns. ",1/26/2025,https://redtrack.io/blog/affiliate-marketing-for-saas/,affiliate marketing
