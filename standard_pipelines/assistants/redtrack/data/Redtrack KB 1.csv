What's a Bot?



In terms of affiliate marketing, a bot is an automatic user (not a real visitor) that generates traffic. There are 2 types of bots:




good bots (like those from Google or Facebook) which simply check your campaign whether it is up to the rules or not. For good bots RedTrack has soft filters, i.e. those bots are still able to go through your campaign but you do not see them in your statistics.



bad bots which can cause a lot of problems for affiliates as this traffic never converts but spends your traffic source and tracker budget. For bad bots RedTrack introduced a bot blacklist feature.




Good bots



Not always ""Bot"" means bad clicks. There are a lot of good and friendly bots who simply check your campaigns to make sure they are safe for real visitors.&nbsp;Still, they generate automated clicks that may screw up your reports.



With RedTrack there is a good solution: you can simply filter those good bots from your reports. They will still be able to check your campaigns but you will not see those clicks in your statistics.



To enable this feature go to burger menu → Settings → General → enable the toggle Remove known (by user agent) bots/crawlers from data → Save changes:







 
Bad bots: blacklist



Bot blacklist feature works with a redirect tracking option only:



To add a bot rule to RedTrack, act as follows:



1. On the main RedTrack menu navigate to Tools→ Blacklist bots→ New:







 2. Fill in the needed fields→ Save:







Fields explained:1. Give your rule a name2. Add values to either IP addresses/IP ranges or User agent field(optional) 3. Give a small description note to your rule. This field is not mandatory.4. Press Save to apply the changes



Once enabled, traffic sent to your campaigns will be filtered based on the bot rules: bots will be excluded from the campaign report. Blocked traffic will not be counted towards your RedTrack events limit.



Ways of spotting a bot



There are 2 ways (methods) to spot a bot with RedTrack: via a Bot trap and Reports (IP or UA) :





This method does not require programming skills. You need to analyze your click logs and reports. Since in real conditions the same visitor cannot click on the same offer too many times, this method can be considered quite reliable.



This may take some time as this kind of report is taken directly from the backend and usually contains a lot of unique parameters.



1. Go to reports→ filter the data by either User agent or IP depending on the report:




If you want to analyze the data by UA (User agent) go to Campaigns→ choose the needed campaign and dive into report→ filter the data by User Agent:













If you want to analyze the data by IP go to Reports→ IP report:








2. The clicks are grouped by the set parameter. On the screen below you see that one IP has got a lot of clicks, which is pretty unusual, as, in real conditions, the live unique visitor will not click on the same campaign link that many times (it depends on your ad of course but in general they won't).&nbsp;Now you can identify bad IPs (IP ranges) and then block them:







You will need to block an IP range for the cases when the suspicious IP in your report ends with 0. That means this IP was hidden due to privacy policy. But the IP range can still be blocked. This will be something like: 69.208.0.0-69.208.0.255. The first ends with 0, the last one with 255. Take the IP from the report you want to block: 46.216.64.0. The range for this IP will be: 46.216.64.0-46.216.64.255





This method works best with landing page campaigns. In general, you will need to have access to the page code.



There are almost no traffic sources that are free of bot traffic. But it becomes a serious problem when the % of fake traffic reaches a high level, as a result, campaign optimization is very complicated. Bot trap is not a 100% reliable method of detection, some advanced bots can pass, but the majority have a very primitive structure.



Since RedTrack allows you to track multi-offer landing pages, you can add an offer for bots in your campaign, so the bot traffic can be filtered after.



To implement this method act as follows:



1. Create 2 offers: a blank offer for bots and your real offer for your product (or several offers).2. Create a Campaign.3. Put an “invisible” clickable link on your landing page.



The link:▸should contain https://your.domain.com/click/1 – it sends the bot click to offer 1 (the bot detection offer).▸can be 1×1 pixel image, the text of the same (or very similar) colour as the background.▸should be placed very low on the page.This link is not visible to real visitors, but almost every type of Bot can click on it. So whenever you see clicks to our offer 1, you know that visitors are not real, it's from bots.



4. Add other multi-offer links to your landing page. For example, in our case, it is https://your.domain.com/click/2 – it sends real visitors to offer 2 (a real offer).5. After that, you can check your campaign reports and see what IPs (or UAs) have clicked on the trap offer and block them.



Check out the article Tracking listicles (multi-offer landing page) for more information on the correct landing page setup.

24,Cost/Ad spend: general,"
What's ad spend/campaign cost?



Campaign Cost (cost model) defines the cost of traffic you buy. CPM/CPC is good for most media-buying campaigns across Google, FB, etc. CPA/Revshare is good for affiliate/partner campaigns and CPA ad networks. 



With RedTrack, you have 2 ways of tracking the cost data:



1. Statically by adding the cost data to the tracking link or directly per campaign.



2. Dynamically: via the macro or with the help of the API for those traffic channels that support it.







This is the most obvious and simple way. You set the cost value per campaign in the campaign settings. Once the click/conversion comes, the cost is recorded automatically based on the cost model chosen:







Campaign cost models explaned:




CPC - the cost per each click.



CPA - the cost per conversion.



CPM / PopCPM - the cost for 1000 impressions, and it will not work for clicks.



RevShare - the % from each conversion revenue.



Do not track - no costs will be recorded.




Do Not Track cost model is designed for non-API integrated traffic channels. If you prefer not to receive ad spend data, switch off the ""Auto update costs"" toggle within your campaign settings:





You can set it up dynamically via the Macro or with the help of the API for those traffic channels that support it.



API



This type of integration is available for the integrated/automated traffic channels.



1. Check if your traffic channel is eligible for the API cost update.



2. Follow this guide to help you enable the Auto update cost feature. 



Auto-cost update feature will not work for CPM/CPA/Revshare campaigns.



Macro



If your traffic channel does not support the API cost update, you can try to do this with the help of the macro. This option works for the cases where the traffic channel you work with has the macro for the cost (bid, etc.).



Follow this guide for more info on the matter. 







Depending on your needs, you may set the customised campaign costs related to the additional values received for each clickid (subs, country, etc.). To do that within the added Campaign settings go to the tab Custom payouts → choose the needed payout type → add the values for your payouts → Save changes to the Custom payouts tab and the to the main campaign window:



CPA cost model custom payout sums should be represented by the fixed payout value.Revshare cost model custom payout sums should be represented by the percentage.The exception is the Hybrid cost model where:- if the cost model is CPA, the custom payout sum should be represented by the percentage- if the cost model is Revshare the custom payout sum should be represented by the fixed payout value.







Payout types explained:




GEO– set different payout based on click location.



GEO/OS&nbsp;– OS (without versions), Geo and payout amount separated by a comma with no spaces.



HYBRID&nbsp;– define conversion type to force change them to CPA (this could be helpful if you work with RevShare but want a CPA model for some conversion types).



CONVERSION SUBS&nbsp;– subid you receive with the conversion (sub1, sub2. etc.), sub value, and payout amount separated by a comma with no spaces.



TYPE/GEO/CONVSUB&nbsp;– conversion type, geo, subid you receive with the conversion, sub value, and payout amount separated by a comma with no spaces.



TYPE/CONVSUB – conversion type, subid you receive with the conversion and payout amount separated by a comma with no spaces. 




Conversion sub-parameters are the additional parameters you send with the conversion to enrich the data. They differ from click subs parameters string.



All other publisher-related options are to be used only in that case.

26,Payout/Revenue sync,"
Payout is the amount you get paid for the conversion.



With RedTrack you can track your conversions in 2 different ways: dynamically and statically. Act as per your choice:





This method offers you an effective and accurate method of tracking using a dynamic payout token or fixed value in your S2S postback URL or tracking pixel. If your affiliate network supports a dynamic payout token, it will send it back to RedTrack via your postback URL / pixel for each registered conversion via our supported&nbsp;{sum}&nbsp;parameter. 




Networks that have a preset template in RedTrack already have all the needed parameters added.





To add this parameter for the network from scratch go to Offer source → Postback parameters → place the payout tracking macro from your network into the SUM field:








The parameter will vary for each particular network, so please contact your Account manager for the correct one.



Here are some examples of postback URLs with dynamic tokens:▸ Everflow PB URL example: http://yourtrackingdomain?clickid={sub1}&amp;sum={payout_amount}▸ Affise PB URL example: http://rdtrck2.com/postback?clickid={sub1}&amp;sum={sum}▸ HasOffers PB URL example: http://rdtrck2.com/postback?clickid={aff_sub}&amp;sum={payout}▸ CAKE PB URL example: http://rdtrck2.com/postback?clickid=#s2#&amp;sum=#price#





This provides you with an alternative solution if dynamic payout macros aren’t supported by your affiliate network (or advertiser). You can record payout by using a fixed payout value in the offer settings. To set it up go to Offers → Main tab → set the payout value per each registered conversion in the Default conversion revenue field:






",https://help.redtrack.io/knowledgebase/kb/conversion-tracking/payout_tracking/,docs
28,Impressions,"
By impressions is meant the number of times your banner ad is viewed. When used with other tracking metrics, impressions give you a vital overview of your ad campaign performance: where you have more impressions and fewer click-throughs, or vice versa.



To use impression tracking, your traffic channel should support this option. Clarify it with your account manager.



Working with Impression URLs



1. Once you've created and saved the Campaign in RedTrack a Click URL (campaign link) and Impression URL are generated automatically. Copy both links and paste them to your traffic channel:











2. You will see the counted Impressions in a separate column of your Campaign report:









With RedTrack, in addition to impression tracking, you can now track visible impressions. While an ‘impression’ is&nbsp;counted every time a user&nbsp;loads a page with an impression pixel on it, a ‘Visible impression’ is counted even when a user had at least 50% of the ads on his screen for at least 1 second. It means now you have even more precise reports on how many ad impressions bring you clicks and conversions in the end.



Not all traffic channels support impression tracking, so check it first before activating impression tracking. RedTrack has integrated ad serving capabilities to ensure that visible impressions are actually visible. Please reach out to support@redtrack.io for details.



Visible impressions&nbsp; have a separate tracking URL and a separate column in reports:













This pixel can be placed on the page to track page impressions (page loads):

34,No redirect / redirectless tracking,"
What is no redirect tracking?



No redirect tracking method is the opposite of the redirect method. The principle of work comes from the name: there is no redirect from one link to another in the funnel. This tracking method is the only one accepted by such giants as Facebook, Google, and Bing. In simple words, it is when you use your landing page link or the direct link to your website for tracking, so the traffic goes directly to the target page without any additional redirects. The no redirect campaign is created&nbsp;the same way as the usual one, but you use your landing page/website URL instead of the campaign link.



In RedTrack, no redirect tracking can be implemented in 2 ways: via Universal tracking script + Tracking parameters (aka UTMs) or via No redirect script + Tracking parameters.



Universal tracking script vs no redirect script



ScenarioUniversal tracking scriptNo redirect scriptCan be used by affiliatesyesyesCan be used by advertisersyesyes (limited functionality)Can be used for e-comyesnoOrganic traffic trackingyes, separatelyyes, under the same campaignSeveral campaigns per LP/websiteyesnoSeveral traffic channels per LP/websiteyesno1st party cookieyesyesLP viewsyesyesLP clicksyesyesOnly offer campaignsyesno



To sum it up:




If you are an affiliate marketer working with a couple of traffic channels and use different landing pages in your funnels, the no redirect script will be an easy and smooth option to implement.



For advertisers and e-commerce shop owners, the universal tracking script is the best solution.




Important!Any RedTrack scripts must be added at the end of the body section. Otherwise, they might fail to trigger correctly.



How does it work?





This is a detailed guide on generating the universal tracking script and adjusting it according to your needs.





1. Create a Campaign and save it.



2. Tracking links and parameters → No-redirect → copy the script from your RedTrack campaign and add it to your landing page code (or website, depending on your flow):







3. To make the system work properly for the landing page click tracking, you will need to use the landing page click URL on the CTA button instead of the direct link to the offer. You can find it in the landing page edit window.











Make sure that both the script and offer click URL (your.domain.com/click) are present in the page source and have the same domain.



4. Copy the tracking parameters from your RedTrack campaign and add them to the appropriate field in the traffic channel (tracking template for Google, URL parameters for Facebook, etc.).







Some traffic channels have no separate tracking parameters field. In that case, add the parameters directly after the main URL (your landing page). Example: https://my.amazing.website.com?sub1={{ad.id}}&amp;sub2={{adset.id}}&amp;sub3={{campaign.id}}&amp;ad_name={{ad.name}}&amp;adset_name={{adset.name}}&amp;utm_source=mysource

46,Conversions: upload/update,"
If for some reason your conversions were not uploaded, RedTrack functionality allows you to upload them manually or update them as per your needs.





Before adding conversions know that:1. Once uploaded, conversions cannot be removed from your RedTrack statistics.2. Conversions in RedTrack can be uploaded via 2 options (see the steps below for details).



To upload conversions act as follows:



1. On the main RedTrack menu go to Logs → Conversions:







2. Decide on the option for the conversions upload and act on it:





Add conversions → in the pop-up window add the click ids for the missing conversions and the payouts → Save:









1. Upload → Download Template:







2. Open the downloaded .csv file → add the needed conversion click ids and the payout values for them:







3. Logs → Conversions → Upload → Upload Conversions → choose from your computer the .csv file with conversions you've created in step 2







Once the changes are saved, your conversion will appear in your conversion logs and reports.



Mind that when downloaded, the CSV file is automatically uploaded in the user's timezone, as conversions logs are always displayed in the user's timezone.Example: user’s account (GMT-4) - New York. We want to upload conversions and see their time in the logs 14:00:00. We put them in the file as 18:00:00. If the account is GMT+4, we want to see 14:00:00 in the logs, we put 10:00:00 in the file.



Make sure there are no duplicated clickids for the cases where you don't need to see duplicates in your reports. Use the most suitable option in the Duplicate postback mode section of your Offer source/Brand (Offer sources/Brands → choose the needed one among the added → scroll down to the Default duplicate postback mode section):For more info &amp; explanation on the postback modes go to this guide (How to set up conversion statuses→How to process duplicates). 







Payout



If you need to update the conversion data, it can be done the same way as a regular upload described above. The only thing you should keep in mind is that you will have to change the Duplicate postback mode in your offer source for RedTrack to update the data. To do that go to Offer sources → choose the needed one → scroll down to the Default duplicate postback mode section → select the needed mode:







Do not use Create a new conversion in this case, as it  will create a new conversion without editing the initial one.Here you can find more info on the duplicate postback modes. 



Status



To update the conversion status go to Logs → Conversions → Update status → add the click id of the conversion you need to update and choose the target status → Save:

50,Protecting your postbacks,"
RedTrack developed 2 special features: Postback protection and Whitelist IPs that allow protecting your link from fraudulent conversions in your CPA campaigns.



To set them up follow the steps below:



Postback protection



1. Add your offer source (either from the template or a custom one).



2. In your Offer source setting enable the Postback protection toggle: 







3. Once you've enabled it, you will see the unique ptoken value is added to the Postback URL template → copy the ptoken value → save changes to the template:







4. In order to work properly, the protected postback URL with the unique ptoken should be obligatorily inserted to the offer source (affiliate network, advertiser) postback settings.



If this feature is enabled, each conversion will be checked against the uniqueness of ""ptoken"", in case it does not match, a conversion will be ignored by RedTrack.



Whitelist IP



Whitelist IP feature allows to record only certain conversions that came from a certain IP or IP range. To set it up:



1. Add your offer source (either from the template or a custom one).



2. Scroll down the template → enable the Whitelist IP toggle → paste the needed IP address → save changes to the template:







Once it's enabled, conversions with different IPs (IP ranges) will be ignored by RedTrack.

52,"Conversion tracking: types, statuses, duplicates","
In RedTrack conversion events tracking can be set up via types or statuses. Each way has its peculiarities:  



TypeStatus- allows custom naming- has extended analytics- works with API integrations- extended Clickbank, Google and Tiktok mapping supported- needs additional setup in the interface- no custom naming- limited analytics- is not suitable for API integrations and conversion mapping- works without any additional setup- works for COD offers



Conversion statuses do not work for the traffic channels with the API integrations (Facebook, Google, Bing). For such cases use conversion types event tracking method instead.



General advice is to use types as they work the same way and allow more customization.



Act depending on the preferred event tracking way:





How to set up



1. Tools → Conversion tracking → Conversion type → add the events you want to track → Save:











The fields are case-sensitive. The name should be exactly what you plan to send to RedTrack.The names remain the same and will be sent to the traffic channel exactly as you've added them to RedTrack.



2. For the added event to be tracked you need to add type=Conversion_Event_Name to the Postback URL. For example: https://my.postback.com/postback?clickid={sub}&amp;type=Upsell. 



The way to track the added events may differ depending on your flow, but the main principle is appending the desired type parameter to the postback. If your flow differs turn to the specific guide on KB or email to support@redtrack.io for assistance. 



How the tracked conversions are shown in RedTrack



Data on conversions recorded in RedTrack can be viewed in the reports: 





If you want the assigned events to be counted and shown in the Customer Journey report, you have to enable the report next to the event:







To choose more than 2 conversion types to be depicted in the Customer Journey report, you need to upgrade your subscription plan. Refer to the Customer Journey report guide for details. 





You can check the data on the added conversion events as follows:




In&nbsp;reports,&nbsp;once you’ve added the columns with the names of your conversion events:













In logs by conversions, you can check out the data on the duplicate status of the conversion event with the assigned duplicate postback mode Create new conversion: new or repeated:








New for the first conversion.Repeated for the repeated (duplicated) conversions.Unknown for conversions with this postback mode not configured.







How to set up



Conversion statuses are used in cases where using simple naming is enough for you. They are added within the Offer source/Brand template in RT, we have 4 types of Statuses:




other



approved



pending



declined




All of the statuses are available as separate columns with separate statistics. The main difference between types is that you cannot change the status naming, it is only like that.We recommend using the approved status as the default to avoid editing the Postback URL and simplifying the process.



1. When adding the offer source/brand,&nbsp;choose the Approved status under the section Conversion status → Save:







If we do not receive any status data with the conversion, by default, we record all conversions with the status you have set in the offer source/brand settings, which can easily be changed.



2. Once you’ve saved the changes, copy the generated postback URL and paste it to your affiliate network account under the target postback field (or use it wherever you plan to):







Change the status manually per postback if you need to send another one. Use lowercase. 



How the tracked conversions with statuses are shown in RedTrack



Conversions with the assigned statuses can be tracked in the offer source report, once you add the column with the status name to the report table:













RedTrack offers a handy Duplicate postback mode functionality that manages how the platform processes multiple postback requests for the same conversion event. You can assign a dedicated duplicate postback mode to the chosen event type/ status and the system will act accordingly (create a new conversion, ignore the postback, edit conversion with new data, etc.). 



Duplicate postback modes can be applied to both types and statuses, but you should know that the duplicate postback mode set in conversion types prevails over the one set via statuses in your offer source/brand template. 



Act as per your way of setting up the conversion tracking (types or statuses):





To apply a certain duplicate mode select it from the dropdown menu on the right next to the needed event type → Save:







Duplicate postback modes explained:



With API-integrated traffic channels when you apply duplicate postback modes, the conversion is also updated API-based.  How it works: chosen duplicate postback mode is applied → conversion is updated in RedTrack → the updated conversion is sent to the traffic channel where the system recognizes this conversion by its clickid and edits this very conversion without creating any duplicates.




Create new conversion:&nbsp;duplicate postback data will be added as a separate conversion.



Create new conversion: new or repeated: means duplicated postback data will be added as a separate conversion with different statuses.– New for the first conversion.– Repeated for the repeated (duplicated) conversions.– Unknown for conversions in which this postback mode is not configured.





Ignore duplicate postbacks:&nbsp;no data on the duplicate will be added.



Edit conversion with new data:&nbsp;the original conversion&nbsp;will be edited with new data.




When you apply the “Edit conversion with new data” mode, only payout can be updated, time of the conversion can’t be changed.



ExampleYou have a lead conversion that can transform into either a purchase or rejection later. You want to receive first the Lead, and send the data about this to the traffic channel, then you want the Lead to be changed to Purchase, also with sending the data to the traffic channel. In that case, edit conversion with the new data is the postback mode you need.




Keep original data, Increment payout: only revenue will be edited.




Use this mode for tracking upsells for example.




Ignore duplicate postbacks by event id: to make this mode work, first, you need to send RedTrack the unique id for the system to be able to compare the data. For example, adding rdtk_event_id={replace} to the postback URL. It can be an order id/transaction id or something of this matter by which RedTrack will implement the deduplication. Once this mode is applied, no data by the mentioned event id will be added to the tracking report.






To set it up go to the added Offer source /Brand template → scroll down to the&nbsp;Default duplicate postback mode&nbsp;section → choose the needed mode → Save the changes to the template:







Default duplicate postback modes explained:

54,"Conversion tracking: S2S, script, API","


RedTrack offers you the following methods of conversion tracking:




API



S2S



Pixel/script




API



API conversion tracking method is based on the integration of the RedTrack API with the platform storing your conversion data (affiliate network, CRM, shop, website, etc.). This is the most reliable conversion tracking method because it happens on the backend of both platforms.&nbsp;When a conversion occurs, this platform pings RedTrack with all the necessary information. However, since this method requires a lot more development work on both sides, it is not very common in affiliate marketing, and not all the systems support it.



API method in a nutshell:




It's the most reliable method of passing the conversion. It does not need cookies to work.



It's a “set it and forget it” method. Once you complete the integration, you won't need to configure anything.&nbsp;Conversions will be shared along with additional information such as payout.



It can be challenging to implement.




These are the platforms RedTrack has the API integration with:




CJ Affiliate



ClickBank



WooCommerce



Shopify




S2S



Server-to-server (S2S) postback is a very accurate method of receiving and sending conversion data. S2S tracking saves the information about the user ID directly to the server of all the systems involved in the flow. When a user clicks on an ad, this click is recorded and gets a newly generated unique ID for this session. If a user buys or orders something, RedTrack receives a message from another system about the conversion that happened. This is a standard option available for everyone. No additional settings are required.




It provides slightly accurate tracking and accurate statistics. This tracking method does not rely on cookies.&nbsp;Therefore, it works even if the visitor has blocked the collection of cookie data in their web browser.&nbsp;That is why it is considered one of the most reliable tracking methods.



Postback tracking must be supported by your affiliate network/shop/CRM.




Check out our video review on S2S postbacks.





S2S tracking is the most common for Affiliate Networks. Depending on the network you work with, the process of integrating it with RedTrack differs:





1. Add the Offer source template to RedTrack → Save it:











2. Copy the Postback URL from the settings:







3. Paste the copied Postback URL to your affiliate network account under the postback settings





1. Offer sources → new from scratch:







2. Give your custom Offer source a name, and clarify the correct CLICKID and SUM macros essential for tracking. Once you've added them, press Save:







3. Copy the generated Postback URL:







4. Paste it to your affiliate network/advertiser account under the postback settings



With S2S postback you can use conversion types. They are set in your RedTrack account: Tools → Conversion tracking → Conversion types. After you set the names, simply add &amp;type=conversion event name to the end of your postback URL.







The following CRM systems are possible to integrate with RedTrack via the S2S postbacks:




Typeform



Konnektive






Pixel/postback script



Conversion tracking using pixel/postback script is the simplest and least accurate method. You place a piece of code on your ""Thank you"" page and each time the visitor opens this page, the conversion is fired with the help of the script. That means the same visitor can refresh the page and the pixel will then be fired once again so you may receive a duplicate.



Pros:




You can use it if the S2S option is not available.



It’s the ultimate solution when you don’t have many technical resources and have your own “thank you page”.



Pixel/postback script is simple and fast to implement and use, so there is no need to be a technical expert. You copy the pixel from the tracker and paste it into the code of the last page that the user sees after the conversion has occurred.




Cons:




Sometimes pixels may not work.&nbsp;One reason for this could be the user clearing the cache between clicking a link on the landing page and the actual conversion.&nbsp;In this case, the conversion will simply not be tracked



Apple has implemented Smart Tracking Protection 2.0 in Safari, preventing websites from tracking user activity without permission. Currently, the website can request tracking permission, but the user must specifically register. Even if the user consents to be tracked by Safari on their own, after 30 days all data and cookies will be permanently deleted. In general, pixel tracking is a fairly complex process when working with Safari



Google has announced that its Chrome web browser will no longer support third-party cookies from 2022, which will, of course cause pixel tracking issues and make a simple pixel/script a solution only for the redirect tracking










Important!The script has to be added at the end of the body section. Otherwise, it might fail to trigger correctly.





1. Tools → Conversion Tracking → stay on the tab Conversion Tracking:







2.&nbsp;RedTrack generates a unique pixel with your dedicated tracking domain but you can change it to a custom tracking domain. To change the domain press on the Domain field in the Conversion postback domain section and choose the needed domain from the dropdown list of the added ones:



It does not matter what domain you will be using in your postback as the visitor will not see it and it is required only for server-side tracking. So you can leave the dedicated tracking domain there.







3. Activate the toggle Show pixel for statuses (Pending, Approved, Declined, Other) to use statuses to track changes in the conversion status in COD and similar scenarios:







4. Copy any of the available options: Pixel postback code for conversion (in the Conversion tracking pixel section) or Postback script (preferred option in the Postback script section):







The ""type"" parameter is to be added manually. Type should equal the one you have set in your conversion type settings. For example:&lt;img src=""//domain.rdtk.io/postback?format=img&amp;sum={replace}&amp;type=Purchase"" width=""1"" height=""1"" />



5. Paste the copied ready-to-use pixel to your Thank You page to track visitors' activity.





1. Use the Universal Tracking Script to capture the click data.



It captures the tracking parameters, sends them back to RedTrack, generates the clickid and saves it in the first-party cookie rtkclickid-store



2. Adjust the script below.



It reads the first-party cookie value and adds it to the postback URL. Modify the&nbsp;postback URL → replace https://custom.tracking.domain with your custom tracking domain:



// Function to read a cookie by its name
function getCookie(cookieName) {
  var name = cookieName + ""="";
  var decodedCookie = decodeURIComponent(document.cookie);
  var cookieArray = decodedCookie.split(';');

  for (var i = 0; i &lt; cookieArray.length; i++) {
    var cookie = cookieArray&#91;i];
    while (cookie.charAt(0) == ' ') {
      cookie = cookie.substring(1);
    }
    if (cookie.indexOf(name) == 0) {
      return cookie.substring(name.length, cookie.length);
    }
  }
  return """";
}

// Get the value of the ""rtkclickid-store"" cookie
var rtCookieValue = getCookie(""rtkclickid-store"");

// Construct the URL with the cookie value appended
var baseUrl = ""https://custom.tracking.domain/postback""; // Replace with your actual URL
var urlWithCookie = baseUrl + ""?clickid="" + encodeURIComponent(rtCookieValue);

// Make a request to the URL
fetch(urlWithCookie)
  .then(response =&gt; {
    if (response.ok) {
      // Handle the response if needed
      return response.text();
    } else {
      throw new Error(""Request failed with status: "" + response.status);
    }
  })
  .then(data =&gt; {
    // Process the response data here
    console.log(""Response data: "" + data);
  })
  .catch(error =&gt; {
    // Handle any errors that occurred during the fetch
    console.error(""Fetch error: "" + error);
  });



The getCookie function reads the value of the ""rtkclickid-store” cookie. Then the cookie value is appended to the base postback URL to create the final URL with the query parameter clickid. The fetch API is used to make a GET request to the URL, so you can handle the response and any errors as needed.

105,Custom domain for tracking,"
Why do you need a custom tracking domain?



Custom tracking domain&nbsp;is essential for tracking. Such giants as Google, Facebook, or Bing do not accept default tracking domains, thus, using a custom tracking domain prevents your campaigns from being blocked.



Another good reason is to replace the default dedicated tracking RedTrack domain with something that belongs to you only. 



Using custom tracking domain helps you to:




control your traffic better;



protect you from being blocked by the traffic channel;



have more control over the cases when your custom domain is compromised so you can easily update it to the new one.




The difference between a custom tracking domain (you should add) and a dedicated domain (RT gives you by default) is explained here.



How to add a custom tracking domain to RedTrack





To add the custom tracking domain, you will need to have a purchased domain. It can be obtained from anywhere. Examples of the most commonly used domain registrars are Godaddy, Namecheap, Cloudflare, etc.



You don't need a separate custom tracking domain for each website/online store/client. It's enough to use one custom tracking domain for all the websites you integrate with RedTrack or use many for each.





1. Add a CNAME record in your registrar. Settings will depend on the system you are using. Below are the most commonly used:





1.&nbsp;Go to&nbsp;Manage&nbsp;DNS → Add:







2.&nbsp;Fill in the fields → Add record:







Fields explained:✎Type: CNAME✎Name: it can be anything you like. This is the word that will be placed at the beginning of your domain (e.g: mytracking.domain.com)✎Value: your RedTrack dedicated tracking domain here (Tools → Domains → New ):✎TTL: the lowest possible





1.&nbsp; Select the domain where you want to add the CNAME record → DNS&nbsp;→ Add record:







2. Fill in the details:







Fields explained:✎Type: CNAME✎Name: it can be anything you like. This is the word that will be placed at the beginning of your domain (e.g: mytracking.domain.com);✎Target: your RedTrack dedicated tracking domain✎Proxy status: DNS only✎TTL: the lowest possible



 When managing your DNS with Cloudflare, make sure to use the ""DNS only"" Proxy status instead of ""Proxied"":If ""Proxied"" is on, that means the traffic will not go to RedTrack directly but first to the Cloudflare servers. In that case, RedTrack is not responsible for the domain's proper work. Click here to learn more about DNS records management in Cloudflare.





1. &nbsp;Domain List → &nbsp;Manage:







2. Advanced DNS&nbsp;→&nbsp;Add new record:







Fill in the needed details:







Fields explained:✎Type: CNAME✎Name: it can be anything you like. This is the word that will be placed at the beginning of your domain (e.g: mytracking.domain.com)✎Value: your RedTrack dedicated tracking domain here (Tools → Domains → New ):✎TTL: the lowest possibleClick here for more info about DNS management via Namecheap.





Follow the&nbsp;dedicated Shopify guide.





The domain will be updated and ready to use once the data replication is completed. In general, it takes about an hour, but in the case of some registrars, it can take up to 24 hours.



▸ Make sure there isn't an already created CNAME record for the same host, as it will lead to a conflict.▸ Do not remove the CNAME record from your DNS settings as long as you are using it, as without it, your custom tracking domain won’t work properly.



2. Once the CNAME record is added, add the custom tracking domain to RedTrack. 



Tools →&nbsp;Domains →&nbsp;New:







Fill in the fields:








(1) URL: sub-domain you have just added to your registrar (example: mytracking.domain.com)




In the example ilona.redtrackfan.club:- ilona is the name you put in your domain registrar in the field “Name”.- redtrackfan.club is the domain you have purchased and for which you added the CNAME.




(2) Root domain: here, you can put the URL visitors will be redirected to in case of a direct entry to the domain URL, or you can leave it blank. 




In case you still decide to put the root domain there, remember to type in https:// in front of it.




(3) Install the SSL: turn on the toggle to enable the free SSL certificate.




RedTrack provides free SSL certificates for all paid clients, where everything can now be done in one click. We are extra cautious about our service, so RedTrack generates certificates using open-source Let’s Encrypt technology, which claims to be free, automated, and open certificate authority (CA) run for the public’s benefit (it is a service provided by the Internet Security Research Group (ISRG)).

114,Adding Landing page,"
Landing page (aka LP / lander / prelander / gift page etc.) in terms of RedTrack is the page prior to your main offer page with the target product promoted. It needs to be editable, meaning, if your Affiliate Network provided you with a Landing page and Offer but you cannot edit the page code, then this is not a Landing page in terms of RedTrack settings.





Landing pages and their settings are kept in&nbsp;Funnels. A sales funnel is a series of landing pages that are intentionally crafted to make sales or get leads. Each page in a sales funnel is meant to drive a visitor to the next page with the end goal being conversion.



Example 1: The Landing page provided by the Affiliate Network / Advertiser / your own (you have access to the page code) → Offer URL (the product page either provided by the affiliate network or your own product) → “Thank you” page.Explanation: a. LP is added to RedTrack, and the page core is adjusted accordingly.b. Offer is added to RedTrack.Example 2: The Landing page provided by the Affiliate Network / Advertiser / your own (you have no access to the page code) → Offer URL (the product page either provided by the affiliate network or your own product) → “Thank you” pageExplanation:In this example the LP URL will act as the Offer, so you add only the Offer.



With RedTrack you can track the following types of funnels and combinations within them:




Standard funnels: tracking link → offer.



Standard funnel with a landing page: tracking link → landing page → offer.



Standard funnel with a landing page without a tracking link: landing page → offer.



All types of standard funnels with your own offers: … → offer → “thank you” page where the conversion fires.



Listicle funnels with or without a tracking link: listicle landing page → offers.



Listicle funnels with or without a tracking link with your own offers: listicle landing page → offers → “thank you” page where the conversion fires.



Multi-funnels with or without a tracking link: 1 landing page → 2 landing page → offer.



Multi-funnels with or without a tracking link with your own offers: 1 landing page → 2 landing page → offer → “thank you” page where the conversion fires.



The traffic of your own website: offer.




To learn more about funnels, follow these articles:- Multi-step funnel setup- Funnel auto-optimization (AI)





To add your Landing page act as follows:



1. On the main RedTrack menu go to Landers&nbsp;→&nbsp;Create new lander:







2. Fill in the mandatory fields → Save to apply the changes:







Fields explained:





Give your landing page a name.





Once you've chosen the needed landing page type, Click URL field is filled in automatically with the correct URL syntax depending on the selected type. Pay special attention to the hints under the Click URL fields:













1. Paste the URL of your landing page into this field:







2. If you need to improve your page and make it more personal ( i.e show subs, traffic channel name, the visitor’s city, OS, etc.) you can add additional dynamic parameters to your URL string:







Follow these guides to learn more about dynamic parameters in RedTrack:  - Dynamic parameters: show on page  - Dynamic parameters



DISCLAIMER! This is just a sample (ready-to-use) script, but if you need to use your script, you can write it on your own, our dynamic values will work well with any script.Example:1. Add the desired dynamic parameter to your page URL:2. Now you are ready to parse and use it where needed. Put this script to your page code where you want this value to change:&lt;script type=""text/javascript""> var parameterName; function getParameterData(name) { var query = window.location.search.substring(1); var vars = query.split(""&amp;""); for (var i=0;i&lt;vars.length;i++) { var pair = vars[i].split(""=""); if(pair[0] === name){ return decodeURI(pair[1]);} } return """"; } parameterName = getURLParameter('city') &lt;/script>Here is the example of the Landing page and pending page code with this script used:





In order to appear in the drop-down, your custom tracking domain has to be added first. 



Tracking script and /click URL should have the same custom tracking domain.



The selected tracking domain is duplicated to the Click URL field:









Press Show more if you want to add tags to certain landing page templates so that you can distinguish them in the lp list. Tags article will help you with details. 





Press Save to apply the changes to your landing page template.





3. Add the corresponding scripts to your landing page code:





For RedTrack to identify your Landing page and perform the redirect to the offer correctly (with tracking and sending all the necessary data further), you need to 



1. Copy the Click URL script and LP views script:







2. Paste them as follows:




LP Click URL is supposed to be added to the CTA (call to action) button instead of the offer URL. No worries, RedTrack will know where to redirect the visitor even if there is no direct offer URL used on the page.



LP views tracking script should be added to the head section of the page code.




Example of the page with a CTA button:The page code setting may look like a simple setup, you see the LP Views tracking script and LP Click URL:





For RedTrack to identify your Landing page and perform the no redirect tracking to the offer correctly (with tracking and sending all the necessary data further), you need to:



3.1 Copy the Click URL:







3.2 Paste it to the CTA (call to action) button instead of the offer URL. Don’t worry. RedTrack will know where to redirect the visitor even if no direct offer URL is used on the page.



3.3 Add the tracking script to the head section of the page code. The tracking script is taken from the Campaign settings. More info can be found here.



Example of the page with a CTA button:







The flow the visitor goes through is the following: сlicks the ad on some website → the click goes through the tracking link (or directly to the landing page you use direct traffic script) → visitor lands on the landing page and clicks on the CTA button. Thus:




Landing page views&nbsp;are the number of visitors who saw your landing page.



Landing page clicks&nbsp;are the number of visitors who clicked on the CTA button.




Both LP views and LP clicks data are available in your reports.





Ideally, LP views and clicks number should be equal but there are reasons it may differ:




a lot of people are using antiviruses and adblockers;



slow internet connection so the visitors&nbsp; prefer not to wait for the page to load;



slow redirects (it’s quite a rare case but still – the click may go from Brazil server on a traffic source side and the target offer is on Singapore server so the clicks are physically lost during this long way).




That’s why it’s important to see how many clicks converted to LP views. This can be done by using the LP views tracking script or the&nbsp;no-redirect&nbsp;script.



Do not use both as they may conflict.




No-redirect script example:









LP views tracking script example:










To be able to see LP clicks and for the correct redirect to the offer, an LP click URL should be used on your landing page. This click URL is to be placed to the CTA button instead of the offer URL. RedTrack will know how and where to redirect the visitor.



Adding LP click URL to the CTA button is obligatory for all campaigns with landing pages. Otherwise, the information on the visitor will not be sent to the affiliate network and you will not be able to see the conversion data in RedTrack.



Example of the LP click URL:











Listicle&nbsp;in affiliate marketing is a landing page with a list of different offers on it, usually with some kind of extra detail to each item. Each offer has a separate button and leads to a different product. Thus, if you have a landing page that contains links to multiple Offers with a separate button each, you can track their performance in RedTrack.



To set up listicle tracking act as follows:



1. When adding your landing page choose the type&nbsp;Listicle landing:







2. Add your&nbsp;offers&nbsp;to RedTrack→ create a&nbsp;Campaign&nbsp;→ within campaign settings add the target landing page and the offers to the funnel:







3. Go to your landing page editor and add separate LP click URLs to the CTA buttons for each offer accordingly.&nbsp;The template will be as follows and can be found in the&nbsp;added landing page&nbsp;settings anytime:







For example, if you have 3 offers, you need to add 3 click URL links to your landing page code:




https://tracking.domain.com/click/1&nbsp;



https://tracking.domain.com/click/2&nbsp;



https://tracking.domain.com/click/3&nbsp;




In this case, RedTrack will redirect any visitor to the corresponding offer depending on the chosen CTA button.&nbsp;



The number of offers in the campaign settings should equal the number of click URLs (your.tracking.domain/click/1) you put on your landing page. The order of your offers in the funnel settings should correspond to the links (your.tracking.domain/click/1) with numbers you add to your landing page.

355,Landing page protection,"
What is landing page protection and why?



Protecting a landing page from a spy is becoming more and more popular and important nowadays. RedTrack gives you options on how to hide your funnel a little bit in both cases:





You have found a nice way to promote a 3rd party product and for sure want to hide the winning combination from those who plan to ""rip and run"". You cannot hide the landing page or creatives but you can hide the offer which makes the ""rip and run"" process complicated since without the target offer landing page information is useless.



Since the clicks from the ads library do not have the real dynamic parameters, only the FB clickid, you can filter those empty parameters in RedTrack to be redirected somewhere else (google.com for instance).



1. Set up the fallback URL.



Tools → Fallback URL → Add anything you want. This is where the non-matching traffic is going to be redirected. It can be a Facebook page, google search, some other offer you promote but not from that campaign, etc.







2. In your RedTrack Campaign settings go to the funnel filters → add filter → Subs → Exclude → scroll down to the sub6 and place {{campaign.name}} in the field:







Now all the traffic that comes with the empty default {{campaign.name}} parameter will be redirected to the fallback URL. You can add also other empty dynamic parameters but also the one we suggest is enough.





By using this method, a user will be able to visit the landing for 5 minutes only. After that, the same user will not be able to do that. Your landing page will be opened for the real entries but not for the repetitive ones.



Example:



This is a direct tracking link (Click URL) which users can always have access to:https://tracking.domain.com/5c5808c2ec173600012aa1da?sub1={pln}&amp;sub2={uid}&amp;sub3={crid}&amp;sub4={plid}&amp;sub5={campaign}&amp;sub6={cc}&amp;sub7={isp}&amp;sub8={country}&amp;sub9={ip}&amp;ref_id={clickid}&amp;cost=1When you click on it, you are redirected to a page with a URL like this:http://your-landing-page-url.com/?lpkey=ab53ff920f5569d54e6d5d0ecb803774.1549368473&amp;rdtrckcbp=1549368173



However, when you try to access this page without a tracking link by сlicking http://your-landing-page-url.com, you will only see a blank page:



1. Add&nbsp;?lpkeyua={lpkeyua}&nbsp;at the end of your landing page URL.



2. Landers → Edit → Optional settings → LP protect script → copy the LP protect script (it is the same for all of your landing pages) to your landing page body. 



The script works only with a .php extension. Make sure your hosting supports .php. 


",https://help.redtrack.io/knowledgebase/kb/tracker-setup-for-affiliates/landing-pages/landing-page-protect/,docs
368,Direct linking,"
Direct linking means sending the traffic directly to the offer. So you are not using any landing pages, only the tracking link.



To add direct linking campaign act as follows:



1. Add the offer source and the offer you are promoting.



2. Add the traffic channel you will be using for buying traffic.



3. Create a Campaign. Use the Offer option in the Funnel→ add your offers: 







Proceed further with the other campaign settings→  Save the changes in your campaign settings. Once you save the campaign, the tracking link is already generated for you in the Tracking links and parameters section→ grab the tracking link and put it to the campaign settings on your network (traffic source) side:







This method is called direct linking since you are not using any other landing pages and scripts, just the tracking link that leads directly to the offer.
",https://help.redtrack.io/knowledgebase/kb/tracker-setup-for-affiliates/affiliates-campaigns-9848/direct-linking-campaign/,docs
372,Campaign for organic traffic,"
Organic/unattributed traffic is those visitors that land on your website from unpaid sources, essentially free traffic. To spot this traffic in RedTrack, you need to have a separate campaign for it.



Campaigns with paid traffic contain tracking parameters (for example, cmpid=62593afd6ef9dd0001221f51), meaning we already know to which traffic these clicks are attributed. Thus, for the unpaid traffic (unattributed/organic traffic) to be attributed somehow, you need to create a default campaign to collect info about all the clicks coming without the tracking parameters and to differentiate this traffic from the paid campaign. 



To create this campaign, act as follows:



1. Create a traffic channel unrelated to any paid channels.



Traffic channels&nbsp;→ New from template →  Other → Add → in the name field, add your website's name or go creative, but remember to distinguish this traffic channel somehow (put Other, for example) to tell it from the regular added campaigns:







2. Add the offer source and offer.



Your website or lander will act as the offer, and the offer source can have the same name. Name it accordingly so you can differentiate it later. 



3. Create a new campaign as a regular campaign and save it. 



The traffic channel is the one added for the organic traffic, and offer/lander+offer is your website URL (depending on the funnel you have).



4. Generate/copy the universal script associated with this campaign and paste it on your website if you are installing this script for the first time. 



Your campaign for organic traffic is ready. It is used for the universal tracking script as the default campaign. This allows the script to attribute all the clicks (and conversions generated from those clicks) without the parameters to the organic campaign.

374,Cost/Ad spend: manual update,"
Ad spend/costs in RedTrack mean the cost of your clicks, impressions, or conversions (if you work with the CPA model) you pay to your source of traffic.



In RedTrack, you can update your campaign costs in just a few clicks right from the RedTrack interface. This option is available for campaigns with the following cost models:




CPC (cost per click)



CPM (cost per 1000 impressions)



PopCPM (cost per 1000 pops)




To enable the cost update feature:



1. Campaigns → select the campaign →  Update costs:







2. Fill in the needed fields → Apply:







Fields explained:1. Choose the time frame.2. Add the target cost for that period.(optional) 3. Your traffic source subid. The value you receive from the source of traffic under this particular subid in RedTrack, for example, Ad ID.(optional) 4. The exact subid value your traffic source sends to RedTrack (for example, AD ID can be 23456677865).5. Apply changes to the campaign.☛ Subids data are added to redistribute the cost data also among them, allowing accurate granular reporting and KPIs.



The cost you enter here will be distributed among all clicks for the chosen period. Updates occur as often as every five minutes. The time in the cost update window matches your account timezone.
",https://help.redtrack.io/knowledgebase/kb/cost-tracking/cost-update/,docs
376,Multi-step funnel setup,"
Multi-step funnel presupposes using several landing pages one after another. It goes like this: Prelanding page→ Landing page→ Offer page→ ""Thank you"" page.



To set it up act as follows:



1. Add your prelander and lander to your account. Both prelander and lander are added the same way, just remember to choose the correct landing page type. The only difference will be in the LP click URLs and scripts.





Link from LP 1 to LP 2 (for the prelander): https://your.tracking.domain/preclick









Link LP 2 to the Offer (for the lander): https://your.tracking.domain/click







The scripts for prelanders&nbsp;have different structures.




No redirect campaign script:&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""https://your.domain.com/pretrack.js?rtkcmpid=your campaign id""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;





LP Views tracking script (for campaigns with LP and redirect tracking):&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""//your.domain.com/pretrack.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;






2. Choose Pre-landing - Landing - Offer option in your campaign funnel → add your pre-landing and landing pages:







3. Proceed further with the campaign creation as usual.

378,A/B (split) testing,"
A/B testing (also known as split testing) is showing two variants of the same page to different segments of visitors at the same time and comparing which variant converts better.



A/B testing works only with redirect tracking, that’s why this functionality won’t be useful for campaigns with such traffic channels as Google Ads, Facebook, and others requiring no-redirect tracking.



With the help of RedTrack you can perform complex A/B testing based on landing pages and/or offers. It is possible to add as many landing pages and offers to your funnel as you want and also set different weights. Like that, you can ""play"" with the data and then check extended 5-level reports to find out which of the funnels converts better.



For example, in this setup, we can check which of the landing page + offer combination will convert better (or probably, sending a visitor directly to the offer works best).











Here we rotate 3 landing pages and the offer first (once someone clicks on your tracking link, he will land on either one of the landing pages or on the offer directly). After that, 3 offers are rotated within the first funnel. At the same time, different weights are set as an additional tool to route your traffic. As soon as we start receiving the first conversions, we can use our extended reports to check, what funnel works better:

380,Conversions: conditional postback,"
What's a conditional postback in RedTrack?



Conditional postback is a rule you set for sending the conversion data back to your traffic source.



Some affiliate networks allow tracking several conversion events (sign-up, deposit, pending, approved, lead. etc.) and sending us this data in the postback URL. Or maybe you work with your own website and track different types of events?



But if you work with CPA campaigns, you might need to send only the paid leads to your source of traffic. At the same time, it might be useful to receive all possible conversion events for a better analysis. In this case, a conditional postback is the best option.



Conditional postback can be set based on conversion statuses and conversion types:



Conditional postback is the sort of filtering, so if you choose both conversion status and conversion type at the same time, the postback will be fired only when 2 of those conditions are met.



How to set up conditional postback?





To set a condition to fire the postback only for a certain conversion type act as follows:



1. Add the needed conversion type(s).



2. Go to your Campaign edit window → S2S Postback for &lt;your source&gt; section → Add → activate Conditional postback toggle → choose the conversion type → Save changes to the campaign:













If we do not receive any status data with the conversion, by default, we record all conversions with the status you have set in the offer source/brand settings, which can easily be changed.



To set a condition to fire the postback only for a certain status condition act as follows:



1. Set the conversion status in your offer source/brand.



2. Go to Campaigns → S2S Postback for &lt;your source&gt; section → Add → activate Conditional postback toggle → choose the conversion status →  Save changes to the campaign:











If chosen, the postback only for the target conversion status will be sent.





The same as with the S2S, API integration also allows sending only chosen conversion types to Google, Facebook, TikTok, or Bing. 



Go to your Campaign → API Integration postback → activate Conditional postback toggle → choose the condition → save the changes:




To add the custom conversion type select it from the Choose conversion types to postback dropdown:









To add the status, select it from the Postback when conversion statuses dropdown:







",https://help.redtrack.io/knowledgebase/kb/conversion-tracking/conditional-postback/,docs
384,Unique clicks,"
RedTrack can help you filter your clicks by their uniqueness and define the number of unique clicks.





Uniqueness of the click (Unique or Non-Unique) is defined by the following criteria:




Unique click = there IS an rt clickid in the cookie. 



Non-unique click = there is NO rt clickid in the cookie. 




Сlickid is kept in the cookie only for 24 hours.



To filter your clicks by uniqueness go to Logs → Clicks → add the Uniqueness columns: 







Once the data on clicks uniqueness comes, it'll be depicted under the Uniqueness column of the clicks report: 









Unique clicks are the number of unique visitors for one particular campaign. You can check unique clicks for each Campaign.



To filter the number of unique clicks per campaign go to Campaigns → add the Unique Clicks column → choose the campaign(s) where you want to see the data from: 







Once the data on unique clicks comes, it'll be depicted in the Unique clicks column of the campaign report:






",https://help.redtrack.io/knowledgebase/kb/conversion-tracking/unique-clicks-tracking/,docs
386,Multi-user access,"
The multi-user access feature allows several users to work in one RedTrack account. This is essential when you have a team where everyone needs access to edit the data or even different levels of access (for example based on Traffic channels). Each invited user will have access to your account (Admin account) and you (Admin) will be able to manage the performance of each user.



For more on available subscription plans and costs study RedTrack Pricing section. In case of any confusion or extra questions on the price range please contact sales@redtrack.io.



To invite a new user to RedTrack, act as follows:



1. A user needs to sign up to RedTrack via&nbsp;https://app.redtrack.io/signup&nbsp;or sign in to the already existing account.



2. Once it’s done, contact support@redtrack.io to change the user's status to Shared. When you've got confirmation that the user's status was changed, proceed further with step 3 below.



3. Go to your RedTrack account→ press on the burger menu→ Multiaccess→ New button:







4.&nbsp;Fill in the user profile and access details



4.1 Type in the user's email→ turn on the toggle Show financial data to reveal the financial data (or turn the toggle off to hide it)→ choose the elements that will be accessible for the shared user within your account:







☝ Full access provides the ability to see and edit all data in your RedTrack account.☝ Selected access type will be applied to all elements from the list. If you switch the ""Campaign view"" toggle off, the Campaigns tab will not be available for this user. If it is required to use ""read-only"" mode, you can switch ""Edit"" and ""Export"" toggles off. RedTrack tabs will be available only in view mode.



4.2 If you want your users to work with individual Traffic channels, Campaigns, or Affiliate networks, you can limit access by them:







Let's break down the logic of the limited access based on the Traffic channels in the screenshot above:




If you add Facebook and TikTok traffic channelsto the ""By Traffic Channels"" field, &nbsp;then in the ""By Campaigns"" field you can select only the Campaigns that were created with the added Traffic channels Facebook and TikTok.



""By Campaigns"" field depends on the ""By Traffic Channels""&nbsp;field, so if you delete Facebook and TikTok channels from the&nbsp;""By Traffic Channels"" field, then the Campaigns that refer to these traffic channels are also automatically deleted from the ""By Campaigns"" field.



""By Traffic Channels""&nbsp;field does not depend on the ""By Campaigns"" field, so if you delete&nbsp;Campaigns that refer to Facebook ad TikTok from the ""By Campaigns"" field, they won't be deleted from the ""By Traffic Channels"" field.



""By Brand/Offer source"" field is an independent field, so you can choose there any added Brand/Offer source regardless of the info selected in the ""By Traffic Channels"" or ""By Campaigns"" fields.

390,Traffic filtering,"
Traffic filtering: overview



Traffic filtering means blocking or redirecting your traffic based on the set criteria (geo, ISP, OS, etc.). This feature is useful for those working with more complex funnels where you may have different landing pages for different geolocations or different offers for mobile and desktop visitors. In RedTrack we have one of the best end-expensive proxy bases which distinguishes us from other similar services. Having the possibility to sort out the traffic by these criteria is very important for our clients as some offers may not be paid by the reason of so-called proxy-users as in many cases it is related to fraud. In order not to lose reputation, it is sometimes better to filter the traffic this way. 



Supported filters can be viewed and applied in Campaigns → chosen campaign settings → Funnels → Filters → Add filter. RedTrack can currently offer the following filter categories:




Countries



Regions



Cities



ISP



Browser



Browser version



OS



OS version



Device brand



Device model



IP



Subs



Languages



Referrer



Referrer domain



Device type



Connection types



Proxy types



Fraud check



Unique path (contact sales@redtrack.io to activate this filter)




Traffic filtering works only with redirect tracking, that’s why this functionality won’t be useful for Campaigns with such Traffic sources as Google Ads, Facebook, and others requiring no-redirect tracking. The reason for that is that the no-redirect method / universal script presupposes tracking via a script which means that the click is recorded when it's already on the page meanwhile filters work out before the click gets to the page.



How to apply filters



RedTrack allows you to create custom filters that can be added either as pre-set templates or directly on the Campaign level. To set it up act depending on the chosen method:





In your campaign settings go to Funnels → choose the needed one (if you have multiple funnels) → Filters → choose the filter from the Add filter drop-down → choose the Type and the Value for it (type and value define how the filter works out) → Save changes:









Most of the filters are self-explanatory. That being said, some of them are specific in a way: 



Filter's nameDetails about this filterProxy typeThis filter has the following types:Anonymous Proxy protects the user's personal information by hiding identifying information about the client's computer.Transparent Proxy does not hide identifying information about the client's computer (other than what is required for authentication and identification).Hosting Proxy displays the IP addresses of users on the internal network.SubsThe sub-value you want to put inside the filter should be the same as you have received from your source of traffic with the click. If several values under the same sub are to be used, simply put them in the same field separated by a comma:Unique pathThis filter will work only if you have the same IP and User agent, otherwise, it may fail to work out and lead traffic in different paths.





Include vs Exclude




Include type means that the page will be available for a certain group of people only. All the conditions should be met for the click to be sent to this funnel.




ExampleYour filters are:Filter by countries → Include → GermanyFilter by OS → Include → WindowsResult:Your funnel will be shown only for people from Germany with Windows OS, non-matching clicks will be redirected to another funnel or the default fallback URL (make sure you set it up). 




Exclude type means that your offer will be shown for everyone except those values in the filters. With excluding filters only one of the conditions can be met for the filter to be triggered.




ExampleIf you add Exclude filter for Germany, it means clicks from Germany will be redirected to another funnel in this campaign (if it is available) or to the default fallback URL (make sure you set it up). 



Contains vs No contains



Contains and No contains filter types are meant for partial matching. These types allow to apply filters to the hit-and-miss data.



ExampleIf your filter is Subs → Contains 1,2,3,4,5, but Subs data includes 1,2,3,4,5,6, the system will count all the incoming traffic with all its values (even the value 6, which wasn't defined in the Subs filter). 





The traffic is filtered on the RedTrack level only. Non-matching traffic will be sent to the 'forbidden' page or to the fallback URL (it is available).





1. Go to Tools → Filter presets → Create new preset → give it a name → choose the filter → add Type and Value (type and value define how the filter works out) → Save: 









Most of the filters are self-explanatory. That being said, some of them are specific in a way:

392,Fallback URL,"
Fallback URL&nbsp;is the backup URL, that is used when the traffic cannot reach the main page for some reason (filter, cap). Instead of showing the visitor the ugly “forbidden” screen, you can send those clicks to a backup offer or even a Google page.



To set it up:



1. Go to&nbsp;Tools→&nbsp;Fallback URL:







2.&nbsp;You can place any link you want to redirect the traffic from your Campaign as a Fallback URL. Also, you can use Sub ID parameters to send some important data if necessary. These parameters are to be used the same way as it is done on a campaign level:







We suggest you use some additional offer and add its link as a default fallback URL, it will help you not to lose your traffic.

396,Funnel auto-optimization (AI),"
What is an Auto-optimization feature and its specifics?



The auto-optimization feature allows you to set the rules for auto-optimizing your funnel based on the received conversions. When this option is switched on, RedTrack sets the higher weight for a better-converting offer. RedTrack.io AI analyses the funnel paths and sends clicks along with the ones that are highly likely to give the desired results based on accumulated data. An example of the path is the combination of landing and offer or placement (subid value) and conversion.



In other words, you can auto-optimize every X conversions based on the last Y conversions. It means that AI will recalculate how to distribute traffic every X conversions (for example, 10) and will do it based on the historical data of Y (for example, 100). The system will not start the auto-optimization until the number of conversions specified in Y is collected.



The auto-optimization feature is available starting from the Pro subscription.



How do I apply this feature?



To enable this feature in your account, act as follows:



1. Go to your Campaign settings→ Funnel section→ switch on the Auto optimize toggle→ set up the needed conditions:







Values explained:1,2,3 -switch on the toggle and set the needed number of conversions4 - choose certain conversion types for auto-optimization in this funnel (if needed)5. Goal - what to check, the metric towards which AI will optimize.6. Path is the element of the funnel that will contribute performance data towards goal measurement.☛ Example: CR optimization goal for lander-offer. So AI will analyze the CR for all lander-offer combinations and send most of the traffic to the higher CR,  some traffic to the next combination, and so on.7. Threshold - to become part of the auto-optimization, a particular path should get a threshold goal value or higher.☛ Example: we have a CR optimization goal for lander-offer. We set the threshold to 1%, which means that any combination of lander-offer that had less than 1% CR will be removed from optimized rotation and will receive some learning traffic (will be explained later). If you use optimization based on subid value. (e.g., placement or publisher) - you can set how many clicks a specific value should receive during the learning period to be included in optimization.8. Multiplier - defines the subjective bias of the best path value among all winning combinations.☛ How it works: AI will apply a system of traffic distribution that ensures that all winning combinations get some traffic based on their performance toward the selected goal. You can override this by sending even more traffic to the best path.  9. Apply to - defines how much traffic will be distributed based on performance results. The rest will be distributed randomly based on the funnel setting to feed AI with additional learning data.



As a result, all the paths with the traffic will participate in the optimization (weight will be distributed between them in order to determine where the traffic will go), and these paths will receive a maximum % of the traffic specified in “Apply to”, the rest will be distributed among the other path values that were not included in the optimization.



RedTrack will choose the best path to lead you to the best result. There can be various options (depending on what you choose, the number of paths can be thousands).



2. All the weight changes in the Funnel can be tracked in the Autooptimization report:







Example:The system will check the number of conversions and the conditions for the funnel:If you have 4 offers in the funnel and ask to check every 4 conversions based on the last 100, we will start the optimization once the target conversion number is reached (can be 10 for the first offer and 30 for the second, third, and fourth).We do the optimization based on a path, not a single element. So if a campaign has LP+Offer, then we will optimize this combination as a winning one.For example:Landing1-Offer1 - 30Landing1-Offer2 - 20Landing2-Offer3 - 10Landing1-Offer3 - 40Auto-optimization will start working only after there is enough data based on the rules set.



3. In case you put the wrong values or decided to go the other way, you can always restart the learning by pressing the Restart learning button. The system will start to grab the data for the correct optimization from the beginning:

399,Publishers: adding a domain,"To add a domain to your branded portal act as follows:

1. Domain is an essential thing to start working with your branded portal:

 	if you do not have a domain yet, you need to purchase one first with the help of any domain name registrar you know. Google the available registrars and choose the one suitable for you. In this guide, we will show how to add a CNAME and TXT on the example of the GoDaddy domain registrar. Once you've purchased a domain, proceed with step 2.
 	if you already have a purchased domain move on to step 2.

Important disclaimer!

The settings below are demonstrated on the example of the GoDaddy registrar. Your settings may differ depending on the registrar you bought your domain in.
2. You need to integrate your domain which is made the same way as a custom tracking domain - via creating a CNAME record, but in case of the branded portal domain settings, your CNAME record should point to pub.redtrack.io.

CNAME record should point to advert.redtrack.io in your domain registrar. CNAME setup varies depending on the registrar where you purchased the domain, follow this guide for details. 



2. Purchase the SSL certificate. It is an obligatory step. GoGetSSL is a good service for this purpose.

419,Parameters/UTMs: show on a page,"
Why?



You can use additional parameters on your lander to improve your page performance and make it more personal for a visitor. For example, show the city information based on the actual city of the visitor. RedTrack has a list of supported dynamic parameters available for that purpose. If you need to receive some additional information on your Landing page, you can add these macros to your lander's URL.



How?



1. Use the desired macro in your landing page URL, and we will identify it on the page. Let's use city as an example for this guide. Example: https://landingpage/?city={city}



The list of other supported parameters is here.



2. Put the script into your page code.



&lt;script type=""text/javascript"">
var parameterName;
function getParameterData(name) {
var query = window.location.search.substring(1);
var vars = query.split(""&amp;"");
for (var i=0;i&lt;vars.length;i++) {
var pair = vars&#91;i].split(""="");
if(pair&#91;0] === name){
return decodeURI(pair&#91;1]);}
}
""return"";
}

parameterName = getParameterData('city')
&lt;/script>



3. Put another script to your page where it is supposed to place the dynamic value from the URL:



&lt;script&gt;document.write(getParameterData('city'))&lt;/script&gt;



The ""city "" parameter was used as an example, instead, you can use any of the parameters available in RT. 



If you need to show several different parameters, add this line again:



&lt;script&gt;document.write(getParameterData('city'))&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;document.write(getParameterData('sub6'))&lt;/script&gt;



Since we use the parameter ""city "" here, the script will take the dynamic value for the city from the LP URL and place it on your page. 



Here's how it might look on a page:

URL syntax



Uniform Resource Locator (URL or web address)&nbsp;refers to a web resource that specifies its location on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it.



The general form of this syntax is as follows: &lt;protocol&gt;://&lt;hostname&gt;/&lt;pathname&gt;?&lt;query&gt;https://help.redtrack.io/knowledgebase/kb/automation/traffic-source-integration-status-2/?sub1=testvalue



Elements of this syntax explained:&lt;protocol&gt;&nbsp;Hypertext Transfer Protocol, which can be https (secured) or http (not secured)&lt;hostname&gt; An Internet host. RedTrack.io provided the service domain&nbsp;something.rdtk.io for that purpose. Usually, it is changed to a custom tracking domain for your tracking links. In our example above it is help.redtrack.io.&lt;pathname&gt; A resource location path. This is usually a full directory path.&nbsp;knowledgebase/kb/automation/traffic-source-integration-status-2/ in the example&lt;query&gt;&nbsp;An optional query or other information to be passed to the server when the resource is accessed.sub1=testvalue in the example



If there are several parameters, they need to be separated with the “&amp;” symbol: sub1=testvalue&amp;country={country}. The parameters are not obligatory for the link to work and can be skipped if its usage is not required.



The &lt;query> part should be obligatorily divided from the previous part of the URL with the “?” symbol - that means the main link part is ended, and additional parameters will be applied further.



RedTrack supported parameters/tokens



A dynamic parameter is something that is dynamically replaced with real value during the tracking process. A dynamic parameter is also known as a variable, token, macro, or variable.





These are the parameters you can use for your own purpose for a traffic channel, affiliate network, or a Lander the way you need it:



ParameterDescription{os}OS Macro{browser}Browser Macro{sourceid}TrafficSource ID{country}Country Macro{city}City Macro{lpkeyua}LP Key Macro{campaignid}CampaignID Macro{isp}ISP Macro{region}Region{ip}IP address{useragent}User agent{brand}Device brand{model}Device model{prelanderid}Prelander ID{prelandername}Prelander name{landerid}Lander ID{landername}Lander name{offerid}Offer ID{offername}Offer name{browserversion}Browser version{osversion}OS version{countryname}Full Country name{connectiontype}Connection type{referrerdomain}Referrer domain{clicktime}Time of the click recorded in UTC{timestamp}Unix timestamp of conversion creation. This parameter gets data from the Offer source/Network. If postback has this parameter, then conversion will be recorded in the time defined within this parameter.{campaignname}Campaign name{trafficsourcename}Traffic source name{postbackid}Conversion ID{domain}Passes domain to the lander

It works for the cases when you receive this conversion data in a postback with the help of sub-values.



Before using any impression-related parameters, make sure your traffic channel supports them.

Renaming/using UTMs



RedTrack offers you 20 additional parameters to pass the needed traffic channel data to RedTrack, from sub1 to sub20. These parameters are called subs (sub1, sub2, sub3, etc.) by default but you can easily rename these parameters as you need to match your tracking needs (e.g. utm_source, utm_campaign, utm_medium, adname, etc.). We call it aliases. 
To update the aliases for the target names, go to the Traffic channel → Additional parameters. If your parameter field is greyed and prevents you from renaming it, just remove the assigned role to this parameter → move over to the enabled parameter field and rename it as per your needs → assign the role back → save changes to the template:
 







Clickid



Clickid is the core element of tracking. It is generated both on the traffic source and on the RedTrack side. This is a unique click identifier that helps to send and receive the conversion data after the conversion happens.



It is important to pass the click identifier to RedTrack, make RedTrack generate it's own clickid and to pass it to the offer, CRM, shop, etc. In this regard, here is where you need to make sure the clickid is in place:





The clickid should be in place regardless of the tracking method (redirect or no-redirect).



For the preset templates, it will be added to your tracking link automatically upon creating a campaign. The name of RedTrack parameter which stores the click identifier from the traffic channel is {ref_id} (there are some exceptions such as Facebook).



At the same time, RedTrack also generates its own id for this click. Like that, each click can have 2 click identifiers: from RedTrack and from the traffic channel. 



The script plays the main role for no-redirect tracking: it generates the clickid and records it in the system. If there are any dynamic parameters, the script catches also, same as it does with the clickid.

1. If you want plan to receive the conversion data from your affiliate network, partner, CRM, etc. you need to put the postback URL (the one you can take from RedTrack) with the clickid parameter to your affiliate network. Each time the URL is fired,  we will get the conversion data for the right clickid and record it in RedTrack.



To make this URL work as expected, you need to add the {clickid} parameter:http://your.dedicated.tracking.domain.com/postback?clickid={affiliate_network_parameter}.Affiliate Network parameter is to be inserted with specific placeholders supported ({} or [], or ##, etc.). It should be the same as used in the Offer URL:offer_url?affiliate_network_parameter={clickid}



2. There can be scenarios where you do not work with any affiliate network or a partner via S2S. In that case, it is essential to have RedTrack clickid generated in place and pass it to the place/system where conversion happens to be able to use it later to tell RedTrack that this clickid has brought the conversion.





Partner parameters tracking



In addition to RedTrack parameters, there are also partner parameters that can be tracked, recorded and used for the data analysis. Check out how to work with them:





As a tracker, we record a lot of essential data: country, city, OS, browser, language, ISP, IP, etc. However, there are a lot of parameters we do not have (creative id, banner id, site name, etc.). Still, they are significant: if you see that some creative gives you most of your conversions, you can send all the traffic through it and switch off other creatives without wasting your time and money.



In RedTrack, we have a list of ‘empty’ parameters, which can be used to receive data from your traffic channel.



Where do you find them?



We have a lot of pre-set traffic source templates with pre-filed parameters. If your target traffic channel is not on the list, add it manually as a custom. Usually, the necessary parameters can be found in your traffic channel account postback settings (alongside the postback template). They may have different names, but the purpose remains the same: variables, tokens, macros, dynamic variables, dynamic parameters, etc.



Check for the account, postback, campaign, tools, or tracking settings in your traffic channel account. Target variables can be listed in a column or a row or even hidden under some text. You can always ask your Traffic Source Account Manager for help.



What can be done after?





1. Record



To receive the additional parameters from the traffic channel, you must add the parameters string to the tracking URL (=campaign URL for the redirect tracking) or to the parameters field (for example, to the tracking template for the no-redirect tracking).



2. Analyze



Open your campaign or traffic channel report and group the data based on sub ids received. You can choose any data slice for analysis: date+IP+sub3, device+browser+sub4, etc.:







Check out the reporting section for more information.





All the data you have received from your traffic channel can be provided to your affiliate network. The only bottleneck here is whether your affiliate network supports it or not.



Lots of networks have ‘empty’ parameters available for tracking (e.g., {utm_medium}, {affsub}, [affiliate_sub], etc.),&nbsp;but you still need to clarify the question with your Account Manager.



Assuming your network has some parameters you can use for that purpose here is an example of how to send the data received from the traffic source. Here are the parameters supported by your affiliate network:{utm_source}{aff_sub1}{aff_sub2}Here are the parameters supported by your Traffic Source and recorded in your RedTrack profile:That means these parameters were recorded under the corresponding subs: {zoneid} under sub1, {campaignid} under sub2, etc. Here is your Offer URL in RedTrack:Put the desired parameters to your Offer URL under the affiliate network parameters:In our case {campaignid} received from the Traffic Source will be recorded in your Affiliate Network account under {utm_source}, {device} under {aff_sub1}, {browser} under {aff_sub2}







Not all affiliate networks support receiving or sending additional parameters. Usually, there are several ‘empty’ parameters available for integrations (one of them should be used for passing the clickid value). These ’empty’ parameters do not contain any information themselves and are used only to receive  some data(click ids, campaign ids, source ids) and then send this info back where/if needed. However,&nbsp;some of the networks provide additional information through the dynamic parameters.



How do I set it up?



In general, this integration is established in 3 simple steps:



1. Add the click id parameter to the Offer URL. You will need to use both the network and RedTrack parameters.



…offer_url?affiliate_network_parameter={clickid}



Our click id data will be recorded under&nbsp;affiliate_network_parameter&nbsp;in your network account. This parameter can have various names, starting from clickid and ending with some abstract ones, such as aff_sub or utm_medium.



2. Add the click id parameter to the postback URL.



Again, you will need both the corresponding parameters from the network and RedTrack here. The only difference is in the macro order: since the postback URL sends clickid data recorded in the network back to RedTrack, the order will be opposite to the offer.



https://your.dedicated.tracking.domain.com/postback?clickid={affiliate_network_parameter}This parameter is inserted with the specific placeholders used by your network ({}, [], ##, etc.) and should be the same as used in the offer URL (offer_url?affiliate_network_parameter={clickid})



3. Add the postback URL to your Affiliate Network.



Just grab the URL with the replaced click id parameter (the one described in step 2) and paste it to your affiliate network postback settings. We recommend using it for a global postback if there is such an option.



What else can be done?



Some affiliate networks have dynamic parameters with data: {status}, {orderid}, etc.. You can use this data for your campaigns: to track them in RedTrack and send them to your traffic source campaign. To do that, you need to put these parameters to your affiliate network postback URL.



1. Go to Offer sources (your Network settings)→ Additional parameters→ put them into the available Parameter fields and the added subs will appear in the Postback URL field→ copy the generated Postback URL:







2. Put the copied Postback URL to your affiliate network postback (preferably under the global postback).

431,Rules &amp; Optimisation,"
What are Rules in RedTrack?



Rules functionality allows you to automate the campaign optimization process. After you set the conditions, RedTrack starts checking your reports and campaign performance by multiple metrics. When the reported data matches the criteria you have set in the conditions, the rule executes an action: pausing a campaign/one of the campaign elements or redistributing the traffic weight within your campaign.



Rules functionality is available starting from the Pro subscription.



Algorithm for rule creation:



1. Add such essential elements as Traffic channel, RT Campaign, and a certain Rule object (Campaign, Adset, Creative, etc.).



Availability of Rule objects depends on the Traffic channel. Go to this article to see the dependence between traffic channel and rule object.



2. Set a Condition (or several conditions) and Action&nbsp;which should happen to the Rule object within this rule once this condition (or multiple conditions if that's the case) is met.



By Action we mean the actual types of rules: Pause, Pause &amp; Restart, Scale, Schedule. The type of Action/rule you can choose depends on the Traffic channel. Go to this article to see which types of Action/rules are available for which Traffic channels.



3. Add the rest of the elements:




how you want to be notified when a certain action is fulfilled: email or webhook;



decide if you need to apply Multiple executions toggle;



set the frequency of Rule check;



add the Title.




How to create a Rule in RT?



1. On the main RedTrack menu go to Automated rules → New:







2. Fill in the fields in the pop-up window → press Save and Activate:










(1) Choose the needed traffic channel.




Mind that in order to be chosen this traffic channel needs to be added to your RedTrack account first, otherwise, you may not find the needed option in this drop-down.




(2) Choose the Campaigns where you want to apply this rule. You can work with this field in different ways:








Although it’s possible to set the rules for several campaigns using the same traffic channel, possibility of multiple campaigns is unavailable for Legacy subscription plans.



Options in the drop-down of the RedTrack campaigns field will appear only after you select the Traffic channel. These two fields absolutely depend on each other, as you can only see the campaigns where the selected traffic channel is present. Thus if you leave the Traffic channels field empty, you'll have no options in the drop-down of the RedTrack campaigns field. Selecting one Traffic channel and trying to find in the drop-down of the RedTrack campaigns field campaigns with another Traffic channel is impossible:→ correct example: you choose Facebook in the Traffic channels drop-down → you find all the campaigns with Facebook traffic source in ""Redtrack campaigns"" drop-down.→ incorrect example: you choose Google Ads in the Traffic channels drop-down → you want to find some campaign with Facebook traffic source in the Redtrack campaigns drop-down → your can't, as you can only see campaigns with the previously chosen Facebook traffic source in the Traffic channels field.




(3) Choose the targeted value for the rule application.





(4) Set up the condition according to which this rule will function.





(5) Press +Add condition if you want to add more than 1 condition. You can add up to 5 conditions simultaneously.




- All the added conditions will work at the same time. To set up conditions that exclude each other please create a new rule.- Rules with multiple conditions will be triggered only if all conditions are met. If one condition is met and the other is not, the rule will not work.- Multiple conditions are available for Trial, Advanced, Team, Enterprise, Grow, Scale, Prevail, and Custom subscriptions, as well as for all clients with automation + /++/+++ regardless of their subscriptions.




(6) Choose what needs to be done when the rule is applied:








The type of the rule (Pause, Pause&amp;Restart etc.) depends on the chosen traffic channel. Please check out this article to see if your traffic channel is eligible for the needed type of rule.




(7)&nbsp;Choose how you want to be notified about the processed rule: by email or via webhook.




You can add multiple webhooks (up to 10). Nevertheless, this possibility is not available for Legacy plans.




(8)&nbsp;Specify the e-mails where the notification should come to.




As a rule, this field allows containing more than 1 email. Nevertheless, possibility of multiple emails is not available for users on the following subscription plans: Trial, Legacy.




(9) You should turn on the Multiple executions toggle in case you want to allow multiple blocking and notifications for each Rule object. It works as follows:






Once the condition(s) is met and the rule has worked, this same rule will work again once the set condition is met. This will happen as many times as needed up until the client decides to either pause the rule or delete it.





Once the condition(s) is met and the rule has worked, this rule will no longer work. Meaning, it's useless even if the set condition is met again and may as well be deleted.





Example:It means that when CR is less than 20 for every 100 clicks, Facebook Campaign will be paused and you will be notified about it via email ilonmusk@redtrack.io. Since the “Multiple executions” toggle is switched on, this rule will work as many times as needed before you decide to either pause or delete it. Every 30 minutes the system will check if the condition is met and the rule will work again if it’s met.




(10) Choose from the drop-down the Frequency of the rule check.





(11) Give your rule the name to distinguish it from others.





(12) Press Save and activate to apply the rule.




Case study.Your rule settings are as follows:What it means:If the ROI for your campaign is less than 100% for every 100$ of your ad spend, RedTrack can pause that campaign or send you an email notification to the address you've set (in the example it's ilona@redtrack.io).





3. As a result of the applied rules you will get the following:



&nbsp; &nbsp;✓ When the data matches the criteria you set, the campaign/placement/creative will be paused in your traffic source account&nbsp;and you will not lose the money for non-converting traffic.&nbsp; &nbsp;✓ Every five minutes the rules will analyze the data.&nbsp; &nbsp;✓ Extended integrations also take your&nbsp;cost data&nbsp;from your traffic source account so you do not need to worry about cost updates as well.



For non-integrated sources (either a regular template or custom traffic channel) only partial campaign optimization is available. RedTrack will not be able to pause anything on the traffic source side but you can still set the rule and when the rule is met, the system will either fire the mail or webhook notification.



Working with Rules: edit, pause, logs



Once the rule is created, you can:





To filter rule(s) by certain campaigns go to Automated rules →  choose the campaign from the drop-down → Apply:









To edit/pause/check out the logs for certain rule navigate with your mouse to the corresponding icon next to the needed rule:







Once the rule is applied and the Campaign has been paused only you can make the Campaign active again by pressing the Start rule icon next to the rule:





In the column Action you can also see which type of action (notification, pause, pause&amp;restart, etc.) was applied to each created rule:

433,Cost/Ad spend: automatic update,"
What's an ""Auto update cost"" feature?



Auto update costs feature allows you to receive your cost data directly from the traffic channel via the API. It means there is no need to use any macros or update costs manually each time. Enabling this feature can help you with the following:




Costs are updated not in real-time but several times a day with a frequency from 5 up to 60 minutes on the Campaign,&nbsp;Adset, and&nbsp;Ad levels. Update of frequency and level depends on your subscription plan.



Auto update costs feature presupposes smart automation, so if you have multiple campaigns in your Google or Facebook account,&nbsp; you don't have to create the same amount of campaigns in RedTrack as our smart automation can attach your traffic channel campaigns costs to 1 RedTrack campaign.



No additional settings are required. All you need to do is integrate your traffic channel → choose the needed cost update depth and frequency → enable the auto update costs toggle in the campaign with your traffic channel. Once it's done RT will take your campaign IDs from the traffic channel and attach the cost data accordingly.




 In order to avoid data discrepancy every day at UTC+14:00 RedTrack renews (recirculates) costs data for the previous day for such channels as Google, Facebook, Bing, and Outbrain.



Since the auto update cost feature it API bound, make sure you channel is integrated with RedTrack via API and is eligible for it. Go to this article → part API-based Cost updates. If your traffic channel is not in the list it means that this feature is not available for you, please contact support@redtrack.io for further guidance.



How to enable the ""Auto update cost"" feature



In order to set up the auto update cost feature act as follows: 



1. In the added traffic channel template choose the needed levels of Cost update depth and Cost update frequency → Save changes to the template:









If your traffic channel is eligible for all 3 levels: Campaign, Adset, and Ad, but there is a lock next to it, it means that this level of cost update depth is not included in your subscription plan:To get this level, please contact support@redtrack.io.









The default value for Cost update frequency is 30 minutes. In order to change it to 15 or 5 minutes please contact support@redtrack.io. 





2. Once you've created a campaign with this traffic channel in the campaign settings turn on the toggle Auto update costs → Save changes to the campaign:







Click here for the guidance on campaign creation in RT. 



Auto update costs feature works well for Campaigns with CPM or CPC cost models. Using this feature with CPA or RevShare cost models will cause data discrepancies.

435,Pause placement,"
What's a pause placement feature?



Since RedTrack is integrated with a set of traffic channels via API, we are able to pause different elements on the traffic channel side. That includes the possibility to pause not only the entire campaign but ad placements in your traffic channel account. Like that you will not spend more money on non-converting creatives, placements or even campaigns. This can be implemented via the Automated rules functionality.



To find out if your traffic channel is eligible for this type of rule go to this article (Rules → Pause → Channel placement).



How do I set up the channel placement rule?



1. Go to Automated rules → New → choose the targeted Traffic channel, Campaign(s) and select Channel placement from the Rule object drop-down:







2. Set up the Conditions for the rule to be triggered and the Actions to be performed when it happens → fill in the rest of the mandatory fields → Save and Activate: 







Every five minutes the rules analyse the reported data. When the reported data matches criteria set in conditions, this placement is paused in your traffic channel account.

3. Set up the tracking on the RTX Platform side.



3.1 Log into your RTX Platform account. For a Pops or Push campaign on RTX Platform, you will have the “Pixels &amp; Tracking” section at the bottom of the Campaign Settings page:







If you already have a pixel created for the conversion event type this campaign (i.e., Form Submit, Lead, Purchase, Pageview, etc.), you can select it from the drop-down menu next to “Pixel Assignment”.




If you see it with a green checkmark, the pixel has already fired a conversion to RTX Platform before. 



If it is yellow, the pixel has never fired a conversion before.



If you do not have a pixel yet, you will need to create one with the following steps: 




Select the Create New Pixel in a “Pixel Assignment” drop-down&nbsp; menu:







3.2 Give your Pixel a name and choose the action type you want to track (Form Submit, Lead, Purchase, Sign-Up, Pageview, or Other):







3.3 Choose the ""Server to Server"" option for a pixel type → copy the pixel link:











In our case the link looks as follows:https://cn.rtclx.com/conv/?v=ZTZmNDJkNzc5NzI1MmI0ZWE2MjVmMTJkYjNhOTI2MzA6Mjg4MTM%3D&amp;p=3696&amp;r=&amp;b=&lt;click_id>To make it work with RedTrack, replace the last token with {ref_id}, so the final URL looks like this:https://cn.rtclx.com/conv/?v=ZTZmNDJkNzc5NzI1MmI0ZWE2MjVmMTJkYjNhOTI2MzA6Mjg4MTM%3D&amp;p=3696&amp;r=&amp;b={ref_id}NOTE!RTX Platform provides separate Postback links for each Campaign, so you will need to copy a unique URL for each new Campaign you create in RTX Platform following this instruction.



4. Set up the postback URL in RedTrack.



Go to Campaign settings (created within step 2) → scroll down to&nbsp;S2S Postback for RTX Platform → Add → check if all the needed values for the REPLACE&nbsp;parameters are in place → Save changes to the campaign:











Important!▸ If you changed the Postback URL in the Traffic channel (added/removed some parameters to it), remember to manually update the link in Campaign settings as well, as it won’t be generated correctly automatically.▸ Some Traffic channels require you to edit the Postback with specific parameters for each Campaign (e.g., the goal for Exoclick or ap_key for Go2Mobi). If the field remains blank or something like “REPLACE” is stated, that means you need to define the Postback conditions manually.



5. Launch a campaign at RTX Platform.



When creating your campaign in the RTX Platform account during the Create your Creative step insert the Click URL (copied in step 2) into the URL field:

611,Google Ads and RedTrack,"








Google Ads&nbsp;is an online advertising solution that businesses use to promote their products and services on Google Search, YouTube, and other sites across the web. Google Ads also allows advertisers to choose specific goals for their ads, like driving phone calls or website visits. With a Google Ads account, advertisers can customize their budgets and targeting, and start or stop their ads at any time.



RedTrack has an API integration with Google Ads which allows you to:




Send conversion data back to Google and attribute it to your customised conversion type



Synchronize costs



Pause: campaign, placement, creative



Create automated rules







Google Ads supports both no-redirect and parallel tracking.  We do not recommend using parallel tracking unless you are 100% sure you are allowed to do that and have approval from Google. The no-redirect tracking method works without any issues. Click on the corresponding Google Ads Help article for more details on the technical possibility of applying parallel tracking in Google Ads.



Custom tracking domain usage is obligatory with Google.






Integration





Before you proceed with the integration, make sure to have already added:




Custom tracking domain



Offer &amp; Offer source&nbsp;(if you are an affiliate) /&nbsp;Brand &amp; Website&nbsp;(if you are an advertiser).



Google Ads account Customer ID






1. Add Google Ads as a&nbsp;Traffic channel&nbsp;in RedTrack. 



Traffic channels →&nbsp;New from template&nbsp;→ Google Ads (no-redirect tracking) →&nbsp;Add → Save the template:











 Saving Google Ads template first is essential for successful integration between Google Ads and RedTrack.



In the added template you can modify some Google parameters, although blocked (greyed) parameters should remain under the same sub-values with the same roles assigned as provided in the initial template. The following are essential for the API cost integration:{creative} should always be with Aid role{adgroupid} should always be with Gid role{campaignid} should always be with Cid role



In case of IOS trafficking due to Apple’s iOS14.5 changes if the click occurs from an iOS device and the user has opted out of tracking, RedTrack can get WBRAID and GBRAID parameters:WBRAID is used for web-to-app measurement.GBRAID is used for app-to-app measurement. The new parameters work in tandem with the modeled online conversion that does not attribute conversions to an individual user but rather offers a holistic report on conversions in compliance with user privacy. These parameters use aggregation and de-identification techniques that ensure cross-site behavior cannot be tied back to an individual user. If you do conversions in-app, you need to remove the {wbraid} parameter from the Google Ads Traffic channel template in RT.



A one-per-click counting setting may block the creation of conversions with such parameters as GBRAID/WBRAID in which case an error when sending such conversions will pop up. To resolve this issue you need to change the one-per-click setting in your Google Ads account:Check out this article for more details on changing the one-per-click setting in Google Ads.



Refer to this guide for the Campaign Manager 360 integration. 



2. Integrate&nbsp;Google Ads with RedTrack. 



Connecting your account first is important for both sending the conversion data to Google and getting costs.



2.1 Since it is a complex API integration, we need to get permission for integration from Google first, to do that press Sign in with Google:







2.2 Once your account is verified and you give RedTrack all the required permissions, you will be redirected back to the RT Google Ads template automatically. Add the Google Ads Customer ID and (if needed) Google MCC Account ID → Save changes to the template:







This is how you find your Google Ads Account ID.This is how you find your MCC Account ID.Add MCC account ID ONLY if you want to send conversions to it instead of the ad account. Combinations for account usage:1. Ads Account ID is filled in + MCC Account ID is empty:- Costs are received from Ads Account ID- Conversions are sent to Ads Account ID2. Ads Account ID is filled in + MCC Account ID is filled in:- Costs are received from Ads Account ID- Conversions sent to MCC Account ID



The account you’re connecting to must be the same as the one where you run your Google Ads Campaigns. The integration will not work if you connect the Google Ads manager account while running campaigns from sub-accounts. The indicator for successful integration is the enabled Active toggle:



The Auto Cost Update Depth and Frequency by default is set to the deepest possible according to your subscription. For Google PerformanceMax (PMax) campaigns, costs can be updated only on the Campaign level, as such campaigns send out only their Campaign IDs. That's why the only working Auto Cost Depth for your Traffic Channel in such cases is Campaign.



3. Add conversion events you want to use.



4. Map the conversion events.



Go to the settings of the added Google Ads Traffic channel →&nbsp;Google API integration → set up the mapping:




Conversion type is the custom conversion type from RedTrack.



Conversion name is how this conversion type will be displayed in your Google account.



Category&nbsp;is Google conversion event category. You no longer need to set the category manually in Google Ads, we will send the category with the conversion.



Include in “conversions”&nbsp;– set yes to add this conversion to the conversions column in the Google Ads.








▸ RT sends conversion to Google immediately, and if the upload is unsuccessful retries every 4 hours within the next 36 hours. The statistics for conversions passed from RedTrack will appear in your Google Ads account within approximately 24 hours, due to the architecture of Google. ▸ Conversion data is taken with the UTC zone.▸ It takes about 48 hours for Google to process IOS conversions without the clickid and make them appear in the Google Ads dashboard. However, there is a chance that Google will not attribute 100% of postbacks due to its logic or additional user settings.



5. Create the campaign in RedTrack with Google Ads as your traffic channel.





1. Use this guide to help you add the campaign. Once the campaign is created, all the tracking links and the parameters for the script will be generated automatically and include all the supported macros. 



2. For Google tracking you will need to use the tracking script in most of the cases. Follow this guide to choose the one that suits your needs better and set it up. 



You will have to use our script directly on the page code. 



The tracking parameters are to be added to a Google campaign. You will need to use the ""universal script"" OR ""no-redirect"" tracking parameters later depending on the type of script you have chosen before. Copy and save them:







3. Enable Auto-update costs toggle to receive costs automatically:

1. Go to the list of your campaigns → choose the target campaign →&nbsp;Settings&nbsp;→&nbsp;Account settings&nbsp;→&nbsp;Tracking:











2. Add the tracking parameters you have copied within the campaign creation to the corresponding field depending on your Campaign integration type:





If you are working with Google Merchant Center (Performance Max campaign) add the parameters to the&nbsp;Final URL suffix, but remove the&nbsp;{lpurl}?&nbsp;in the beginning. Remember to add the name of your campaign instead of the&nbsp;{replace}&nbsp;parameter in the middle of the tracking URL:









Insert the tracking parameters into the&nbsp;Tracking template&nbsp;field:









Tracking parameters for YouTube are added on the Ad level only.

615,Facebook and RedTrack,"










What's Facebook/Instagram?



Both Facebook and Instagram have the same ad managing interface (Facebook Ads Manager), so this article describes the flow for both platforms. 



Redirect URLs are normally forbidden on Facebook.There are limited cases when Facebook allows you to use the redirect link (e.g. RedTrack campaign tracking URL) but we as a service provider do not recommend it and cannot guarantee safety. 



For all of your Facebook campaigns, no-redirect tracking with a custom tracking domain should be used. Traffic filtering functionality is limited for Facebook and can be used for the Offer level only (for the cases when you run the traffic to the landing page first). For more details go to the Traffic filtering guide. 



Facebook integration allows you to:




pass all the conversion data back to Facebook (even the extra conversions), attach it to the campaigns (not only to the events manager), and help Facebook to optimize your traffic for even better traffic matching;



pause non-converting creatives and campaigns directly on the Facebook side, no manual work;



auto update your cost data.




Due to Facebook restrictions, conversion data can be delivered to your Facebook campaigns within 24 hours.



Integration checklist





Before you proceed with the other steps of the checklist, make sure to have the already added:



1. Custom tracking domain.



2. Offer (if you're an Affiliate) / Website (if you're an Advertiser).





Add a Facebook template and integrate it with RedTrack.



1. Traffic Channels → New from template → find Facebook → Add → Save:











You can modify some Facebook parameters in the opened template. Blocked (greyed) parameters should be used under the same sub-values with the same roles assigned as provided in the initial template. The following parameters and their roles are essential for the API cost integration:{{ad.id}} should always be with Aid role{{adset.id}} should always be with Gid role{{campaign.id}} should always be with Cid role



""fbclid"" parameter is required for sending the conversion data back to Facebook. This parameter should always be the last in the line, meaning, that there should be no other parameters after it in your RedTrack settings and later when you will add the parameters string to Facebook.



2. Since it is a complex API integration, we need to get permission to integrate from Facebook first. In the added template press Connect Facebook → verify your ad account:







Once you are redirected to your RedTrack account settings and see the Connected button, it means Facebook accepted the integration:



It is highly recommended to reconnect your Facebook account with RedTrack every 2-3 months for the integration to be valid, since Facebook can disconnect your account randomly for security reasons (you will notice that almost immediately since the cost data stops coming at that point).







1. Create a campaign in RedTrack using this guide. Once the campaign is created, all the tracking links and the parameters for the script will be generated automatically and include all the supported macros.



2. For Facebook tracking you will need to use the tracking script. Follow this guide to choose the one that suits your needs better and set it up.



Since Facebook does not like redirect tracking, you will have to use our script on the page code. 



You will need to add the tracking parameters later on the Facebook side. The parameters depend on the type of script you have chosen before and can be  taken from the ""universal script"" or ""no-redirect"" tab within campaign settings:







It is preferable to place the tracking script at the end of the body section of the landing page script.





1. Create a campaign in RedTrack using this guide. Once the campaign is created, all the tracking links and the parameters for the script will be generated automatically and include all the supported macros.



2. For Facebook you will need to use our universal tracking script. The universal tracking script is created automatically once you've added the Website and can be taken from your RT account → Scripts. The script should be placed on the page code or for your e-commerce store (check out the precise e-com guide for details).



The tracking parameters are to be copied from the campaign settings and saved for later:











Use this guide to help you add the events you plan to use to RedTrack. It will automatically send your conversion types to Facebook exactly as you name them.



- Conversion information will fall under your pixel/data source.- We recommend keeping a Purchase name for one of your conversions so that you do not need to make any adjustments on the Facebook side since Facebook knows this name very well and will optimize the traffic better for a Purchase than a custom name (Sale, Conversion, etc.).



If you are using non-standard names for the events you send to Facebook (something apart from Purchase, ViewContent, InitiateCheckout, Lead), you need to set them up on Facebook, too:



1.&nbsp;Events Manager →&nbsp;Custom conversions → Create custom conversion:











2.&nbsp;Fill in the fields in the pop-up window:








Name: give your custom conversion a&nbsp;name



(optional) Description: add a&nbsp;description&nbsp;to distinguish your custom conversion from others in the list



Data source: select the&nbsp;data source



Action source: select the&nbsp;action source&nbsp;to which your custom conversions are attributed (it should match with the one you will set inside RedTrack)



Event: select the event URL




If you select All URL traffic or a custom event, you’ll see the option to Choose a standard event for optimization. Facebook recommends you to keep the category they chose for you. If you want to choose a different category, select the one that best describes the conversion event you’re optimizing. Refer to this article for learning more about standard event categories in Facebook.




Rules:&nbsp;set the rules by URL&nbsp;or&nbsp;event parameters. You can select the parameters that you currently send with the event you selected. If you don’t see the parameter you want to choose, update your pixel or Conversions API setup to send the parameter with your event.




▸ Parameters that follow the OR condition. For example, if you create a custom conversion using a purchase event and type in Product A, Product B and Product C in the content_id parameter value, the custom conversion measures when someone purchases product A, B or C.▸ Rules that follow the AND condition. For example, if you create 3 separate rules for content_id equals A, content_id equals B, and content_id equals C, the custom conversion measures when all 3 events occur.Refer to this article for more info about Rules within this setup.




(optional) Enter a conversion value:&nbsp;click to check the box next to&nbsp;Enter a conversion value, then enter your value. Only use this field if the events in your custom conversion don’t have a conversion value.




Use only whole numbers, and don’t include any additional symbols.

3.&nbsp;Once you’ve created your custom conversion, to activate it, navigate to the page of your website it’s referencing to trigger it. Then get back to&nbsp;the Events Manager →&nbsp;Custom conversions&nbsp;tab and see if the added conversion changed its status to&nbsp;Active:









Your Facebook account → Events Manager→ pixel settings → Settings → Create Access Token:







Here is more about Conversion API Key in FB.





Due to the new Facebook policy, you should now verify the domain you will be using for your Facebook campaign. This is an action that should be done on your Facebook account.



Domains on Facebook can be verified in 3 ways:- via meta tag- via the uploaded HTML file- via DNS recordFor details on the domain verification procedure on Facebook, check out the following guides:- Domain verification in Meta Business Manager- Methods of domain verification on FacebookThe steps below will demonstrate the DNS record management method. 



1. Business Manager → Brand Safety and Suitability → Domains → Add → Create a new domain:







2. Paste your domain → Add:







Use the root domain without any prefixes. Correct: website.com.Incorrect: www.website.com or https://website.com.



Domains will not appear in your list immediately. Give the system some time to replicate the data.



3. Select the target domain → choose the DNS verification method:







4.&nbsp; Copy your unique TXT value:  







5. Go to your domain registrar → open DNS settings and add a new record with the following values:




Host: @



Points to: your unique TXT record from point 4



TTL: the lowest possible




The steps you need to perform to add a DNS TXT record to your DNS settings may vary depending on the domain host. The screenshots in this article are examples from GoDaddy.



6. Give it some time for the data replication to happen (approximately 1 hour), then verify the domain in your Facebook domain settings:







Once the domain is verified, you'll see a Verified tag next to the added domain:



7. Associate the domain with your page:











8. Get back to RedTrack → settings of the added Offer (for Affiliates)/ Website (for Advertisers) → CAPI (Maximize signals) → add the values for Default Action source and Default Event URL → Save changes to the template:




In the Default Action source select from the drop-down the type of the conversion to be set for Facebook API.



In the Default Event URL add the verified domain. The domain should be secure, use the following link format: https://your.domain.com.








If you don't add the the values for Default Action source and Default Event URL in RedTrack, conversions will fail to attribute.





You can find your unique pixel ID in the Facebook campaign settings → Tracking:









There are 2 ways of adding your FB pixel to RedTrack:





 Go to the settings of the added Offer/Website → CAPI (Maximize signals) → Add your Meta (FB) pixels to send the conversions with the Meta (FB) conversion API → add the the pixel, token and other needed values → Save  changes to the template:







Together with the Pixel ID add the Conversion API key for that pixel.




Action source: we recommend using the Website option



Event URL: the domain verified for Facebook. Use the ""https://domain.name"" URL structure.




Set the default values for the action source and event URL to let the system use them for all your pixels.



Check out this video explanation of how RT Conversion API works for META (Facebook). 





Go to the settings of the added Facebook traffic channel → Facebook default data source (pixel) → add the the pixel, token and Default conversion name (if needed) → Save changes to the template:







Default Event name field hint:- If the field remains empty, the default conversion is sent with the event under the name Purchase.- If the field is filled in, the default conversion is sent with the name specified in that field.







Ads Manager&nbsp;→ Create Ad → create a new campaign or use an existing campaign → set up campaign parameters → copy paste your LP&nbsp;URL/Website URL (the link without tracking parameters) under the website URL → add additional tracking parameters (universal script or tracking parameters (UTMs)) in the ""URL parameters"" section



Make sure there are no special symbols and spaces (#, %, etc.) in the names of your ads, adsets, and campaigns - otherwise the data won't be tracked. 



- Facebook catches only the initial data for ads, adsets, and campaign names (even when some test name was added as a draft), it will ignore all name updates you make after. - If you need to be sure you receive the correct  names, add them to the tracking parameters manually or analyze the data by IDs instead:cmpid=5f92a30bc860ee0001fa9996&amp;sub1={{ad.id}}&amp;sub2={{adset.id}}&amp;sub3={{campaign.id}}&amp;sub4=myad&amp;sub5=myadset&amp;sub6=mycampaign&amp;sub7={{placement}}&amp;sub8={{site_source_name}}- If there are already some UTM parameters in the URL parameters field, you do not have to delete them, just append the parameters taken from your campaign in RedTrack to the already existing parameters with the help of the ampersand symbol: ""&amp;"". Use this tutorial to help you add your LP URL and tracking parameters properly in Facebook Ads Manager.





This is an optional step. Warm up your account only if it is fresh and has no data / have a completely new empty account on Facebook.



Facebook will not accept your event until it considers this is a real event that can be used for optimization on its side.To start running a live campaign, you need to make sure everything is up and running. And at this point, we will need to warm up your account with some fake conversions.



1. Once you're done with the integration and have created a Facebook campaign, you need to run some live clicks from Facebook. 



We will need them for conversion generation. To find your clicks, go to Logs → Clicks:







2. Tools → Conversion tracking → copy the link from the S2S conversion tracking field:







3. Put the clickid from step 1 instead of the replace_me part in the postback URL you copied within step 2. 



Your link should look approximately like this: https://docs.trk.agency/postback?clickid=63e3788ca66ef500014a41ct



4. Paste the link to the browser and press enter. You should get this successful message:







5. The conversion will appear in your RedTrack account. Do the same with different click ids within a day. You will need approximately 20 conversions to warm up the account.



Don't generate fake conversions simultaneously, as Facebook may not accept them.Facebook needs a bit more time to attribute the conversions to your campaigns. It can take 48 to 72 hours to see the data.





Set up the automation.




Use&nbsp;this guide&nbsp;to help set up&nbsp;rules.



Use&nbsp;this guide&nbsp;for setting up the&nbsp;auto update cost&nbsp;feature.




Our tool also offers you the opportunity to manually switch on/off your Facebook Campaigns, Ad sets, or Ads without leaving RedTrack UI. Please check out a brief overview of the manual campaign management feature and contact sales@redtrack.io if you are interested.





If you work with an affiliate offer, having a 10/10 match quality is impossible. There is a&nbsp;list of parameters&nbsp;Facebook wants to receive, but only half of them can be covered by any third-party tool. This causes the match quality to be at a low level. And it’s not something you should struggle with.



However, RedTrack has a feature that can help you to improve the event match quality with Facebook. It does not take any additional values from Facebook, but if you have them on your website/affiliate network side (for example, order ID at Shopify) or store them on your side, you can send them to RedTrack and then to Facebook to increase the event match quality.



Make sure the website (affiliate network) can send additional target parameters. You can clarify this question with your account manager if it is an affiliate network you work with.For the cases where you do not work with any offer source and promote your offers, this feature can be used only if you store the data on your side and have the technical capabilities to add this data to the conversion triggered.



1. Make RedTrack identify and accept this data with a postback first



Offer sources / Brands → Additional parameters → add the required parameters, macro, name and assign the roles → Save changes to the template:







Data MUST be added to such columns as:◉ Macro/Token where you have to insert {r} or {replace}.◉ Role where you assign your parameters a certain role. The list of supported roles can be viewed in the dropdown:Data in the following columns is OPTIONAL but useful:◉ Parameter: that’s where you give your parameter a name, but can leave it empty and in the tracking URL your parameters will be called sub1,2,3 etc.◉ Name / Description: that’s the name you’ll see in the reports instead of sub1,2,3. For your convenience you can customize these names as you wish.



2. The added parameters will be appended to the Postback URL which you should copy:







3. Paste it to your offer source S2S postback settings as usual (or in any other postback option you use on your side).



Once the conversion postback containing those values is sent to RedTrack, we will grab it → attribute it to the appropriate campaign → send it to Facebook with the specified role. 





Troubleshoot





Account disconnected



Sometimes, Facebook can disconnect your account randomly for security reasons (you will notice that almost immediately since the cost data stops coming at that point). All you need to do in that case is to reconnect. 



Missing Purchase Currency and Value Parameters



“One or more of your Purchase events is missing a value and currency parameter. This may affect your return on ad spend calculation.”



If you have the value optimization on, some conversions still do not get the value. We always send the currency and value by default. This issue can be observed with test conversions. So it’s essential to send all values during the test.



Purchase Event Missing Deduplication Parameter



Most probably, you are using Conversion API and pixel at the same time (for example, send the same data from RedTrack and your website or use RedTrack CAPI and some other system CAPI).&nbsp; In this case, you might see both server and pixel type under the event in your Facebook account.Use only the RedTrack Conversion API to solve the issue.



Another reason can be a duplicate from a pixel or Conversion API without any unique event value, Facebook can recognize. What can be done? Check out&nbsp;this guide.



Conversion attribution issues



Conversion attribution may differ due to the FB algorithms (for example, they can be sent to different adsets if Facebook considers attributing some particular conversion to another adset)



Facebook has a 7-day attribution window. If there are less than 7 days between click and conversion, Facebook will attribute it. If the conversion is older than seven days, FB can exclude it from your statistics.



You cannot do anything with the conversion attribution.



Purchase Events May Be Dropped Due to Missing Event Source URL Parameter



Make sure you have followed the&nbsp;Facebook integration guide, verified your domain, and added it to your RedTrack offer settings.







Here is what you need to check on your side:



1. The traffic channel should be connected from the Facebook template. No error is shown; If it is not connected or you are not sure, re-connect it.



2. The correct account is connected.



3. The dynamic parameters such as campaign id, adset id and ad id are received by RedTrack (Logs → Clicks → check sub values).If there are no parameters in click logs, that means we are not receiving them from Facebook. Either these are your test clicks, or you need to check the Facebook campaign settings to have the parameters string in place.



4. The correct roles are assigned to the dynamic parameters;For the cost update to work properly, the following roles should be obligatory assigned to the Facebook ids in your traffic channel settings:







5. Check the cost model you use in the campaign settings (should be CPC) and if the Auto-update cost toggle is on inside the campaign settings.



If, after checking/doing all the suggested actions, you still experience the problem with the costs not coming, contact the support team.





What you can check to understand why the cost data is incomplete (higher or lower than the one you have on Facebook):



1. The first thing you need to compare is the IDs. RedTrack takes the cost data per ID (campaign, adset or ad, depending on your subscription level), so if some of the ID is missing, its cost data will not be taken to your RedTrack report. 



Check if all IDs are received in RedTrack (campaign report → group by (target ID used for the cost update) → check the list). If not, check this campaign, adset or ad in Facebook and ensure the dynamic parameters are added to pass the ID.



2. Check if the correct roles are assigned to the Facebook IDs in RedTrack. This can be checked in your traffic channel settings:







3. Check if the time zones match in your RedTrack account setting and in Facebook. 



The timezone of the cost data received via the API can be checked in your cost logs. If the timezones of your traffic channel and RedTrack don't match or the timezone within your ad accounts in the traffic channel do not match (for the cases when you run traffic from different ad accounts to one RedTrack campaign), the cost data matching is impossible.







4. Check the cost logs in RedTrack: if costs stopped coming for some time and caused this discrepancy, you might need to reconnect Facebook.



5. Make sure the currency matches in both systems.



If, after checking/doing all the suggested actions, you still experience the problem with the costs not coming, contact the support team.







Sometimes, you might need to check if there are events coming to Facebook and how they come to understand if anything goes wrong.

617,Snapchat and RedTrack,"




Snapchat&nbsp;is an American multimedia instant messaging app and service.



Integration





Before you proceed with the integration, make sure to have the already added&nbsp;custom tracking domain.





1. Add Snapchat as a Traffic channel in RedTrack.



Traffic channels → New from template → find Snapchat and Add it → Save the template:











In the Additional parameters section of the Snapchat template you can modify some parameters. Blocked (greyed) parameters should be used under the same sub-values with the same roles assigned as provided in the initial template.The following are essential for the API cost integration:{{ad.id}} should always be with Aid role{{adset.id}} should always be with Gid role{{campaign.id}} should always be with Cid roleIn the Additional parameters section of the Snapchat template you can modify some parameters. Blocked (greyed) parameters should be used under the same sub-values with the same roles assigned as provided in the initial template.The following are essential for the API cost integration:{{ad.id}} should always be with Aid role{{adset.id}} should always be with Gid role{{campaign.id}} should always be with Cid role



Without saving the template first, the system won’t be ready for integration, so the cost and conversion data can be lost.



2. Integrate your Snapchat account with RedTrack to receive costs.



In the added Snapchat template navigate to SnapChat API integration → click on Connect Snapchat → Continue:











Green Connected icon means the your integration has been successful:



3. Add conversion types to RedTrack.



Tools → Conversion tracking → Conversion types → use&nbsp;this guide&nbsp;to help you add the events.



4. Add pixel, access token, and match the conversion events.



RedTrack provides you with an opportunity to add Snapchat pixel(s) on the traffic channel level or on the offer/website level. Before you proceed with pixel adjustment consider the following:☝If you configure the Snapchat CAPI in the traffic channel template, RedTrack will only send conversions from Snapchat to Snapchat.☝If you configure the Snapchat CAPI in the offer/website template, RedTrack will send to Snapchat all conversions received on that offer/website from different traffic channels, not just Snapchat only. Plus in your offer/website template you can add multiple pixels.



Do not configure the Snapchat CAPI in both templates - traffic channel and offer/website, or you'll receive duplicated conversions!



Choose the preferred method and act accordingly:





1. Go to your Snapchat account and copy the values for Pixel ID and Access Token:




To get your Pixel ID go to Assets → Pixels:













To get your Access Token go to Business Settings → Business details → Conversions API token section → Generate token → copy the generated token:












2. Go to the settings of the added Snapchat traffic channel template → edit → Snapchat default data source (pixel) section → fill in the values for Pixel ID and Access Token:

1094,Universal tracking script,"
What is a universal tracking script?



Universal script is one of the options we provide for the no-redirect tracking. It generates the click id in the cookie → records the click in RedTrack (based on the parameters from URL and additional info from UA) → records the traffic to the default RT campaign.





RedTrack universal tracking script has the following functions:




For affiliate marketers: it can help send traffic from multiple sources to one landing page.



For those owning an online store: it offers the possibility to track visits from various paid and organic channels.



For those using Facebook, Google, etc., alongside monitoring organic traffic on the same page: our universal tracking script can track your purchased and organic traffic separately.






RedTrack universal tracking script can be of the following types:




default - for direct advertisers and e-commerce (for those who don't have any landing or pre-landing pages).



/click support -&nbsp; for those who work with landing pages.



/pre-click support - for those who have 2 landing pages one after another before the offer page.






How to create a script



Important!The script must be added at the end of the body section. Otherwise, it might fail to trigger correctly.





1. Create target Campaigns. One of them should be a Default campaign for the unattributed (aka organic) traffic. Other campaigns are related to your paid traffic channels. Create as many as you need.



2. Generate your unique script based on your needs.



Tools → Scripts → New fill in the mandatory fields → Save:







Script type - select one of the 3 types:




default - choose this one if you plan to work with your own website (e.g. e-com store) where a visitor can click on any link or visit any tab while the target action is always tracked on some other page no matter what the visitor path was before.



/click support - use it when you lead the visitor from your landing page to a 3rd party offer and use domain.com/click CTA link format



/pre-click support - same as /click support but for a prelanding page with domain.com/preclick CTA link




Title - give your script a name.



Domain - choose a custom tracking domain that will be used in that script. Tying a concrete domain to the concrete landing page is not necessary. You can use one custom tracking domain for everything.



Default campaign - organic traffic campaign.



Attribution - set the attribution model you want to use:




First click - first recorded inbound click.



Last click&nbsp; - last recorded inbound click.



Last paid click - last recorded inbound click with tracking parameters.




We always recommend using Last paid click attribution since that is the most accurate way, measures which marketing touchpoint a customer last clicked on or engaged with before purchasing, and gives it 100% of the credit. For the First click attribution data, RT has a conversion path report.



Attribution window - set the attribution window, the period for the first click, and the last paid click models.



Cookie domain - the root domain to place a cookie. This is the root domain of your custom tracking domain.



Example: your script will run on name1.domain.com and name2.domain.com. Add domain.com as the root domain (not https://domain.com and not www.domain.com)



3. Copy the generated script and add it to your landing page code:







4. Campaign (the one for the paid traffic channel) → Tracking links and parameters → Universal script → copy the tracking parameters → add the parameters string to the traffic channel you use.







RedTrack will identify the incoming traffic based on the ""cmpid"" parameter. If there is no ""cmpid"" in the URL, the traffic will be attributed to the default organic traffic campaign.



Remember that changes to the scripts in RedTrack do not affect thescript used on your page code. If any changes are made, remember to update the script in the page code, too.





Automatically created universal tracking script



1. Add your brand. In RT go to Brands → New from scratch → use this guide for details.2. Add your website. In RT go to Websites → New → use this guide to help add your website URL and the rest of the fields in the template.



In the Scripts tab follow the suggested steps to generate your universal tracking script → proceed with the rest of the settings according to your needs → save the changes → the script can be copied from here:







Manually created universal tracking script



Apart from the website settings where you have the ready-to-use script for this particular website, you can also find the list of your scripts in Tools → Scripts. Here, you can create a new one and edit the existing one:











Fields explained: 





Select one of the 3 types:




default - choose this one if you plan to work with your own website (e.g. e-com store) where a visitor can click on any link or visit any tab while the target action is always tracked on some other page no matter what the visitor path was before.



/click support - use it when you lead the visitor from your landing page to a 3rd party offer and use domain.com/click CTA link format



/pre-click support - same as /click support but for a prelanding page with domain.com/preclick CTA link






Give your script a name.





Choose a custom tracking domain that will be used in that script. It’s better to use a custom tracking domain for the concrete website where you plan to put a script.





Organic traffic campaign.





Set the attribution model you want to use:




First click - first recorded inbound click.



Last click&nbsp; - last recorded inbound click.



Last paid click - last recorded inbound click with tracking parameters.




We always recommend using Last paid click attribution since that, in the most accurate way, measures which marketing touchpoint a customer last clicked on or engaged with before purchasing and gives it 100% of the credit. For the First click attribution data, RT has a Conversion path report.





Attribution window - set the attribution window, the period for the first click, and last paid click models.





Cookie domain - the root domain to place a cookie. This is the root domain of your website.



Example: your script will run on name1.domain.com and name2.domain.com. Please specify domain.com as the root domain (not https://domain.com and not www.domain.com.





Keep in mind that changes to the scripts in RedTrack do not affect the actual script used on your page code. If any changes are made, remember to update the script in the page code, too.

1178,Multi-currency support,"
What is multi-currency support?



Multi-currency support feature allows you to receive the payouts and costs in different currencies and transform them into your account currency based on the European Central Bank rate. Rates are updated twice a day.



Mind that for the payouts to be counted correctly the currency in your RT Traffic channel/ Offer source/ Brand settings should correspond to the value of the currency set in your partner account.



How to set up multi-currency feature?



To set up the multi-currency, perform the following simple steps:



1. Set the default account currency in your account settings. To do that go to the burger menu→ Settings→ General→ select the needed currency from the drop-down:



Be careful as currency can be set only once. A change can be made only upon the request. For more details on this matter contact your sales representative or support@redtrack.io.







2. Set the default currency for your Traffic channel and Offer source/ Brand:





Traffic channels→ Currency drop-down:







⚑ Traffic channel currency is the currency of your traffic costs.⚑ The currency you set in RedTrack in the settings of your Traffic channel should be the same as the currency set in your partner's account (Facebook, Google etc.), otherwise, there will be miscalculations in the payout reports.





Offer source/Brand → Currency drop-down:







⚑ Offer source/ Brand currency is the currency of your conversion payouts.⚑ The currency you set in RedTrack in the settings of your Offer source/Brand should be the same as the currency set in the account of your affiliate network, otherwise, there will be miscalculations in the payout reports.





Now your costs and payouts will be transformed into your account's default currency. For example, if your conversion payout is in EUR, RedTrack will change it to USD based on the European Central Bank rate so like that you have accurate statistics if your costs are in USD or any other currency.

Digistore24 is a platform for transforming the world of online business through automation and conversion optimization.



Integration





Before you proceed with the integration, make sure to have the already added:




Custom tracking domain



Traffic channel






1. Add Digistore24 as an Offer source in RedTrack.



Offer sources → New from template → find digistore24 template → Add → copy the Postback URL→ Save the template:











Refer to this article for details on Offer sources in RedTrack.



2. Set up RedTrack Postback URL in Digistore24.



Important insights about Digistore24 conversion tracking!1. Digistore24 allows you to track conversions in 2 ways: by adding to the end of the postback URL dynamic macros supported by Digistore24 or &amp;type=yourconvtypename. You can combine the two ways or use only one of them. But mind that the workflow for setting up conversions tracking via each way is different.2. There is a special workflow for Initiate Checkout event tracking. The details for each case are described below↓





1. Study the correlation between Digistore24-supported dynamic macros and the events you should add in RedTrack.



Digistore24 supports 4 dynamic macros. Each macro corresponds to the events you want to track with its help:




{transaction_type}&nbsp;= payment, refund, chargeback.



{order_type}&nbsp;= initial_sale, upsell.



{billing_type}&nbsp;= single_payment, subscription, installment



{billing_status}&nbsp;= paying, completed, aborted.




Use only the macros corresponding to the conversion types you want to track. You don't need to add all of them if that's not your case.



So if you want to track such events as ""payment, refund and chargeback"" you should add them to RedTrack and add {transaction_type} macro to the end of the Postback URL in digistore24. Use this table for a reference:

2. Add the events you want to track with Digistore24 in RedTrack. To do that go to Tools → Conversion tracking → Conversion type. Refer to&nbsp;this guide&nbsp;for details.







Event names in RT should be the same as they are spelled in Digistore24 (small letters, with or no spaces, etc.)



3. Add the needed macro(s) to the end of your Postback URL in Digistore24.





1. In your digistore24 account go to Account → S2S postback → Add s2s postback integration:







2. Add the copied postback URL from RT to the Postback URL field → add the needed macro to the end of the URL string → mark the needed events in the For order event field → Save:







It goes one macro per one postback. To add another macro, you need to add another postback. 





This video tutorial will help you set up the postback on the digistore24 side if you have a vendor account (e-com setup)







You can use a custom name for the event you want to track. To do that:



1. Add the event(s) you want to track with Digistore24 in RedTrack. To do that go to Tools → Conversion tracking → Conversion type. Refer to&nbsp;this guide&nbsp;for details.

3121,Publishers: coupon tracking,"What is a coupon and why it may be useful?
Coupon is a unique code that may be assigned to your publisher/partner in order to promote the links. You can assign conversions to a publisher/partner based on the coupon value used. Coupons will override any click data and will attribute conversion to the publisher/partner that used coupons.
How to create a coupon?
To create a coupon, you need to set your coupon token for a publisher/partner and coupon value for the campaign. When combined, they will give a unique publisher/partner coupon for a campaign that will look like “token-value”.
To set the coupon tracking act as follows:

1. Go to the created Campaign and press the Edit icon next to it:



2. Once you are in the Campaign settings go to the tab Details For Publishers:



3. Add the {pubtoken} token and the value to it:



4. Go to the Publishers section-&gt;Publishers -&gt; Edit:



5. Scroll down to the Coupon token field and set your coupon there:



6. Now, you can Login as publisher/partner:



7. Go to Campaigns -&gt; choose the target campaign and check the coupon. This is how your publishers/partners will see it on their side. They can copy it and use it for tracking:
Note!

To send coupon data to RedTrack please use postback macro: coupon=coupon_value (example: coupon=vandatest-20off).

3143,Google Tag Manager and RedTrack,"
Our tech team has prepared a step-by-step guide on how to integrate Google Tag Manager (GTM) with RedTrack, you can find it below. Since it is an advanced tutorial, it is not covered by the RedTrack Support. Knowledge of web design languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript may be required. We suggest hiring an expert if you are not comfortable proceeding with this guide on your own.







The guide below is meant for those who already have a GTM account and the connected domain. In case you don't have one, click here to check out what to do first.



1. Create a variable to get clickid from the cookie. Variables→ New→ 1st Party Cookie: 



Values to be added:Variable Name: rtkclickid-storeVariable Type: 1st Party CookieCookie Name: rtkclickid-store







This is a container for the clickid you have stored in a cookie (for the script to take this value on some page where it will be needed). Do not change the naming.



2. Create a Tag:



2.1 Go to Tags→ New:







2.2 Add the essential elements:



Name: any convenient name (use the one that is easy to identify)Type: Custom HTMLHTML: Place the Universal tracking script you are going to useTrigger: choose where you want the script to fire (in our example, it is All Pages)









Add the GTM code to your website (landing page). To do that:



1. Press the Tag id here:







2. Add the GTM codes to the page header and body as is stated in the window:







This is the only thing you will need to add to your page code. All other scripts and triggering conditions are set on the GTM side.





It will depend on your flow and can be either a simple no-redirect flow with a landing page and affiliate offer or a complex website with various triggers.



Both GTM and RedTrack functionality allow you to play with the settings, but here are the basic things you will need to set up in RedTrack:



1. Add the Campaign, which is the fundamental element in RedTrack. The whole tracking is linked to the campaign. You will most likely be using a custom way of tracking conversion and sending a postback so you can skip the postback setup.



2. Add a custom tracking domain. This is a must nowadays as all service domains are more likely to be treated as malware.



3. Adjust the postback trigger. This trigger can be used to fire the postback URL:



Create GTM Tag that sends S2S URL with clickid attached&nbsp;with the following options:



Tag Name: RedTrack Payment CompleteTag Type: Custom ImageImage Url: your actual S2S url with parameter clickid={{rtkclickid-store}} addedTriggering: the page where you want the postback to be fired, or the click on the button







Your RedTrack S2S postback URL template can be found under Tools→Conversion tracking:







☛ You may want to play with triggers to create a correct subsequence (for example, when the clicked fails to be recorded quickly).☛ There can also be different event-triggering settings - it all depends on your current flow (the elements are created the same way we have described above).☛ GTM allows you to play with your settings in different ways. Having GTM integrated with RedTrack, you are ready to explore more. Here is more information on the functionality.

Offer source and Offer&nbsp;(if you’re an Affiliate)/&nbsp;Brand and Website&nbsp;(if you’re an Advertiser)



Conversion types you're planning to work with






1. Add&nbsp;EvaDav&nbsp;as a Traffic channel in RedTrack.



Go to your RedTrack account →&nbsp;Traffic channels&nbsp;→&nbsp;New from template&nbsp;→ find&nbsp;EvaDav&nbsp;→&nbsp;Add&nbsp;→&nbsp;Save&nbsp;the template:











2. Create a campaign in RedTrack with EvaDav&nbsp;as your traffic channel.



Campaigns&nbsp;→&nbsp;Create new campaign&nbsp;→ use&nbsp;this guide&nbsp;for Affiliates /&nbsp;this guide&nbsp;for Advertisers to help you add the campaign with EvaDav as your traffic channel → once the Campaign is added, your tracking link is automatically created, copy&nbsp;Click URL:

In Campaign settings (created in step 2) scroll down to&nbsp;S2S Postback for EvaDav&nbsp;→ Add&nbsp;→ check if all the needed parameters are in place →&nbsp;Save changes&nbsp;to the campaign:











Important!▸ If you changed the Postback URL in the Traffic channel (added/removed some parameters to it), remember to manually update the link in Campaign settings as well, as it won’t be generated correctly automatically.▸ Some Traffic channels require you to edit the Postback with specific parameters for each Campaign (e.g., the goal for Exoclick or ap_key for Go2Mobi). If the field remains blank or something like “REPLACE” is stated, that means you need to define the Postback conditions manually.

The Referral Program allows publishers/partners to earn additional commission from referrals they will attract to the system. Referral gets the commission based on the Campaign cost settings. It can be either the campaign cost itself or a custom payout set on the campaign level. You as a publisher/partner who has attracted the referral will gain a commission from the referral commission.



This Referral program feature is activated upon the request for an additional fee. Please get in touch with your Product Specialist or support@redtrack.io for advice.



The referral program can be activated in 3 ways:





If you want all of your Publishers within this Whitelabel to get a commission, switch on the Activate Referral Program toggle within the settings of the Whitelabel your Publishers belong to-&gt; fill in (customize) the fields in this section:







Here are the things you can customize:



 ▸Additional program URL - any custom link you want to use for the purpose. It can be a link with your own backend integration, or some API integration. We will&nbsp; still add a unique value to the link so the system can identify the referral and attach him to your account correctly.



 ▸ First level commission - a&nbsp; commission earned by a publisher/partner who has attracted the referrer directly



 ▸ Number of steps - the depth of your referral program (how many publishers/partners in the funnel will be able to get the commission from a newly acquired referral)



 ▸ Commission decrement - how much less the publishers/partners in the funnel will get compared to the one who has attracted the referral directly.









If you want the commission to be paid only to certain (most earning) Publishers:



1. Go to the section Publishers-&gt; choose the needed Publisher account (s):







2. Scroll down to the section Referral program-&gt; switch on the Activate Referral Program toggle-&gt; fill in (customize) the fields in this section:







Here are the things you can customize:



▸Additional program URL - any custom link you want to use for the purpose. It can be a link with your own backend integration, or some API integration. We will&nbsp; still add a unique value to the link so the system can identify the referral and attach him to your account correctly.

 ▸ Number of steps - the depth of your referral program (how many publishers/partners in the funnel will be able to get the commission from a newly acquired referral)



 ▸ Commission decrement - how much less the publishers/partners in the funnel will get compared to the one who has attracted the referral directly.



Since you want to pay only to certain publisher(s), toggle Activate Referral Program should be deactivated within the Whitelabel settings for all the other publishers:













You can also have both scenarios: pay a certain percentage to certain Publisher(s) and pay a certain percentage for the rest of your Publishers. To implement these scenarios, use the settings from both tabs ""For all publishers"" and ""For certain publishers only"".  









Example:Let’s imagine we have the following setup for a referral program:  · First level commission is 50%  · Number of steps is 2  · Commission decrement is 25%This is how it will work:





Multiple Postbacks feature presupposes that only certain conversion types (chosen by the branded portal Admin) will be sent to the publishers/partners.This feature is pretty tricky so get in touch with your Product Specialist to make sure you really need it.



To apply this feature:1. Add the needed conversion types to RedTrack. To do that you go to Tools-&gt;Conversion tracking-&gt;Conversion type. Click here for more info on how to manage conversion types:







2. Turn on the Multiple Postbacks toggle:







3. From the list of added conversion types enable the ones you want your publishers/partners to see and press Save:







4. Go to Publishers-&gt; next to the needed Publisher Id navigate to the icon Login as publisher/partner:5. Select the tab Postback:







6. Add the Postbacks to the enabled (within step 7.3) conversion types and press Save:

2. Add the needed scripts from RedTrack to Shopify:





1. Copy the scripts from the added Website form.



 Websites → choose the needed one → Scripts → choose Shopify → copy the scripts:









If you have the Offer form and no automatically generated scripts, then you need to:




Create and copy the universal tracking script. Use this article → I'm affiliate section.



Copy this Web events tracking Events.js script:




&lt;script src=""https://yourtrackingdomain.com/events.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;





2. Add the copied scripts to your Shopify account.



2.1 Sales channels → Online Store → Themes → three dots → Edit code:







2.2 Layout → theme.liquid → add the copied scripts to the end of the&nbsp;&lt;head&gt;&nbsp;tag:







If you change the theme, remember to add the scripts to the new theme again.

Legacy scripts for Order status page and Post purchase page can be still found in your Website form in the Legacy scripts for Order status page and Post-Purchase page drop-down:





If you have the Offer form and no automatically generated pixel, copy it from here:



analytics.subscribe('checkout_completed', (event) =&gt; {
  const checkout = event.data.checkout;
  const orderId = checkout.order.id;
  var s = document.createElement( 'script' );
  s.setAttribute('src', 'https://tracking.domain/order_completed.js?shop=storedomain.myshopify.com&amp;orderid=' + orderId);
  document.body.appendChild(s);
});





2. Add the copied pixel to your Shopify account.



2.1 Settings → Customer events → Add custom pixel → give it a name → Add pixel:











2.2 In the Permission window mark Analytics → in the Data sale window mark Data collected qualifies as data sale:







2.3 Paste the pixel (copied in step 1) into the Code section → change the tracking.domain and store.domain parts with your actual domains → Connect:









3. Create Webhooks.



Settings → Notifications → Webhooks → Create webhook:



Webhook API version is always the latest. It is crucially important for you to choose the latest version of Webhook API from the dropdown. Usually, the latest Webhook API version is marked with the current year and the word (Latest) at the end.

However, CAPI accepts only the data attributed to your Facebook campaign, meaning only the conversions with Facebook click id and additional parameters can be accepted by Facebook as original conversions and be attributed to your campaigns and still, there are a lot of exceptions.



But Facebook, like many other traffic sources, has a tool that allows you to upload a bit more conversions offline. This is not the same as if the CAPI sends those conversions, but they can also teach the algorithm. Conversions uploaded offline will not necessarily be attributed to your Facebook campaigns, but they will still be used in the optimization process.



For example, let's say your campaign has brought 10 conversions and only 5 were from Facebook. But the other 5 can also be used to show Facebook what converts better. Like that, you have twice as many conversions that can be used for the optimization.



Offline conversion upload suits those who own an online store website can get the PII data from the partner. Facebook will not accept offline conversions without a Facebook Email set in the Additional parameters section of the Offer source/Brand template:









To upload offline conversions act as follows:



1. Go to Events Manager→ Data sources→ choose the Offline event set→ Settings→ copy the Offline event set id:



Check out this article in case you're missing the default offline event set.







You don't need to upload any .csv files. Everything is done with the API. Why it's better? No manual work. All your conversions are uploaded offline once RedTrack records them.



Make sure you have connected your target ad account (accounts) to that offline pixel:



2. Go to your RedTrack Offer/Website settings→ CAPI→ Connect Facebook:







You can’t use offline event sets until the terms of service are accepted.



3. Once integration permissions are accepted, add your Offline event set id→ match your RedTrack conversion types with Facebook conversion events→ Save the changes to the template:







This matching will show Facebook where and to what category to add your offline conversions. Keep in mind that there is no option to customize Facebook conversion types.

3476,WooCommerce and RedTrack,"








WooCommerce (WooCom)&nbsp;is a flexible, open-source commerce solution built on WordPress. WooCommerce empowers small and medium businesses to build exactly the store they want and sell online.



Integrations steps





Make sure to have the added сustom tracking domain.



RedTrack supports plugins for Subscription tracking such as YITH WooCommerce Subscription and official WooCom subscriptions. As for the upsells, RedTrack supports WooFunnels Funnel Builder Pro. For more details on WooCom subscription info click here.





1. Create custom conversion events.



1.1 Before you add the events for WooCom in RedTrack study these 2 categories of WooCom events which can be tracked with RedTrack:





1st category includes standard events which will be tracked once these events are&nbsp;added to RT&nbsp;and the WooCom &lt;-&gt; RT integration is done as per this guide. These events are:




ViewContent



AddToCart



InitiateCheckout



Purchase






2nd category of events are custom ones. They are:




Subscription



Upsell



Downsell



OrderBump




In order to track the events of the 2nd category, in addition to the WooCom plugin you also need to get WordPress (WP) plugins aka funnel builders. These plugins/funnel builders are:&nbsp;One Click Upsell,&nbsp;WooFunnels, and Upsell Order Bump.



Check out which events can be tracked with each additionally added plugin/funnel builder for WooCom:



WP type of the plugin/funnel builder for WooComOnce Click UpsellWooFunnelsUpsell Order BumpYITH WooCommerce SubscriptionConversion events, that will be counted when using this plugin typeViewContentViewContentOrder BumpSubscriptionAddToCartAddToCartInitiateCheckoutInitiateCheckoutPurchasePurchaseUpsellUpsellSubscriptionSubscriptionDownsellDownsellOrderBump



Pay special attention to the following:☛ Although such events as “Subscription” and “Upsell” are tracked 100 % with such additional plugins as “One click upsell”, “WooFunnels” or “YITH WooCommerce Subscription”, in theory, they can also be tracked with any other plugins. That being said, the decision to test other plugins (except for “One click upsell”, “WooFunnels” or “YITH WooCommerce Subscription”) for tracking these events can be a bit risky due to this workflow not being entirely tested and verified.☛ For the “Purchase” event to be tracked in RedTrack, the order must have the status Completed / event marked payment_complete in WooCom.☛There is a difference between Upsell and Downsell:Upsells are products that you recommend instead of the currently viewed product.Downsell offer is the one that you make to your customer after they’ve turned down your initial upsell offer. So if the customer didn’t accept your upsell offer, you can still increase their AOV by offering a downsell:☛ Purchase vs Subscription:If a customer sells subscriptions, his purchases = subscriptions.If the customer sells goods or services, his purchases = purchases.





1.2 To add the events in RedTrack go to Tools → Conversion tracking →&nbsp;Conversion types → set the events for WooCommerce. Use this guide to help you with conversion events in RedTrack.



2. Create a custom&nbsp;Brand.



Brands → New from scratch → use this guide to help you add your Brand



The specified title of the shop will correspond to the Brand name. The newly created Brand will serve as a placeholder for the tracking parameters.



3. To send the PII data for better attribution go to the added Brand settings →&nbsp;Additional parameters&nbsp;→ add the following parameters with the corresponding roles:



ParameterMacro / TokenName / Description (what you'll see in reports instead of subx)RoleInfo we receive under these parameterseventid{replace}Event IDEvent IDYour order ID or the external ID for the conversionfname{replace}First NameFirst NameCustomer First Name from the orderlname{replace}Last NameLast NameCustomer Last Name from the orderphone{replace}PhonePhoneCustomer phone number from the orderemail{replace}EmailEmailCustomer email from the orderzip{replace}Zip CodeZip CodeCustomer zip code from the ordercontentid{replace}Content IDContent IDsExternal product IDcontent{replace}ContentContentsProduct titlecontenttype{replace}Content CategoryContent CategoryThe type of product







4. Add your&nbsp;Website.



Websites → New → use this guide to help you add your website



Once you’ve added your Website, you already have the universal tracking script generated for you automatically. To get it, in your Website form → Scripts → choose WooCommerce from the E-com integrations drop-down → copy the script:



5. Create a paid traffic campaign.



The campaign for the unattributed (organic) traffic is already in place. Now you need to create the one for the paid traffic. To do that:




Add the&nbsp;Traffic channel. Most of them have a preset template in RedTrack.



Launch a campaign&nbsp;for the paid traffic channel. Your website/shop will be the main link added to the traffic channel.






Check out our video tutorial on how to add the RT plugin for WooCommerce and a universal tracking script to it or continue with the steps below.



1.&nbsp;Download the&nbsp;RedTrack.io plugin for WooCommerce&nbsp;to your computer:







2. Login into the WordPress admin panel and navigate to the&nbsp;Plugins →&nbsp;Add New Plugin → Upload Plugin:







3. Press Choose file → upload the downloaded&nbsp;RedTrack.io plugin for WooCommerce&nbsp;from your computer → Install Now → Activate Plugin:











4. Go to Plugins → Installed Plugins → find the downloaded plugin → press Settings:







5. For the events to be tracked accurately you need to do these 3 actions precisely:




Add the universal tracking script.



Check the boxes next to the needed events in settings of the added WooCommerce plugin.



Add the checked events in RedTrack.

What it is



For affiliate marketers who need to test various complex funnels, RedTrack provides an opportunity to track landing page click parameters in case your strategy includes variations of landing pages when the address of the page (URL) stays the same. This feature will help you identify which variation of your landing page brings more traffic.



This feature usually works out for the scenario lander → offer.



How it works



You should have landing page edit rights to change the CTA button.



Go to your landing page → edit code → in the CTA button link after the /click insert the parameter (e.g. sub9) and the name of your landing page variation (e.g. variation):







Choose only empty subs which aren't filled in with any parameters. On the screenshot below sub 9 to sub 15 parameters are empty and can be used for that purpose:



It's called a ""variation"" only in our example, you can name your landing page variations as you wish and add them in accordance with the quantity. Remember to put the correct signs in the code. Meaning, separate /click with ""?"", put ""="" after subs and separate the parameters with ""&amp;"".  Example: https://club.rdtk.io/click?sub9=variation1&amp;sub15=variation2



If you need that additional parameter value to be passed to the affiliate network, they work the same way as the traffic channel subs. Here is more info. 



Check the results



These additional parameters are checked the same way as those you receive from the traffic channel. Check out this guide for a more detailed explanation.

2. Remember to implement the basic settings in the branded partner portal in the correct order:



2.1 first you need to add a Domain. Refer to the Publishers: adding a domain article for details.



2.2 then you add a Whitelabel. Refer to the Publishers: adding whitelabel article for details.



2.3 only after that do you move on to creating a Campaign and adding Publishers/Partners. Refer to the Publishers: creating a campaign and Publishers: adding publishers articles for details.



Remember that if you break this sequence and add a whitelabel first or add publishers/partners and only then add the domain, it will cause a conflict forcing you to start the settings all over again.



3. Once you've added the domain, Whitelabel, created the Campaign, and added publishers/partners you can proceed further with:




Publishers: settings for publisher



Publishers: managing payouts



Publishers: coupon tracking

4753,Tags,"
Tags: overview



Tags in RedTrack are special symbols (emojis) or text added to the RT entities (campaigns, offers) to distinguish them from / relate them to each other, or emphasize some of them:







Specifics of tags:




They are added to campaigns and offers and tracked by the same principle.



Can be added in both cases: when creating a new entity or editing an already existing (added) one.



You can add either some text or an emoji, or you can add both, they can work together as well as independently from each other.




Applying tags



Let's see how the tags work on the example of the already created Campaign (the same principle is applied for offers):



1. Within the added campaign settings go to the section Tags and notes → Show more → add the Text and/or Icon for your tag → Save changes to the campaign: 

















2. With the help of the added tag you can view the tagged campaign in the report and filter campaign by certain tags:





Campaigns → Columns → add the Tags column to the campaign overview (report):







Once you've saved the changes, the chosen tags will appear next to the Campaign in the Tags column:









Campaigns → select the needed tag from the Tags filter → Apply:

5198,Publishers: deeplink,"What's Deeplink?
Deeplink is a hypertext link to a page on a Web site other than its home page. These links are also used to send users directly to an app instead of a website or a store. Thus, when using deep links you do not get to the home page by default, but rather go straight to the specific in-app / website location (category of goods) or a concrete product. By using deep links partners/publishers save time and traffic.

Deeplinks are used to help partners/publishers promote several different links/ offers within one Campaign.
To create and apply the Deeplink you need to:
1) Have an RT Campaign with a Traffic channel ""For Publishers"";
2) Access to the branded portal.

Setting up a Deeplink
1. Create Deeplink(s) in the RT Campaign with the Traffic channel ""For Publishers""

[expand title=""Expand to see how to create preset Deeplinks""]

1.1 go to the list of your Campaigns and choose the needed Campaign:



1.2 once you are in go to the tab Details for Publishers:



1.3 scroll down to the end of this page till the section Preset DeepLinks-&gt; press Add Deeplink:



1.4 fill in the needed fields-&gt; press Save Details-&gt; Save Changes:


Hint!

 	Deeplinks Direct URL is a link that leads directly to the Offer URL.
 	Deeplinks Redirect URL is a link that leads to another link different from the Offer URL. Redirect URLs forward traffic from one URL to another when the old URL no longer exists.
 	Deeplinks Impression URL is the link meant to collect impressions, not leads.


1.5 (optional) With RedTrack it is possible to hide unnecessary tracking links in the Publisher Panel. To do that turn off the toggle next to the link which you want to hide (Direct tracking URL/Redirect tracking URL/Tracking URL/Impression URL):


Note!

All the URLs in the Preset DeepLinks section are enabled by default. Once you turn off the toggle next to the needed URL (Direct tracking URL/Redirect tracking URL/Tracking URL/Impression URL), this URL won’t be shown in your Publisher Panel (Campaigns-&gt; choose the needed campaign).

Example:

I decided to hide the Impression URL, so I turn this toggle off, then go to my Publisher Panel and see that Impression URL is missing from the REDIRECT TRACKING URLS section:

 ⇒

And if you turn on the Impression URL toggle, this URL will appear in your Publisher Panel:

5939,Conversions inconsistency,"
A typical conversion path in RedTrack looks as follows: a click comes from the Traffic source → gets to RedTrack → is fixed in RedTrack as a conversion.



There are 3 sets of data where inconsistency may occur:




Conversions in the backend of the affiliate network, e-com, etc.



Conversions in RedTrack



Conversions in the traffic channel






Here is the list of conversion inconsistencies that can be fixed by our Support team:



1. Wrong dynamic parameters were put in the offer URL/postback URL.



2. Integration expired, is wrong.



3. Issues with the custom domain (e.g: it's not integrated yet, SSL certificate is not set for this domain, etc.).



4. Conversion cap is used.



5. Duplicate postback mode is set incorrectly.



6. Protected postback is used.



7. Issues with the server.



8. Different time zones are used.



9. The most typical one is human errors. Meaning, you probably skipped or misunderstood some steps in the integration guide, so it's the issue with the settings of your offer, traffic channel, campaign etc.





1. Different attribution windows used by different traffic sources.



Let's break this down on the example of Facebook and Google Ads:





By default, Facebook uses a 1-day view and 7-day click-through attribution window. Google, by default, uses a 1-day view and 30-day click-through attribution window. It means that if someone clicks your Facebook ad and then converts on your site within 7 days, both Facebook and Google will take “credit” for that conversion. Why is this weird? Let's figure this out: a user clicks your Facebook ad today, checks out your site, but does not convert. Five days from now they click your Google Ad and ultimately make a purchase. And this is what happens with your stats five days from now when that sale actually occurs:



→ Facebook will show that you had 1 sale for whatever Facebook ad the user clicked today;→ Google will show that you had 1 sale for whatever Google ad the user clicked right before they purchased.



So you only had one sale, but according to Facebook and Google you had two sales because they’re both taking credit for the same sale. Actually, the default attribution settings for both Facebook Ads and Google Ads will cause them to take credit for conversions that occur even if a user doesn’t actually click your ad.





Your Facebook ad is displayed in the user’s feed today, then tomorrow they search you up on Google and click your Google Ad, and ultimately make a purchase. Facebook is going to once again take credit for the sale even though the user didn’t click your Facebook ad or probably didn’t even see your Facebook ad, and yet Facebook takes credit for the sale.





2. Cross-device tracking.



And again the most obvious examples can be provided based on Facebook and Google Ads:



To perform any type of cross-device tracking, the ad platforms like Facebook and Google require the user to be logged in on all of their devices, all the time.



Suppose I'm a user who clicks the Facebook ad on my phone. I click some ad, opt in on the landing page, but then get distracted and leave the site. A few days later I'm using my desktop computer at work, check my email, and see an email from you. I click the link and ultimately end up buying something.



That’s great, except I wasn't actually logged in to my personal Facebook account on my work computer so Facebook couldn’t track me. This type of thing happens all the time, every day. Moreover, some browsers and security apps are now actively and completely blocking the tracking codes from major ad platforms like Google, Facebook, and YouTube.



All this contributes to inaccurate stats, not to mention Facebook using their short 7-day attribution window. To clarify: if someone clicks on your Facebook ad and doesn't buy within 7 days, those sales will never be tracked at all by Facebook



3. Do not expect 100% for conversions.



Especially if we are talking about bigger networks using algorithmic attribution (i.e. Facebook).



Sometimes, you simply cannot rely on the conversion stats in your ad accounts. The record shows that such major networks like Facebook and Google misattribute or just completely miss somewhere about 20-50% of your conversions or even more.



As for the other so-called advanced attribution settings offered by Facebook Ads and Google Ads, just know that they’ll actually result in even more “illusive” sales, more incorrectly attributed sales, and even bigger problems for 99% of advertisers.



In general, when talking about Facebook, it will never show a 100% match, as it has its own algorithms and they may reject the conversion for no reason at all.





The bottom line is that RedTrack matches the backend, does unbiased attribution based on your settings, and is all about your overall ROI and effectiveness, not increased spending with any particular channel. So, if your tracking is set up correctly, rely on your RedTrack data. Otherwise, why would you use a tracker at all?

6107,Landing page before e-com shop,"
The most common funnel or e-commerce is driving the traffic directly to the shop, either to the main page or to some product. But sometimes, you might need to use a landing page in between, an additional step to increase the conversion rate, for example. If this is your case, then this article will help you to set it up in a proper way so as not to lose the click information on the way.



Within this type of setup, there are 2 different scenarios possible:1. Your landing page has the same domain as the e-com store2. The domains are different.



Follow the steps below, depending on your case:





For example, your landing page domain is landing.example.com, and your e-com store is placed on the same domain shop.example.com.



1. Take the universal tracking script you created for your e-commerce shop (with a cookie domain equal to your root domain: example.com in our example).



2. Place the universal tracking script on your landing page code.



To all the pages if there are a couple of different variants of the landing page on this domain.



3. Proceed with the shop integration if you haven't set up one.





Example: your landing page domain is landing.com, but your e-com shop's domain is shop.com



1. Integrate RedTrack with the shop.



2. Create one more default campaign for this landing page. 



Name it somewhat like ""Default Campaign for LP""  to distinguish it from other Campaigns and use it in step 3 below.



3. Create a dedicated universal tracking script for this landing page where:




Choose this option in the Script type field:



The cookie domain will be landing.com (the root domain of your landing page);



The Default Campaign will be the one created within step 2 above (i.e. Default Campaign for LP)




4. Place this universal script into your landing page code.



5. Set the condition for your landing page to lead to your e-commerce shop store. It is done via GTM with the help of the special script created for that purpose:



Set the trigger to be fired on all clicks.



&lt;script type=""text/javascript"">
 (function() {
    function getCookie(name) {
    var value = ""; "" + document.cookie;
    var parts = value.split(""; "" + name + ""="");
    if (parts.length == 2) return parts.pop().split("";"").shift();
    }
 var utmInheritingDomain = ""https://outbounddomain.com"", links = document.getElementsByTagName(""a"");
    var rtClkId = getCookie('rtkclickid-store')
 for (var index = 0; index &lt; links.length; index += 1) {
   var tempLink = links[index].href,tempParts;
   if (tempLink.indexOf(utmInheritingDomain) > -1) { 
     tempParts = tempLink.split(""#"");
     console.log(tempLink)
     if (tempParts[0].indexOf(""?"") &lt; 0 ) { tempParts[0] += ""?"" + 'rtkcid=' + rtClkId  } else { tempParts[0] += ""&amp;"" + 'rtkcid=' + rtClkId }
     tempLink = tempParts.join(""#"");
   }
   links[index].href = tempLink;  
 }
}());

if (parts.length == 2) return parts.pop().split("";"").shift();
}
var rtCookie = getCookie('rtkclickid-store')
//create request with its properties (you can add to the postback &amp;type=transaction &amp;status= &amp;event= &amp;sum= like in custom image postback)
var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
request.open(""GET"", `https://tracking.domain/postback?clickid=${rtCookie}&amp;type=ViewContent`)
//optional - to read our response code :create callback for success containing the response
request.success = function(response) {
console.log(response);
};
//optional - to read our response code : and a fail callback containing the error
request.fail = function(error) {
console.log(error);
};
//and finally send it away
request.send();
&lt;/script&gt;

Attribution window&nbsp;– set the attribution window, the period for the&nbsp;first click, and&nbsp;last paid click&nbsp;models.Cookie domain&nbsp;– the root domain to place a cookie. This is the root domain of your website4. Once you&nbsp;save&nbsp;the changes, the ready-to-use script will be generated, copy it6. Add the landing page (optional)Being an affiliate, you will be using a landing page in most of the cases. Although this step is not obligatory.1. Go to Landers → New → Add the name and the URL of your landing page and choose the tracking that you are going to use for this lander.All other settings are done on your side.2. By scrolling down the lander settings, you will find a CTA button URL - Click URL.Copy it and replace the URL leading to your offer (hop-link) on your landing page with this link. You can add additional parameters to the URL, ex: /click?sub15=variation1 to have additional data on your landing page performance.3. Add one of the tracking scripts to the page code (step 5): head or the bodyRefer to this article for details on how to add your landing page to RT7. Add custom conversion eventsIf your affiliate network supports tracking of various conversion events, you can see them in RedTrack as well. To do that:1. Go to Tools → Conversion Tracking → Conversion types2. Add the conversion types you need. Names should match the names your affiliate network will send to you3. Set the duplicate postback mode for each of the events according to your business needs* Refer to this article for details on conversion types* Refer to this article for details on duplicate postback 8. Add the postback on the affiliate network side1. Go to offer sources → open the one you added within the step 22. Copy the URL from the Postback URL section3. Go to your affiliate network and add the URL to the postback settings4. If there are several conversion types available, use this format of the postback URLs:https://docs.trk.agency/postback?clickid=replace&amp;sum=replace&amp;type=conversion_typereplace: your affiliate network macroconversion_type: the name of the conversion type you apply the postback for9. Start running traffic1. Create the campaigns in your traffic channel and add RedTrack links to start receiving the traffic data. Use the redirect campaign link (Tracking links and parameters →&nbsp;Redirect) only for the traffic channels that accept redirects.Use the landing page URL + the tracking parameters (Tracking links and parameters → Universal script or No-redirect) for the other cases. Another important step is to enable the&nbsp;Auto update costs&nbsp;toggle inside the campaign settings in the right corner.Refer to this article for details on how to apply the auto update cost feature in RT9.1 GoogleGoogle is tricky as different campaign types require adding tracking parameters to different sections.1.

In case you want to use the no-redirect tracking or your traffic channel asks to use this method only, instead of the tracking URL add the landing page URL and the tracking parameters where needed. Refer to this page for the list of the traffic channels RT has an extended integration with or simply a guide10. Start receiving conversion and revenue data (+ad spend for API integrations)You will start receiving the cost data from the integrated traffic channel automatically with the frequency available for your subscription.Here is the accuracy we can guarantee:– API integrated traffic channel is sending us the cost data, there are no errors in the logs– For the non-API traffic channel: the costs are set and working (set on a campaign level, received via the macro, updated manually)The visitor makes the purchase/desider action, and the affiliate network sends the purchase or other conversion information back to RedTrack. We guarantee a close to 0 discrepancy for the conversion data between your affiliate network and RedTrack. For the cases when you use the universal tracking script, the conversion distribution between the paid and organic campaigns may vary since RedTrack normally attaches the conversion to the specific touch points tracked.Do not hesitate to ask for any help at this point:&nbsp;support@redtrack.io

Magento&nbsp;is a powerful, open-source eCommerce platform that allows businesses to easily build and manage online stores. 



Integration steps





1. Add custom tracking domain.



2. Add conversion events:



Go to Tools → Conversion tracking → Conversion type → use&nbsp;this guide&nbsp;to help you add the needed events.



The full list of Conversion types used for successful Magento integration includes:- ViewContent- AddToCart- InitiateCheckout- Purchase



3. Add Magento as a Brand in RedTrack



3.1 Brands → New from scratch → use this guide to help you fill in the rest of the fields.







The specified title of the shop will correspond to the Brand’s name. The newly created Brand will serve as a placeholder for the tracking parameters.



3.2 To send the PII data for better attribution go to the added Brand settings →&nbsp;Additional parameters&nbsp;→ add the following parameters with the corresponding roles:

4. Add your Website:



Websites → New → use&nbsp;this guide&nbsp;to help you add the website (your offer).



 Once you’ve added your Website, the universal tracking script is generated automatically. To get it go to the added Website form → Scripts → scroll down to the field Universal tracking script and copy it (as you will need it later to insert in Magento):



5. Create a paid traffic campaign:



The campaign for the unattributed (organic) traffic is already in place. Now you need to create the one for the paid traffic. To do that act as follows:




Add the&nbsp;Traffic channel. Most of them have a preset template in RedTrack: API-integrated traffic channels/ Non-API integrated traffic channels.



Launch a campaign&nbsp;for the paid Traffic channel. Your website/shop will be the main link added to the traffic channel.






1. Install Magento extension to your website. It can be done in 2 ways:





Download this .zip extension file → check out&nbsp;this guide&nbsp;for further guidance.





Check out&nbsp;this video tutorial&nbsp;for details.





2. Add RedTrack universal tracking script to Magento



Copy the universal tracking script from RT (Setup in RedTrack → step 4) → go to your Magento account → Universal script → add the RT script → save the changes:

RedTrack.io has developed API and CAPi integrations with 20+ ad networks to cover multiple automation scenarios.





The purpose of this feature is to feed data back to the ad network for better attribution and automation by ad network AI.



Besides multiple S2S postbacks, RedTrack.io users can leverage pre-built conversion APIs (CAPI) to send data back to the ad network. Unlike S2S you can opt-in to send ALL conversions (including conversions from other channels) to the ad network compared to sending only conversions attributed to the clicks from that ad network.

The purpose of this feature is to demonstrate real-time cost data in RedTrack.



RedTrack can update your campaign performance data with accurate costs every 30, 15, or 5 minutes. The frequency and depth of cost updates depend on channel API and your subscription plan.



The table below demonstrates Traffic channels and their attributed levels of auto-cost update:

Cost update level depends on the subscription plan: it’s Ad set for Advanced users and Ad for Team &amp; Enterprise users.



Check out this video to figure out the API Cost update logic in RedTrack.





These rules are applicable depending on the Traffic channel and the depth of their integration level with RedTrack.





The purpose of this category of rules is ad waste prevention. Pause rules can be of the following types:




Pause Campaign



Pause Ad set



Pause Ad



Channel Placement




These rules monitor the performance of objects (campaign, ad set, ad, placement). When user-specified criteria are met, the set rule will pause the objects to prevent ad waste.

The purpose of this category of rules is ad waste prevention as well. Meaning, these rules monitor the performance of objects (campaign, ad set, ad, placement). When user-specified criteria are met, the set rule will pause the objects to prevent ad waste. The rule will continue to monitor paused objects’ performance. Should this performance improve because of delayed conversions, they will be reactivated.



Pause and Restart rules&nbsp;can be of the following types:




Pause &amp; Restart Campaign



Pause &amp; Restart Ad set



Pause &amp; Restart Ad




Check out the table below on which types of Pause and Restart rules are currently available for the RT integrated Traffic channels:

The purpose of this category of rules is to scale successful Campaigns. These rules monitor the performance of objects (campaigns, ad sets). When user-specified criteria are met, the set rule will try to improve overall performance by increasing bid, budget, or by duplicating ad sets.



Scale rules&nbsp;can be of the following types:




Change Campaign budget



Change Ad set budget



Change Ad set bids



Duplicate Ad set




Check out the table below on which types of&nbsp;Scale rules&nbsp;are currently available for the RT integrated Traffic channels:






Facebook







Facebook




















The purpose of this category of rules is to reduce manual work. Schedule rules do a specific action at a pre-set time, at scale. The most common example is switching objects on/off or raising bids during the hours determined by the user.



RedTrack is currently working on adding the possibility to apply these rules to the major traffic channel players.





If you haven’t found your traffic channel in this list, email us to&nbsp;support@redtrack.io. We’ll be glad to add it for you.

8238,Typeform and RedTrack,"




Typeform&nbsp;is a web-based platform you can use to create anything from surveys to apps, without writing a single line of code. 



When integrating Typeform with RedTrack, it's essential for you to connect GTM to each added form in the Typeform account. According to the Typeform guidelines, you can add Google Tag Manager to a form only if you have a Business Typeform account. 





1. Add the rtclickid parameter to Typeform



1.1 Go to your&nbsp;Typeform profile → Create typeform:







1.2 Create → Logic →&nbsp;Personalize with data →&nbsp;Hidden fields:











1.3 Add new field → give these fields names&nbsp;rtclickid&nbsp;and&nbsp;contact_type → Save&nbsp;to apply the changes:







2. Add Webhook to Typeform



2.1 In your Typeform template go to the tab&nbsp;Connect →&nbsp;Webhooks →&nbsp;Add a webhook:







2.2 Insert the URL for your Webhook→ Save webhook:







The URL should be of the following format: https://yourdomain.rdtk.io/postback/custom/typeform/API key. Where:- instead of yourdomain.rdtk.io you put RT’s default subdomain which can be found in Tools→Domains→Create new domain:- your API key can be found in RedTrack→Tools→Integrations→General:





1. Add&nbsp;custom tracking domain



2. Set up&nbsp;conversion tracking



So far, the only Typeform event that can be added to RedTrack is&nbsp;Lead. To set it up go to&nbsp;Tools → Conversion tracking → Conversion type → name the event&nbsp;Lead:







Refer to this guide for details on conversion types functionality in RT. 



If webhook doesn’t count the incoming conversions as Leads, these conversions will fall under the category of the Default Conversion type=Conversion.



3. Add your&nbsp;Brand and Website&nbsp;(for Advertisers) /&nbsp;Offer source and Offer&nbsp;(for Affiliates)



When you added the Brand/Offer source, remember to assign the following roles:*Email*Phone 



4. Create a paid traffic campaign



– For Advertisers, the campaign for the unattributed (organic) traffic is already in place once you add your Website.– Affiliates should add the campaign for the unattributed (organic) traffic as per this guide.



To create a campaign for the paid traffic follow these simple steps:




Add the&nbsp;Traffic channel. Most of them have a preset template in RedTrack.



Launch a campaign&nbsp;for the paid Traffic channel. Your website/shop will be the main link added to the traffic channel. Be guided by&nbsp;this article&nbsp;for Advertisers /&nbsp;this one&nbsp;for Affiliates.






To set up GTM correctly, you must have the already-generated universal tracking script.* For Affiliates: use this guide to help you with the universal tracking script.* For Advertisers: a universal tracking script was created automatically once you had added your Website.Both Affiliates and Advertisers can find the generated universal tracking script in Tools → Scripts:



1. Adjust the settings in GTM



1.1 Follow&nbsp;this guide&nbsp;on how to integrate Google Tag Manager (GTM) with RedTrack.



Make sure you’ve created a 1st party cookie variable under the name rtkclickid-store. Without this variable, further GTM integration with RT will not work out.



1.2  In GTM settings Create 3 types of Tags: 





Essential elements:

cookie += ""; expires="" + now.toUTCString();

}

 

document.cookie = cookie;

}

&lt;/script&gt;





2. Connect&nbsp;GTM&nbsp;to Typeform



For the integration to work, you need to connect GTM to each added form in your Typeform account. According to the Typeform guidelines, you can add Google Tag Manager to a form only if you have a Business Typeform account. 



2.1&nbsp;Copy your&nbsp;Google Tag Manager Container ID.



2.2&nbsp;Go to your Typeform account → open the needed form → activate the tab&nbsp;Connect → Integrations → find&nbsp;Google Tag Manager → Connect:







2.3 Paste the GTM number to the popped-up form → Save:

What is a campaign?



It is a set of rules and elements that link together a traffic channel and the website being promoted. The main purpose of creating a Campaign as an element in RedTrack is to get the final link to which you will send the traffic and where you will check your website performance. A campaign is a combination of all possible settings you can have per promoted website.



How to create a campaign?





Before you proceed with campaign creation, make sure you already have the following elements in place these elements:




Custom tracking domain



Traffic channel



Brand and Website






1. Campaigns → &nbsp;Create new campaign:







2. Edit/adjust each the needed blocks as per the tips below:





1. Give your Campaign a name.



2. Choose the&nbsp;Traffic channel.



3. Select the&nbsp;custom tracking domain.



4. Choose the&nbsp;Campaign Cost model&nbsp;and fill in the&nbsp;Value&nbsp;accordingly if applicable:









Select the store / Website you added earlier.



In case you have several websites or funnels, you can set a different weight for them (to make the system distribute the incoming traffic accordingly), but keep in mind that this option works only for redirect links. 









This option can be changed if you plan to work with a redirect link. Be careful, as not all the traffic channels support it. 



Redirect types decide how redirection to the offer is handled and whether the referrer data is passed through. First of all, click&nbsp;here&nbsp;to learn how the hidden referrer works and choose the required redirect type based on their explanation below:




""Regular redirect (http/s 302)"" is a standard temporary HTTP redirect that sends a visitor directly to the desired location (the offer you promote). The referrer data is passed to the campaign endpoint.



""Meta refresh with hidden referrer"" presupposes that after the redirect happens, another redirect takes place with the help of an HTML meta tag. As a result, the referrer points to RedTrack, not the initial referrer.



""JS refresh"" is similar to the meta refresh type, but it’s fulfilled with the help of JavaScript. That being said, this type is not generally recommended for SEO because search engines can have difficulty crawling and indexing sites that rely on them.



""Server redirect (http/s 302) with hidden referrer"" means the referrer is hidden when redirecting on the side of the TDS header.



“Double meta refresh with hidden referrer”&nbsp;is similar to&nbsp;“Meta refresh with hidden referrer”&nbsp;but this method involves using two meta refreshes to mask the original source of the traffic, making it more challenging to identify where the user initially came from.



“Regular redirect (http/s 307)”&nbsp;is similar to&nbsp;“Regular redirect (http/s 302)”&nbsp;but it’s working more efficiently with old version browsers.




To sum up,&nbsp;Server redirect (HTTP/S 302) with hidden referrer&nbsp;is faster than&nbsp;Regular redirect (HTTP/S 302)&nbsp;and&nbsp;Meta refresh with hidden referrer. This is because a server redirect is processed on the server side, while a&nbsp;meta refresh&nbsp;and&nbsp;JS refresh&nbsp;are processed on the client side. Server redirects are faster because the server does the work of redirecting the request for you, whereas in a meta refresh or JS refresh the client has to do this work. Moreover, server redirects can be cached, making them even faster.









This section is&nbsp;optional. It serves for adding tags and additional notes to distinguish the added Campaigns. Click&nbsp;here&nbsp;to learn more about tags and notes.









Leave this field empty for Facebook, Google Ads, Bing Ads, Tiktok and all other traffic channels with RedTrack CAPI integration. 



To add /edit the postback, go to S2S Postback for &lt;your traffic channel&gt; → Add → add/edit the postback URL (or multiple URLs if that’s the case) → make sure that all the needed values for the source parameters are in place → define the&nbsp;Payout sent → select the&nbsp;Postback method → Save changes to the campaign:











Postback method types explained:- GET requests only retrieve data and have no other effect. For retrieving resources without making changes, GET is preferred over POST, as they can be addressed through a URL.- POST method requests record data. For example, it is used for posting a message to an Internet forum, subscribing to a mailing list, or completing an online shopping transaction. Also for this method you can write your own JSON with the fields accepted by the 3d party platform.



IMPORTANT!- If you changed the Postback URL in the Traffic channel (added/removed some parameters to it), remember to manually update the link in Campaign settings as well, as it won’t be generated correctly automatically.- Some Traffic channels require you to edit the Postback with specific parameters for each Campaign (e.g., the EVENT_NAME for Taboola or ap_key for Go2Mobi, etc.). If the field remains blank or something like “REPLACE” is stated, that means you need to define the Postback conditions manually.The screenshot above is just for demonstrative purposes. The URL, its parameters, etc, depend on your Traffic channel.





This option is available for traffic channels that have CAPI integration with RedTrack.







Refer to this article to set up the API Integration conditional postback.





3. Enable the Auto update costs feature if your traffic channel is eligible for it. Refer to this guide for details.









There are some extra tabs that can be filled in as per your needs:









These tabs are enabled only if you have access to and use the partner management portal and work with individual publishers who promote your offers. A traffic channel “For Publishers“ is to be used from the template. 



Refer to this article for more details on the portal.









Refer to&nbsp;this article&nbsp;to help you set up custom payouts.









This is the manual cost update. Refer to&nbsp;this article&nbsp;for more details on the process.





The URL field in this section serves as the destination URL where the impressions info is going to be sent in case impressions are collected within this campaign. Add the Impression forwarding URL only if your traffic channel supports this option. 











4. Once you're done with all the Campaign elements, save it → go to Tracking links and parameters → choose the tracking method&nbsp;and copy the automatically generated&nbsp;values/URLs:







Use the redirect link for the traffic channels that support the redirect method, website URL + no-redirect/universal script + the tracking parameters for those who accept no-redirect only.

8669,Create a traffic channel,"
What is a traffic channel?



Traffic channel (ad network, any place with the traffic) is where you get your traffic from. It can either be a paid channel of traffic like Google Ads, Facebook, MGID, Propellerads, etc., or your own website with organic traffic. In both cases, it is obligatory to add it to your account.



Traffic channels in RedTrack can be added in one of the following ways:




Via template, which means that your traffic channel has the API integration with RedTrack and has a pre-set table with all the necessary data, or maybe it's not integrated via the API, but we have the template for this channel with some pre-set data.



From scratch, which means that your traffic channel has not been integrated with RedTrack yet, and it needs to be added in a custom manner.




This is where you can see the list of API-integrated traffic channels and look into the ways they are integrated with RedTrack (capi, cost updates or rules).This is the list of non API-integrated traffic channel templates available in RedTrack.



How to add a traffic channel





1. Traffic channels → New from template → find your traffic channel in the catalog → Add:







When adding the Facebook template, you can already see that it is integrated with RedTrack via API, allowing the clients to explore such automation features as Cost update, Campaign pause, Pause creative:Check the Traffic channel integration status for more information about integrations and their features



2. Once the traffic channel template pops up, Save it:







3. Since you added this channel from the template, all the necessary info has already been preset. At this point, you can edit the following data in the template:




Cost update depth and frequency:








This feature is available only for integrated traffic channels. Check out the Cost auto-update article for more info on this feature.




Currency




In the template, it is set by default according to your account settings. You can change it from the currency drop-down:








Additional parameters




These parameters are preset depending on the integration type. Thus, not all of them can be changed. Parameters not available for editing are marked in grey:







It's essential to use the parameters under the same subs as they are set in the template. Otherwise, the integration will not work.



Check out this video explaining how the Roles in RedTrack operate.



4. That's not all you should/may do to your traffic channel template, but the rest of the changes depend on the added traffic channel. You may need to adjust the postback URL (if that's how you're tracking conversions), set up the integration, add pixels, etc. To go on with your traffic channel settings:



a. Go to the list of our guides for each traffic channel: API integrated channels/Non-API integrated channels.b. Find your channel and continue adjusting the settings according to your needs as per the guide. 





1. Traffic channels →  New from scratch:







2. In the New Traffic channel&nbsp;window, fill in all the necessary fields:







Fields in the screenshot explained:(1) Give your traffic channel a name.(2) Set the currency by choosing it from the drop-down. (3) S2S Postback URL can be obtained from your traffic channel, and it should contain a valid clickid macro supported by this traffic channel. The clickid macro should be equal to RedTrack {ref_id}. If you need to send the payout info, use RedTrack {offer_payout} macro. The changes in the S2S postback URL are not replicated to your campaign settings automatically, you need to add/update the postbacks manually in each campaign used.(4) Click id  (for tracking the clicks from your channel of the traffic and associating them with the conversion data and sending the postbacks back to the traffic channel later).(5) Click cost macro.(6)-(9) If your traffic channel supports any other additional tracking parameters (utms), you can add them in the Additional parameters section of your traffic channel template. Add the values for Parameter, Macro, Name and assign the roles for the added parameter. Refer to this video explaining how the Roles in RedTrack operate.(10) Save changes to the template.

Refer to this article for details on Tags.8. Save to apply the changes in your offer to move on to the next tab.





Caps are the limitations applied to your offer. It can be related to the conversion amount, unique visits, or clicks.  When the cap is reached, the offer will be temporarily removed from the rotation, and RedTrack will stop sending traffic to it.



Unique visits



A unique visits cap allows you to limit the number of times each particular offer will be shown to the same visitor. If the visitor has exceeded the limit, he is a non-unique visitor and will be directed to the other offer within the same Campaign/Funnel. If only one offer is added to the Campaign, a non-unique visitor will be redirected to the fallback URL or if there is none, the click will be ignored.







▸ Unique visits by IP are determined by the IP address of the computer or device (by default, it is a daily filter).▸ Unique visits by users are determined by info stored in the cookie (by day, by week, and by month).▸ Non-unique clicks will not be counted towards events included in your RedTrack plan.



Conversion cap



The conversion cap allows you to set a daily limit of conversions for a particular offer. When the limit of conversions is exceeded, the traffic will be automatically redirected to the other offer within the same Campaign/Funnel or to the fallback URL.







▸ Turned on toggle Alert when cap is reached means that you will be notified upon reaching the cap via email.▸ The conversion cap sets a daily limit of conversions, which means that the traffic will be redirected automatically back to the main Offer after 24 hours.



Click cap



The offer click cap option can limit the number of clicks you want to receive for a particular offer. The same as with a conversion cap, when the limit of clicks is exceeded, the traffic will be redirected to the other offer within the same Campaign/Funnel or to the fallback URL.







▸ Use Alert when cap is reached to be notified upon reaching the cap via email.▸ The click cap option also sets a daily limit of clicks, the traffic will be redirected automatically back to the main Offer upon a new day. 





This tab is only for Facebook tracking! It allows you to add your Facebook pixels to send the conversion data back to Facebook with the CAPI.







These are the values that will be used as default values in case you decide not to fill in the corresponding fields for each pixel:1. Default action source: this is the conversion source for the default FB pixel. ""Website"" is a recommended option.2. Default website URL: this is the URL of your verified domain. Please use ""https://domain.name"" URL structure.❢ The default action source and website URL can be left empty only if you fill them on the pixel level.

What is a campaign?




Campaign in RedTrack&nbsp;is a set of rules and elements that link together a traffic channel where you buy the traffic and the offers that are being promoted. In RedTrack terms, a Campaign works as the combination of an offer, a landing page, a traffic channel, a domain, filters and the automation you have set up. 



The main purpose of creating a Campaign in RedTrack is to get the final link you will send the traffic to. This link allows you to route your traffic, collect all the possible data on the clicks and have the option to change anything inside without changing the link itself for the traffic channel (we know how important it is).



How to create a campaign?





Before you proceed with campaign creation make sure you already have the following elements in place:




Custom tracking domain



Traffic channel



Offer and Offer source



Landing page (if you have one)






1. Campaigns → &nbsp;Create new campaign:







2. Edit/adjust each the needed blocks as per the tips below:





1. Give your Campaign a name.



2. Choose the&nbsp;already added&nbsp;Traffic channel.



3. Select the corresponding&nbsp;custom tracking domain.



4. Press on the needed&nbsp;Campaign Cost model&nbsp;and fill in the&nbsp;Value&nbsp;accordingly:









You don't need to add/remove/adjust anything here at this point. This block will automatically generate the links and the tracking parameters for you to copy and paste into your platform settings later. 









This option can be changed if you plan to work with a redirect link. Be careful, as not all the traffic channels support it.



Redirect types decide how redirection to the offer is handled and whether the referrer data is passed through. First of all, click&nbsp;here&nbsp;to learn how the hidden referrer works and choose the required redirect type based on their explanation below:




“Regular redirect (http/s 302)” is a standard temporary HTTP redirect that sends a visitor directly to the desired location (the offer you promote). The referrer data is passed to the campaign endpoint.



“Meta refresh with hidden referrer” presupposes that after the redirect happens, another redirect takes place with the help of an HTML meta tag. As a result, the referrer points to RedTrack, not the initial referrer.



“JS refresh” is similar to the meta refresh type, but it’s fulfilled with the help of JavaScript. That being said, this type is not generally recommended for SEO because search engines can have difficulty crawling and indexing sites that rely on them.



“Server redirect (http/s 302) with hidden referrer” means when redirecting on the side of the TDS header, the referrer gets hidden.



""Double meta refresh with hidden referrer"" is similar to “Meta refresh with hidden referrer” but this method involves using two meta refreshes to mask the original source of the traffic, making it more challenging to identify where the user initially came from.



""Regular redirect (http/s 307)"" is similar to “Regular redirect (http/s 302)” but it's working more efficiently with old version browsers. 




To sum up, Server redirect (HTTP/S 302) with hidden referrer is faster than Regular redirect (HTTP/S 302) and Meta refresh with hidden referrer.

Moreover, server redirects can be cached, making them even faster.









This section is&nbsp;optional. It serves for adding tags and additional notes to distinguish the added Campaigns. Refer to this article for details on tags and notes.









Leave the fields in this section empty for Facebook, Google Ads, Bing Ads and Tiktok as RedTrack passes conversion data to these sources via API.



To add /edit the postback go to the section S2S Postback for &lt;your traffic channel&gt; → Add → add / edit the postback URL (or multiple URLs if that’s the case) → make sure that all the needed values for the source parameters are in place → define the&nbsp;Payout sent → select the&nbsp;Postback method → Save changes to the campaign:











Postback method types explained (step 4):- GET requests only retrieve data and have no other effect. For retrieving resources without making changes, GET is preferred over POST, as they can be addressed through a URL.- POST method requests record data. For example, it is used for posting a message to an Internet forum, subscribing to a mailing list, or completing an online shopping transaction. Also for this method you can write your own JSON with the fields accepted by the 3d party platform.



IMPORTANT!- If you changed the Postback URL in the Traffic channel (added/removed some parameters to it), remember to manually update the link in Campaign settings as well, as it won’t be generated correctly automatically.- Some Traffic channels require you to edit the Postback with specific parameters for each Campaign (e.g., the goal for Exoclick or ap_key for Go2Mobi). If the field remains blank or something like “REPLACE” is stated, that means you need to define the Postback conditions manually. The screenshot above is just for demonstrative purposes. The URL, its parameters, etc, depend on your Traffic channel. If you're not clear about the mandatory parameters for your postback please turn to your Account Manager.





This option is available for Facebook, Google Ads, Bing Ads and Tiktok







Refer to&nbsp;this article&nbsp;to set up the API Integration conditional postback.





3. Add the needed funnels:







A funnel&nbsp;is a set of landing pages, offers, filters, auto-rules, and weights applied. You can add more than one funnel (and more than one Landing page and Offer) when creating/editing your Campaign. Clicks will be distributed between funnels (landing pages and offers) according to the weight. Consider this for the advanced tracking while conducting&nbsp;A/B (split) tests.





Choose an offer → assign the weight:







You can add more than one offer to the funnel. RedTrack will distribute the traffic between offers according to the specified weight.





Choose Landing+Offer → Add your landing and offer and assign the weights to them:







☝ You can add more than one landing page and offer to the funnel. RedTrack will distribute the traffic between Landing pages and Offers according to the specified weight.☝ If you have a landing page that contains links to multiple offers with a separate button each, you can track their performance in RedTrack with the help of Listicle functionality. Refer to this article for details. 





Choose Prelanding+Landing+Offer → Add your prelander, landing page, and offer and assign the weights to them:









Imagine you are using complex flows that include several landing pages/offers/filters/complex weights and you need to use one of these combinations within several campaigns with different traffic sources. You don’t want to spend more time creating the same funnels each time (especially if there are hundreds of campaigns). A&nbsp;funnel template&nbsp;is a solution for you in that case: you will need to create it once and then only choose the correct template for as many campaigns as you need.



To set up a funnel template act as follows:



1. Funnel template → Create new funnel:







2. Fill in the mandatory fields in the funnel template →&nbsp;Save:







Fields explained:(1) Give your template a name.(2) Choose the Funnel template type:(3) Switch on the Show filters for funnel toggle if you want to preset the filters for your funnel template:- you can adjust the filters by the Filter preset (if you already created one) or manually by choosing the needed value from the Add filter field:- once you decide on the way and choose the filter you may need to choose the Type and Value for your filter. Use the article Traffic filtering to figure out how to effectively set your filters(4) Add the values to your Pre-Landing/Landing/Offer blocks. These blocks will appear depending on the option you chose in the Funnel template type (Single landing, Multi landing, Only offer):● Single landing → Landing&amp;Offer:● Multi landing → Pre-Landing&amp;Landing&amp;Offer:● Only Offer → Offer:Add your Pre-Landing&amp;Landing&amp;Offer press Add or New Pre-Landing&amp;Landing&amp;Offer → set the Weight for your Pre-Landing/Landing/Offer → add filters to the added entities:



Additional filters for objects (Pre-Landings/Landings/Offers) inside the funnel serve for distributing the traffic not only for funnels but also for offers/landings/pre-landings inside this funnel. Use the article Traffic filtering to determine how to set your filters effectively.



3. Add this template to your campaign. To do this go to your Campaign settings → Funnels →&nbsp;Template&nbsp;→ find your&nbsp;funnel template: 







4. If necessary, you can convert your template back to a regular funnel. To do that, press the&nbsp;Convert&nbsp;button:







You can make any changes to your funnels when needed. The changes will be replicated within the campaigns where this template is already in use.





4. Switch on the auto optimize toggle to set the funnel optimization and add the filters.







5. Enable the&nbsp;Auto update costs&nbsp;feature if your traffic channel is eligible for it. Refer to&nbsp;this guide&nbsp;for details.







6. Set the advanced rules for your campaign to get more from the data you have. Refer to&nbsp;this article&nbsp;to help you set up&nbsp;rules.





There are some extra tabs that can be filled in as per your needs:









These tabs are enabled only if you have access to and use the partner management portal and work with individual publishers who promote your offers. A traffic channel “For Publishers“ is to be used from the template. 



Refer to&nbsp;this article&nbsp;for more details on the portal.









Refer to&nbsp;this article&nbsp;to help you set up custom payouts.









This is the manual cost update. Refer to&nbsp;this article&nbsp;for more details on process.





The URL field in this section serves as the destination URL where the impressions info is going to be sent in case impressions are collected within this campaign. Add the Impression forwarding URL only if your traffic channel supports this option. 









Email to support@redtrack.io for assistance with the setup of the throttling feature.








4. Once the Campaign is saved go to Tracking links and parameters → choose the tracking method&nbsp;and copy the automatically generated&nbsp;values:







Use the redirect link for the traffic channels that support the redirect method, no-redirect script for your Landing page code, etc. Refer to these articles for details on the preferred method of tracking:– Universal script– No-redirect– Impressions

9752,Service Level Agreement (SLA),"
What is an SLA?



A service level agreement (SLA) is a documented agreement between a service provider and a client that identifies both the services required and the expected level of service.



Overview



Effective Date: 01/03/2021Last Review: 08/01/2023Next Scheduled Review: 20/11/2024



This Service-Level Agreement, effective as of March 1, 2021,&nbsp; is made by RedTrack.io and between RedTrack.io and its clients.



RedTrack.io cares about all clients and tries to do its best to keep an excellent service level. This document aims to make the interaction with clients most effective to deliver service always on time.



Here, you will find the terms and conditions for the system availability, all types of additional services we provide, and the types of interactions.



The objectives of this Agreement are to:




Provide a thorough understanding of service ownership and the roles and responsibilities.



This Agreement represents a description of the services provided by RedTrack.io.



Match understandings of expected service provision with actual service support &amp; delivery.






Definitions



Client - any RedTrack.io paid clientService Specialist - RedTrack.io Activation, Support or Development SpecialistActivation - the process of helping a client to start using our product and receive the first results to scale his businessFeature implementation - the process of implementing a feature not currently available in the appReasonable availability - evaluate the risks and be available if anything urgent happens or if immediate assistance is required, provide all the necessary informationService Packages - a combination of features included in a subscriptionExpected response - &nbsp;a response/resolution to the client's query or the ETA provision if&nbsp; the issue requires more investigation. Does not include the autoresponse, it is the first interaction with a real specialistDowntime - is the overall number of minutes RedTrack.io was unavailable during a quarter (i.e., February 1 through April 30 and every three months).





Service scope



This Agreement covers the following Services:




&nbsp;Product



&nbsp;Client Support



&nbsp;Client Activation






Service agreement





Product: downtime



RedTrack.io calculates unavailability using server monitoring software to measure the server-side errors, ping test results, web server tests, and website tests.



Downtime excludes the cases:




Slowness or other performance issues with individual features (custom scripts used on the page, ""heavy"" pages, additional redirects, apps, and plugins used)



Issues that are related to external apps or third parties (slow internet connection, ""heavy"" applications open, various browser extensions)



Any features identified as beta or similar



Scheduled downtime for releases






Product: uptime commitment



Uptime is the percentage of total possible minutes RedTrack.io was available during a quarter.



Our commitment is to maintain at least 99.9% Uptime.





Product: scheduled downtime



Sometimes, we need to perform short maintenance for a release to keep RedTrack.io working smoothly and have all the useful features you may need.



The downtime period is up to 10 seconds in that case, and it does not affect tracking.





Urgency levels and priority for Support Service



  



Live chat support



The live chat service was created for quick question resolutions: something fast or extremely urgent (for us to react as fast as possible). It's 1-line support.



In live chat support, we do not cover funnel setup, onboarding/funnel activation, complex integrations, or script implementation as they require additional time and sometimes the involvement of several specialists. These kinds of questions are to be addressed to the 2-line support.



Interaction is established by using an in-app chat window available in your account's left corner if included in the subscription.



The expected first response for a live chat is 10 minutes. Grown up to 60 minutes within the high load periods and for non-urgent cases.





Email support



This service covers all types of questions and is available any time of the day, any timezone. That means you can write anytime. We will receive your request and put it in a queue. If it is out of working hours, the morning specialist will start processing it as soon as the working hours start. 



Email support covers the 2-line support and also all requests from the clients who do not have a live chat included in the subscription.



The processing of email inquiries is as follows: we prioritize the request (impact + subscription + urgency defined by a client) and address it to an appropriate department or specialist. The higher the priority we define is, the faster the processing is.



Interaction is established by writing to support@redtrack.io



Expected response  - either a response/resolution of your case or the ETA for the resolution

Urgency levels and priority for other services





Activation assistance



It's a standard account activation for our clients.



We do understand RedTrack is not plug-and-play software and help you to start so you can see the value of the product. Activation services available vary depending on your subscription package and the particular use case.



Terms of activation are defined individually after the setup evaluation with our specialist.





On-demand service



An extra cost service is provided upon request after the activation is finished or not included in the subscription.&nbsp;



The pricing and terms are stated only after the request evaluation and are individual from case to case.





Personal manager



Your personal manager will guide you through the product, be available to answer any questions afterwards, provide advice on the best platform usage, and escalate any of your issues with a higher priority.



A personal manager is available 10:00 A.M. to 7:00 P.M, Monday to Friday GMT+3. The request resolution depends on the complexity (deep analysis, check, dev team involvement, etc.)

What's Dashboard in RedTrack?



Dashboard is the first page (tab) you see after logging in to your RedTrack account. It displays overall statistics about the clicks and conversions from your Campaigns.



How to work with Dashboard in RedTrack?



1. Choose the data slices by which your report will be filtered:







2.&nbsp; Select the needed metrics (clicks, conversions or certain conversion types, costs etc., whatever you need to be depicted in the report) and press Apply/Refresh:







Keep in mind that in order to see the costs you need to turn off the Show costs toggle and, consequently, turn it on to filter the data without the costs (to get a quick report):



3.&nbsp;Once the chosen data was filtered and the Apply/Refresh button was pressed, the Chart will show you the data by the chosen metrics. By navigating the mouse to certain parts of the chart you can spot the changes to your conversions (or else) over the chosen period:



Each metric has its own color which makes it easier to trace the changes on the Chart:metric A-greenmetric B-orangemetric C- violetmetric D-pink







4. There is also a block at the bottom of the page that contains quick reports on main metrics and you can also choose the grouping type to filter the data properly:

What's Ads Manager?



The Ads Manager tab in RedTrack provides information about where your traffic originates based on RT_roles that you can set up for all your tracking links. The idea behind the report is to present all the data across all campaigns in a familiar layout for those who are used to working with Facebook / Google Analytics reports.



RT_roles should be configured in the traffic channel template (in most templates the roles are already in place):



Parameter Name/DescriptionRoleCampaign IDCidAdgroup IDGidAd IDAidPlacement IDPid







Ads Manager is available for all traffic channels, but only several of them are eligible for automation at the moment:- Meta (Facebook): manage objects with ID (campaign, adset, ad) and manage daily budget.- TikTok: manage objects with ID (campaign, adset, ad).



If Ads Manager or certain features within it are not visible/available in your account please contact sales@redtrack.io.



How to work with Ads Manager



1. On the main RedTrack menu go to Ads Manager → press cogwheel to manage (add/delete) the data slices (RT_toles):







2. Within the chosen data slice you can:





To analyse the report within a chosen data slice, filter it by Date → needed Offer/ Brand or Traffic channel or simply Search by ID object/ID → press Apply/Refresh: 









You can decide yourself which columns you want to see in the report. To customize your columns click on this icon: 







Refer to the Columns guide for details about this functionality.





This feature is currently available only for Facebook and TikTok.



If you update the budget on the FB side, in RedTrack the actual data (status) will be updated every 30 minutes.



Without going to your Facebook/TikTok account you can enable or disable objects with ID (API integration works by Campaign ID, Adgroup and Ad ID) in RedTrack via Ads manager. To do that you need to enable/disable the ON/OFF toggle next to the needed object:









This feature is currently available only for Facebook. 



If you update the budget on the FB side, in RedTrack the actual data (daily budget) will be updated every 30 minutes.



In the Daily budget column you can change the budget amount at the Campaign or Adgroup level depending on the settings. To do that click on the pencil icon → add the budget amount in the modal window → click Save to apply the changes:

What's a Conversion Path report in RedTrack?



Conversion path report in RedTrack shows you the most popular paths users take to complete conversions. Basically, this report demonstrates you how the clients make a decision before the actual purchase (your Offer added to RedTrack).



Conversion Path report is available only for the Advertiser plans: Grow, Scale, Prevail, Custom.



How to work with the Conversion Path report?



1. Conversion path select the needed Offer → choose the data filters: Granularity (source type), Conversion event, Date, Lookback period → press Apply:







Filters explained:





Granularity is the source type. Number of data slices shown in the Granularity filter depends on the type of subscription you're on.



Core granularity types explained:




Source: traffic channel.



Rt Source: parameter set in your traffic channel settings → ""Additional parameters"" section.



Campaign: campaign which you created and launched to set the process of tracking in motion.



RT Campaign: parameter set in your traffic channel settings → ""Additional parameters"" section.



Entry page: this filter is still under development, but in the future, it's going to be named Funnel and tracked correspondently.






For the events to be shown in this filter you need to add them first.





Add the filter by Date and Loockback period to get the data within the set period.



The difference between the Date filter and the Lookback period filter:☛ In the Date filter, you sort out the data for a certain period.☛ The Lookback period filter shows the statistics only within a certain chosen path. This data picker is set for 30 and 60 days.30 days are granted by default. To get the 60 days filter, you must address sales@redtrack.io to upgrade your subscription plan.





2. Once you see the report pay attention to the special markers:









Colors represent different traffic channels:




green - Google.



blue - Facebook.



grey - referral traffic etc.






Numbers next to traffic channels mean the number of users clicking on this very page / choosing this conversion path.

10976,Reporting: campaigns,"What are reports in RedTrack?
Reports in RedTrack is a rich and functional feature that allows you to analyse your data deep and based on different slices.
Important!

Data in RT Reports filtered by ""Hour of day"" is shown based on the time zone set in your RT account, not the data chosen in the Time timezone filter.

To change the set time zone in your account go to burger menu-&gt; Settings-&gt; General tab-&gt; choose the needed time zone from the drop-down:

 
Reports can be viewed, filtered, and exported by such segments as Campaigns, Traffic sources, Offers, and Offer sources depending on your needs:


Important!

RedTrack also offers clients the possibility of enjoying a Fraud report, which is provided by our partner Fraudscore. It is possible to apply this feature if you have a ""fraud check"" option enabled on a campaign level. For more details go to the article Fraud check.
What info is shown in the Reports depending on the segment?
Campaigns
[expand title=""Expand to learn more about reports by Campaigns""]

It's a general campaign report: all clicks, CTR, revenue, offers, etc., are grouped for one particular campaign. You can ""play"" with grouping to better understand what is happening with your traffic and what combinations convert best.

You can also filter the reports for one Campaign with multiple Offers if that's the case.

[/expand]
Traffic sources
[expand title=""Expand to learn more about reports by Traffic sources""]

Reports functionality by the Traffic source segment looks the same as any other Reports, but your traffic source performs as the primary data grouping source.
If the same traffic source is used in different campaigns, you can check its performance in one place.

[/expand]
Offers and Offer sources
[expand title=""Expand to learn more about reports by Offers and Offer sources""]

Reports functionality by the Offers and Offer sources segments looks the same as any other Reports, but Offer or Offer Sources perform as the the primary data grouping sources.

As for Offers if one offer is used in different campaigns with different traffic sources, all clicks will be available in this report so you can analyze all your offer traffic in one place.

[/expand]
How to apply the Reports functionality
1. First you decide in what segment you need to view your Reports (Campaigns, Traffic sources, Offers, and Offer sources).
For your information: in our example, we will apply the functionality of Reports on Campaigns. Make sure to use the segment you need, as we've already mentioned, the interface of the Reports for Campaigns, Traffic sources, Offers, and Offer sources is pretty musch the same.
2. Go to your Campaigns, choose one and press the Report sign. It can be done in either of 2 ways:

 	via the Report icon next to the chosen Campaign, when you navigate your mouse to it:



 	via the Report button which activates when choosing the concrete Campaign:



3. Once you are in the Report, you can see the overview tab providing you with essential information on the Campaign performance: date, ROAS, impressions, clicks, CTR, LP Views etc.


Note!

Mind that it is possible to change these data slices as needed with the help of Columns: change their order, add/remove some of them etc.

[expand title=""Expand to see how to work with the Columns""]
3.1 press on the Columns button at the top of the Report window:



3.2 in the pop-up window you'll see listed all the columns (presented in the Report) to your right:

 	to remove a certain column press on the ""X"" sign next to it:



 	to add this column back in the column to your right, press the ""-&gt;"" sign:



 	to change the order of the columns press on the needed name of the column (line) and drag it to the needed place:



[/expand]

4. You can filter your Report data by Date, Time zone, and 5 more other slices. Once you've chosen the filter, remember to press the Apply / Refresh button to apply these filters:
Keep in mind that in order to see the costs you need to turn off the Show costs toggle and, consequently, turn it on to filter the data without the costs:



Hint!

To filter the unattributed (organic) traffic in your Campaign report choose Referrer — Page groupings and check what has been left out.
5. You can filter the Subs by picking the needed sub in the Choose grouping field or (in case these filters are already taken) by pressing on the Show subs filter button and setting the subs you want to be shown in the report. Once filters are chosen remember to press Apply / Refresh:



6. If needed you can also export the grouped data to a .csv file. To do that press the Export button:



7. If you need to view the same data slices in the Report over and over again, you can create a template to access the most frequently used groupings faster.

[expand title=""Expand to see how to create the template""]

7.1 to create a template insert info into all the necessary filters, press Template Management, give your template a name and press Save report as template:



7.2 to apply the template press Template management and choose from the dropdown the template you've created before / the one you need in case you've created several templates for different types of reports:

This gives you a better sense of your potential customers' conversion paths and can help to optimize even better.



Attribution report is a pro-tool designed for RedTrack clients for a better analysis.



Data slices




“First Click” Weight - sets the importance of the first click that leads to the conversion.



“Last Click” Weight -sets the importance of the last click that leads to the conversion.



“Assisted Click” Weight - sets the importance of all intermediate clicks between the first and the last click that leads to the conversion.



Conversions for - determines which conversions to include in the report.



Click Attribution window - adjusts an attribution report's lookback window (we will check all the clicks that lead to the conversion within the desired window)







How to work with the report

2. Set the rules for us to analyze the data for you:

 

 
3. Once you run the report, you will see the magic happening:

 
The system groups the conversion data based on the first and last click counts the contribution towards the results, and provides you with extended functionality, allowing you to check what traffic source converts better for different stages of a user journey.
Play with the settings, change the weights for the first and last click to have a better view and analysis.

What are Logs in RedTrack?



Logs in RedTrack include all your data about the clicks, conversions, postbacks, and cost updates. Logs contain all the information received from your source of traffic,&nbsp; affiliate network, raw click data provided by RedTrack (more than 30 data slices).



Section Logs is displayed on the main RedTrack menu and consists of 5 main log slices:




Clicks



Conversions



S2S Postbacks



API Postbacks



Cost updates








Useful to know about Logs:- You can export you log data, but only the filtered data can be exported. The data can be filtered based on date, click id, campaign, traffic source, offer source, and offer:- You can export all the data in a separate file to provide it where needed (for example in case of a click discrepancy you can grab this file and give it to your account manager for checking).- Columns include both RedTrack data and the data we receive from the traffic channel.- Columns are customizable. Here is how.



Working with log slices





The Clicks section is basically a list of all your campaigns and offer clicks. There are 2 types of clicks:




the Click itself, when a visitor clicks on your campaign tracking link or arrives on your landing page if you use the direct traffic script.



LP click, when the visitor clicks on the CTA button on your landing page.










The Conversions section is the list of conversions received from your partner: direct advertiser, affiliate network, your own ""Thank you"" page.



Log by Conversions has the following advantages:



1. In addition to the standard columns, it contains info about Pre-landings, Landings, Conversion Statuses, ISP, Postback IPs, Payout, etc.:







2. Here you can update and upload your conversion data. Here is how.





The S2S Postback section in Logs contains the information about conversions we have sent back to your source of traffic. It contains only the basic information about the conversion + the postback URL we call on our side (it's the URL you have set in your campaign postback settings). 







Postback logs can be exported and used the way you need. For example, provide it to your traffic source account manager in case of any questions with the postbacks (not received, not all of them are received, etc.).





The API Postbacks section has the info on all the postbacks sent to Google, Facebook, Bing or any other sources via custom conversion API integrations. This section has the following columns:







Logs by API Postbacks and Cost updates are kept in RedTrack in the course of 7 days only.





The Cost updates section includes the log of automatic API-based cost updates done by RedTrack.io for your campaigns. 







When the auto update cost option is on, costs are updated with the frequency from 15 up to 60 minutes on the Campaign, Adset, and Ad levels. Update of frequency and level depends on your subscription plan. The auto update cost feature is available for API integrated traffic channels only. 



Logs by API Postbacks and Cost updates are kept in RedTrack within 7 days only.

If the clickid wasn't recorded, perhaps the scripts are running at different speeds. To fix this, move the Call Tracking Tag script on the web page from the head to the body:



7. Create Ringba Pixels for RedTrack S2S postback events.



Integrations&nbsp;→&nbsp;Pixels&nbsp;→&nbsp;Create Pixel → fill in the mandatory fields → save the added pixel → add it to your Campaign:











Example of the correct RedTrack postback URL syntax: https://test.offer.com/postback?clickid=[tag:User:clickid]&amp;sum=[Call:ConversionPayout]&amp;type=LeadFor the correct RedTrack-Ringba tracking, it is essential to add the clickid token. That being said, RedTrack also supports many other dynamic parameters such as sum for conversion payout, type for conversions type you would like to record in Redtrack, etc. See the full list here.



Ringba supports many additional dynamic tokens as well. Here is the list of tokens available on Ringba.



Postback will send conversion data to Redtrack only if the following criteria are met:✔ RedTrack's clickid is recorded ✔ Ringba Pixel contains clickid=[tag:User:clickid]✔ Ringba Pixel contains RedTrack conversion type=nameYou can check if the postback was fired in Reports → Call Details → Events → Pixel Fire:



8. (optional) Pass the conversion payout or use custom conversion events with tag filters.



Ringba Pixel can also be adjusted for passing conversion payout or using custom conversion events with tag filters. Follow the corresponding tab for details:





In Ringba, two tokens can be used for the conversion payout:




[Call:ConversionPayout] - the payout a Publisher is credited for each conversion.



[Call:ConversionAmount] - the actual revenue of the conversion.




The sum parameter can also be matched with the hardcoded value of the conversion, for example, sum=10. Then, each postback-reported conversion will be recorded in RedTrack with 10 revenue.



If you need to fire the S2S postback with the conversion revenue (Conversion Amount token), switch the Fire Pixel On field to Converted. Once the conversion event from the Routing Plan is reached, S2S postback will be fired, reporting the Conversion revenue to RedTrack.



In other scenarios, the S2S postback will still be fired, but the [Call:ConversionAmount] token won’t be replaced with the actual conversion revenue (in such case, you can enter the required value manually with the sum parameter).



Check out this Ringba guide for setting up your pixel via Call Flows to pass the conversion payout.





Using Ringba's Advanced Options for your pixels gives you the ability to use custom conversion events by Tag Filters in your request.



When configuring a Ringba Pixel:



1. Advanced Options →  GET for the HTTP Method:







2. Under Tag Filters, you can specify how and when the pixels should be fired. 



For example, you could set a Tag Filter for the pixel only to fire when the Call Length is greater than 45 seconds:











With all the elements set up correctly, when a visitor clicks through your RedTrack campaign funnel, Ringba’s Tracking Tag will capture the RedTrack clickid value from the Offer URL and save it in Ringba's Reporting. Once the call converts (or other action that triggers S2S postback happens), RedTrack S2S postback will be fired, sending the conversion details to RedTrack.

11407,CRM integration: process overview,"
This scheme shows how the RedTrack CRM integration solution works:







Scheme explained:





Example of tracking parameters added to click (for FB):



cmpid=61dacf58ed62ea0001836b28&amp;sub1={{ad.id}}&amp;sub2={{adset.id}}&amp;sub3={{campaign.id}}&amp;ad_name={{ad.name}}&amp;adset_name={{adset.name}}&amp;sub6={{campaign.name}}&amp;placement={{placement}}&amp;utm_placement={{site_source_name}}&amp;utm_source=Facebook











Example of the RT script that captures clickid:



&lt;script src=”https://att.trk.agency/uniclick.js?defaultcampaignid=5e6c7d17c6565a0002738aa9&amp;attribution=lastpaid&amp;regviewonce=false&amp;cookiedomain=redtrack.io&amp;cookieduration=30″&gt;&lt;/script&gt;











✔ The hidden field default value should be set to {clickid}✔ Script that pushes value to the hidden field should work with a little delay (in GTM you can set Trigger as “All clicks”). Meaning this script should be triggered only after the universal script has already been successfully executed, otherwise, there will be no clickid value in the cookie to be pushed to the hidden field.



Example of the script:



&lt;script&gt;
function setFormClickIdValue(clickid) {
console.log(clickid)
document.querySelectorAll('input').forEach(function(el) {
console.log(el.value)
if (el.value.indexOf(""{clickid}"")&gt;-1) {
el.value = el.value.replace(/{clickid}/, clickid)
}
});
}
function getCookie(name) {
var value = ""; "" + document.cookie;
var parts = value.split(""; "" + name + ""="");
if (parts.length == 2) return parts.pop().split("";"").shift();
}
if (getCookie('rtkclickid-store') !== null &amp;&amp; getCookie('rtkclickid-store') !== undefined &amp;&amp; getCookie('rtkclickid-store') !== 'undefined') {
setTimeout(function(){
setFormClickIdValue(getCookie('rtkclickid-store'))
}, 3000)
}
&lt;/script&gt;











Example of webhook from CRM to RedTrack.io: https://att.trk.agency/postback?clickid={replace_me}&amp;type=Lead



In “type=Lead” Type defines the conversion event type. RedTrack.io supports 20 custom conversion events.



This guide will tell you everything you need to know about conversion types/events in RedTrack.



Example of the link with some of the parameters:https://custom.tracking.domain/postback?clickid={replace}&amp;sum={replace}&amp;type={replace}&amp;eventid={replace}&amp;email={replace}&amp;phone={replace}&amp;lname={replace}&amp;fname={replace}&amp;zip={replace}



In this link pay attention to the list of WebHooks / Postback meta-data parameters which mean the following:✎ clickid={replace} – clickid that you have captured.✎ sum={replace} – purchase amount (if available). If not applicable – do not send.✎ type={replace} – conversion type – ex InitiateCheckout or Purchase. Spaces and Capital letters are important as we interpret events exactly as they are.✎ currency={replace} – add if the currency is different from the one setup on the Brand level.✎ coupon={replace} – for attribution and data, provide coupon value used with purchase.✎ eventid={replace} – with event id, can also be our clickid if logic is maintained. The role should be set up in RedTrack.io UI on the Brand level.✎ email={replace} – if hashed – use SHA256 as advised by Facebook.The role should be set up in RedTrack.io UI on the Brand/Offer source level: ✎ phone={replace} – if hashed – use SHA256 as advised by Facebook .

WooCommerce (WooCom)&nbsp;is a flexible, open-source commerce solution built on WordPress. The company started in 2008 as WooThemes and in 2017 decided to focus exclusively on eCommerce. Today WooCommerce empowers small and medium businesses to build exactly the store they want and sell online. Its legacy as an all-remote company endures, growing from three founders in Norway, the United Kingdom, and South Africa to more than 150 team members in 32 countries.







Make sure to have the already added Custom tracking domain.



RedTrack supports such Plugins for Subscription tracking as YITH WooCommerce Subscription and official WooCom subscriptions. As for the upsells, RedTrack supports WooFunnels Funnel Builder Pro. For more details on WooCom subscription info click here.





1. Create custom conversion events



1.1 Before you add the events for WooCom in RedTrack study the following conversion tracking info to understand if you have all the needed elements for the correct setup:



There are 2 categories of WooCom events which can be tracked with RedTrack:





1st category includes standard events which will be tracked once these events are&nbsp;added to RT&nbsp;and the WooCom&lt;-&gt;RT integration is done as per this guide. These events are:




ViewContent



AddToCart



InitiateCheckout



Purchase














2nd category of events are custom ones. They are:




Subscription



Upsell



Downsell



OrderBump




In order to track the events of the 2nd category, in addition to the WooCom plugin you also need to get WordPress (WP) plugins aka funnel builders. These plugins/funnel builders are:&nbsp;One Click Upsell,&nbsp;WooFunnels, and Upsell Order Bump.



Check out which events can be tracked with each additionally added plugin/funnel builder for WooCom:



[wpdatatable id=3]



Pay special attention to the following:☛ Although such events as “Subscription” and “Upsell” are tracked 100 % with such additional plugins as “One click upsell”, “WooFunnels” or “YITH WooCommerce Subscription”, in theory, they can also be tracked with any other plugins. That being said, the decision to test other plugins (except for “One click upsell”, “WooFunnels” or “YITH WooCommerce Subscription”) for tracking these events can be a bit risky due to this workflow not being entirely tested and verified.☛ For the “Purchase” event to be tracked in RedTrack, the order must have the status Completed / event marked payment_complete in WooCom.☛There is a difference between Upsell and Downsell:Upsells are products that you recommend instead of the currently viewed product.Downsell offer is the one that you make to your customer after they’ve turned down your initial upsell offer. So if the customer didn’t accept your upsell offer, you can still increase their AOV by offering a downsell:☛ Purchase vs Subscription:If a customer sells subscriptions, his purchases = subscriptions.If the customer sells goods or services, his purchases = purchases.









 1.2 To add the events in RedTrack go to Tools-&gt; Conversion tracking-&gt;&nbsp;Conversion types-&gt; set the events for WooCommerce. Use this guide to help with conversion events in RedTrack.



2. Create a custom&nbsp;Brand



Go to RedTrack-&gt; Brands-&gt; New from scratch-&gt; use this guide to help you add your Brand



Once created, pay attention to the following:☛ The specified title of the shop will correspond to the Brand name. The newly created Brand will serve as a placeholder for the tracking parameters.☛ If needed you can append additional parameters to your postback and assign roles to them in the section Additional parameters:



3. Add your&nbsp;Website



Go to RedTrack-&gt; Websites-&gt; New-&gt; use this guide to help you add your website



Once you’ve added your Website, you already have the universal tracking script generated for you automatically. To get it, in your Website form-> Scripts-> choose WooCommerce from the E-com integrations drop-down-> copy the script:



4. Create a paid traffic campaign



The campaign for the unattributed (organic) traffic is already in place. Now you need to create the one for the paid traffic. Follow these simple steps:




Add the&nbsp;Traffic channel. Most of them have a preset template in RedTrack.



Launch a campaign&nbsp;for the paid Traffic channel. Your website/shop will be the main link added to the traffic channel.






Check out our video tutorial on how to add the RT plugin for WooCommerce and a universal tracking script to it or continue with the steps below.

What's a customer journey report?



The customer journey report shows a customer's path before deciding on the target actions. This report demonstrates the analyzed data on clicks, conversions, purchases, and more. Applying these insights can help you improve and target your campaign content. 



Customer journey report in RedTrack is composed based on the chosen conversion type:







Thus, if you choose Purchase → add all the relevant filters → press Apply, and you'll see the analyzed data on all the actions that led the customer to make this purchase. By data, we mean clicks, conversions, traffic sources, advertisements, etc.



Currently, the customer journey report in RedTrack:




is available for all e-com subscription plans. If you're an affiliate, contact sales@redtrack.io for advice.



can be composed only for one conversion type at a time.



generates data only for your Orders. In the future, more slices of data are planned to be added.




Prerequisites for building a report



To make the Customer Journey report work:



1. Activate the conversion type. 



Tools → Conversion tracking → Conversion type → enable the customer journey feature for the chosen conversion type:







2. Add parameters such as email and phone to your offer source/brand template. 



Offer sources/Brands → Additional parameters → add the 2 parameters → assign the roles:







It's essential to have this data on your shop/website side and send it with the conversion, otherwise the report will not work.RedTrack will receive the data with your purchases/orders and build the report. 



How to work with the report



1. Customer journey → fill in the filters → Apply/Refresh:








Traffic channels: you can choose multiple channels of traffic.



First touch and Last touch: if in the Traffic channels field, you chose several channels, in the First/Last touch fields, you can choose only the channel you're interested in. 

First touch is the channel from which the customer starts his journey toward buying the product.



Last touch is the field showing the channel where this journey ended and the action that led to the purchase or any other chosen event type.





Search by order: you can type in your order number and filter the data only for a specific order. So far, the order number is taken from Shopify and WooCommerce.



Search by customer_id: The RedTrack app is trained to provide you with customer_id info. Thus, you can filter by this ID which purchases (or any other actions/events) a certain client is interested in and the sums of money (s)he spends for this purchase.



Lookback period: is attributed to the data within a chosen order.




The difference between the Date filter and the Lookback period filter:☛ In the Date filter, you sort out all the orders for a certain period. ☛ The Lookback period filter shows the statistics only within a certain chosen order. This data picker is set for 30 and 60 days. 30 days are granted by default. To get the 60 days filter, you must address sales@redtrack.io to upgrade your subscription plan.

13197,dynamic param-s: af net dr,"
Macros (aka tokens) can be very useful, but not all affiliate networks support them. Usually, there are several ‘empty’ parameters available for integrations (one of them should be used for passing the click id value). These ’empty’ parameters do not contain any information themselves and are used to receive parameters (click ids, campaign ids, source ids) and then send this info back where/if needed. However,&nbsp;some of the networks provide additional information through the dynamic parameters.



Working with macros in RedTrack





Every tracking solution – including RedTrack – requires a postback integration to receive conversions from the affiliate network and send them to the traffic source when needed. The integration process requires the usage of dynamic parameters (macros/tokens).



In general, this integration is established in 3 simple steps:



1. Add the click id parameter to the Offer URL.



You will need to use both the network and RedTrack parameters.



You need to send RedTrack parameter to the affiliate network, and thus the macro order will be as follows:…offer_url?affiliate_network_parameter={clickid}



Our click id data will be recorded under&nbsp;affiliate_network_parameter&nbsp;in your network account.This parameter can have various names, starting from clickid and ending with some abstract ones, such as aff_sub or utm_medium.



2. Add the click id parameter to the postback URL.



Again, you will need both the corresponding parameters from the network and RedTrack here.The only difference is in the macro order: since the postback URL sends click id data recorded in the network back to RedTrack, the order will be opposite to the offer.



https://your.dedicated.tracking.domain.com/postback?clickid={affiliate_network_parameter}



This parameter is inserted with the specific placeholders used by your network ({}, [], ##, etc.) and should be the same as used in the offer URL (offer_url?affiliate_network_parameter={clickid})



3. Add the postback URL to the Affiliate Network.



Just grab the URL with the replaced click id parameter (the one described in step 2) and copy it to your affiliate network postback settings. We recommend using it for a global postback if there is such an option.





Some affiliate networks have dynamic parameters with data: {status}, {targetid}, {campaignid}, etc.. You can use this data for your campaigns: to track them in RedTrack and send them to your traffic source campaign. To do that, you need to put these parameters to your affiliate network postback URL. It’s very simple – RedTrack allows you to do that automatically:



1. Go to Offer sources (your Network settings)→ Additional parameters→ put them into the available Parameter fields and the added subs will appear in the Postback URL field→ copy the generated Postback URL:







2. Put the copied Postback URL to your affiliate network postback (preferably under the global postback).





Yes, it is also possible – RedTrack has a set of ‘empty’ parameters exactly for that purpose. Make sure you need it, though: some traffic sources want to receive extra parameters, while most of them do not even require any conversion postback at all.



Your custom parameters for Affiliate Network→ RedTrack→ Traffic Source&nbsp;



{psub1}{psub2}{psub3}{psub4}{psub5}{psub6}{psub7}{psub8}{psub9}{psub10}{psub11}{psub12}{psub13}{psub14}{psub15}{psub16}{psub17}{psub18}{psub19}{psub20}





Assuming you have set the postback integration with your Affiliate Network and it supports additional parameters (in this example – {status} and {targetid}), let’s return to your Traffic Source settings in RedTrack.



We will need to adjust the postback URL with the corresponding parameters:



Your traffic source should support receiving these parameters. In our example, we used {status} and {targetid} macros. To get info on the parameters you can use, ask your account manager.







Simply put, you will see your affiliate network {status} data received via the postback with conversion under your traffic source ‘status’ parameter and {targetid} under the traffic source ‘target_id’ parameter in your traffic source account.

Tips on how to fill in other checkboxes in this window:▸Affiliate partnerships – choose the offer for this postback. With digistore24 you can set different postbacks on different products and several postbacks on the same product.▸For order event – select the events you want to track and see in your RedTrack account▸Postback URL – paste the postback  URL you have copied in your RedTrack account within step 3▸Currency – you have the possibility to convert the payout amount to some other currency on digistore24 side. This could be very useful if your RedTrack account is in USD and you work with all other partners with USD but the offer in digistore24 is paid in EUR. If you set the rule to convert the amount to USD, the payout information in your RedTrack account will be accurate.▸Active – set “yes”▸Email address for error notifications – could be useful in order not to miss any conversion data in case of any errors and fix them immediately.



2.2 Since&nbsp;digistore24&nbsp;allows you to track several different types of events, you can receive those events in your RedTrack account under different columns and thus have even more data to analyze. To do that:




Add these events in RedTrack→ Tools→ Conversion tracking→ Conversion type. Refer to this guide for details.









Those conversion type names should be the same as you have in your&nbsp;digistore24&nbsp;account postback settings. In these settings tick all the needed events: 









Once done, go to your postback settings and update it with the {type} macro: &amp;type={order_type}:








There are 4 different macros supported by digistore24 and all of them can be used for that purpose:{transaction_type} – e.g. payment, refund, chargeback{billing_status} – e.g. paying, completed, aborted{billing_type} – e.g. single_payment, subscription, installment{order_type} – e.g. initial_sale, upsellYou can use all of them as different conversion types in RedTrack (we support up to 20). Add a new postback for this product and simply replace {order_type} with any other from the list. One macro per one postback. So for example, if you want to track {transaction_type}, {order_type}, and {billing_type}, you will need to add 3 different postbacks for that product on the digistore24 side. The names of incoming events should match those you set in your RedTrack conversion types settings (they are case-sensitive).

Payout is the amount you get paid for the conversion.



With RedTrack you can track your conversions in 2 different ways: dynamically and statically.





This method offers you an effective and accurate method of tracking using a dynamic payout token or fixed value in your S2S postback URL or tracking pixel.If your affiliate network supports a dynamic payout token, it will send it back to RedTrack via your postback URL / pixel for each registered conversion via our supported&nbsp;{sum}&nbsp;parameter. 




Networks that have a preset template in RedTrack already have all the needed parameters added.





To add this parameter for the network from scratch go to Offer source → Postback parameters → place the payout tracking macro from your network into the SUM field:








The parameter will vary for each particular network, so please contact your Account manager for the correct one.



Here are some examples of postback URLs with dynamic tokens:▸ Everflow PB URL example: http://yourtrackingdomain?clickid={sub1}&amp;sum={payout_amount}▸ Affise PB URL example: http://rdtrck2.com/postback?clickid={sub1}&amp;sum={sum}▸ HasOffers PB URL example: http://rdtrck2.com/postback?clickid={aff_sub}&amp;sum={payout}▸ CAKE PB URL example: http://rdtrck2.com/postback?clickid=#s2#&amp;sum=#price#









This provides you with an alternative solution if dynamic payout macros aren’t supported by your affiliate network (or advertiser). You can record payout by using a fixed payout value in the offer settings. To set it up go to Offers → Main tab → set the payout value per each registered conversion in the Default conversion revenue field:

Add the created custom clickid to Shopify.




Setup explained





Follow&nbsp;this article&nbsp;to integrate Shopify with RedTrack.



Without following the standard workflow for Shopify ↔ RedTrack integration first, custom clickid setup for counting manual orders won’t work.





1. Create a new Campaign for manual orders to track them, record the click and get the clickid:







2. Record the click and get the clickid. To do that go to the list of your Campaigns → find the campaign created within step 1→ copy the campaign’s link → open this link in another tab to create a click:







3. Go to Logs → Clicks → copy the Click ID value next to the Campaign created within step 1:









Manual orders in Shopify can be added via the app called Metafields Guru. If you don’t have it already, download the Metafields Guru app in your Shopify account.

4.1 On the main Shopify menu go to the section Orders → Create order:







4.2 Fill in all the mandatory fields in the form → scroll down to the end of the form and add the manual order tag to the Tags field → Save:







If you forgot to add a tag when creating an order, you shouldn’t just edit the already existing order by adding the Tag, but instead, follow this workflow:1. Delete all items from the order and save them.2. Add the deleted items again and save them.3. Add the tag to the order.





1. In the Metafields Guru app → Shop:







2. Metafield sets → choose Shop option from the drop-down→ Create set:







3. Put Redtrack in the Label field → press Create:







4. Fill in the mandatory fields → Save:



Values to be inserted:Label=Click id Namespace=redtrackKey=clickid







5. Get back to the main page of the Metafields Guru app → Shop 







6. Go to the tab Redtrack and insert the Click ID value you copied from RedTrack (Setup in RedTrack → step 3) → Save:







7. Create your order and add a “manual order” Tag to link this order with the added clickid. To do that:



7.1 On the main Shopify menu go to the section Orders → Create order:







7.2 Fill in all the mandatory fields in the form → scroll down to the end of the form and add the manual order tag to the Tags field → Save:

14111,Shopify: domain changes,"
If after you've finished the Shopify ↔&nbsp;RedTrack integration your Shopify store domain or/and custom tracking domain were changed you must update these domains in RedTrack and/or Shopify for correct tracking. Act depending on the case:





In Shopify:



1. Replace the outdated custom tracking domain with a new one in the&nbsp;universal tracking script&nbsp;and&nbsp;Events.js script&nbsp;added to theme liquid:







2. Replace the outdated custom tracking domain for upsell tracking. Do this via pixel or legacy scripts depending on your flow: 





Re-add the pixel per the Shopify integration guide (Connection steps → step 2 ""Pixel for tracking upsells"").





Replace current domain with a new one in the additional scripts for the Order status page and Post-purchase page:











If your Shopify domain was somehow changed, you need to update it accordingly in both systems RedTrack and Shopify:





1. Replace the old website URL with the new one (Websites → edit → Main → Website URL):







2. If you work with Facebook, then you should also replace the old&nbsp;Default event URL&nbsp;with a new one (Websites&nbsp;→&nbsp;edit&nbsp;→&nbsp;Capi) and make sure it’s verified on the FB side:









1. Manually replace the old&nbsp;cookie domain&nbsp;with the new one in the&nbsp;universal tracking script&nbsp;added to theme liquid:







2. (if you use legacy scripts for upsell tracking) Manually replace the old cookie domain with the new one in the universal tracking script added to the Post-purchase page:

Snapchat&nbsp;is an American multimedia instant messaging app and service.



Integration





Before you proceed with the integration, make sure to have the already added custom tracking domain.





1. Add Snapchat as a Traffic channel in RedTrack



Traffic channels → New from template → find Snapchat and Add it → Save the template:











So far, Snapchat is integrated with RedTrack by CAPI. Without saving the template first, the system won't be ready for integration, so the conversion data can be lost.



2. Add conversion types to RedTrack.



Tools → Conversion tracking → Conversion types → use&nbsp;this guide&nbsp;to help you add the events.



3. Add pixel, access token, and match the conversion events



3.1 Go to your Snapchat account and copy the values for Pixel ID and Access Token:




To get your Pixel ID go to Assets → Pixels: 













To get your Access Token go to Business Settings → Business details → Conversions API token section → Generate token → copy the generated token:












3.2 Go to the settings of the Snapchat template (added in step 1) → edit → Snapchat default data source (pixel) section → fill in the values for Pixel ID and Access Token:







3.3 Match RedTrack Conversion Types with Snapchat Event Names:







4. Add Offer source and Offer



Use this guide to add your Offer source and Offer. For better conversion attribution in the added Offer source template → Additional parameters assign the following roles:




Phone



Email



First Name



Last Name



Zip Code








5. Create a tracking Campaign in RedTrack



Campaigns → New → use&nbsp;this guide&nbsp;for Affiliates /&nbsp;this guide&nbsp;for Advertisers to help you add the campaign → once your campaign is saved, copy the automatically generated&nbsp;click URL&nbsp;(your tracking link):







We suggest using a no-redirect tracking method (the same is used with Facebook Campaigns) as your ad will most likely be approved without a redirect. 



6. Set up the tracking in Snapchat



6.1 Create Ads → Instant Create:







6.2 Web visits → in the URL field add your main URL + tracking parameters copied from step 5 → Next:







Proceed further with the traffic targeting and payment methods as per your needs. Once you've filled in the fields, click&nbsp;Publish&nbsp;and the ad will go for approval. When your campaign gets published it'll be tracked with RedTrack. 





RedTrack provides you with an opportunity to add Snapchat pixel(s) on the traffic channel level or on the offer/website level. Before you proceed with pixel adjustment consider the following:



☝If you configure the Snapchat CAPI in the traffic channel template, RedTrack will only send conversions from Snapchat to Snapchat.



☝If you configure the Snapchat CAPI in the offer/website template, RedTrack will send to Snapchat all conversions received on that offer/website from different traffic channels, not just Snapchat only. Plus in your offer/website template you can add multiple pixels. 



Do not configure the Snapchat CAPI in both templates - traffic channel and offer/website, or you'll receive duplicated conversions will be duplicated!



Choose the preferred method and act accordingly:





1. Go to your Snapchat account and copy the values for Pixel ID and Access Token:




To get your Pixel ID go to Assets → Pixels:













To get your Access Token go to Business Settings → Business details → Conversions API token section → Generate token → copy the generated token:












2. Go to the settings of the added Snapchat traffic channel template → edit → Snapchat default data source (pixel) section → fill in the values for Pixel ID and Access Token:







3. Match RedTrack Conversion Types with Snapchat Event Names:













1. Go to your Snapchat account and copy the values for Pixel ID and Access Token:




To get your Pixel ID go to Assets → Pixels:













To get your Access Token go to Business Settings → Business details → Conversions API token section → Generate token → copy the generated token:












2. Go to RedTrack → Offers → create the Offer / edit the already created one → tab CAPI → scroll down to the Snapchat section → add the copied pixel(s) and access token(s):







3. Match RedTrack Conversion Types with Snapchat Event Names:

1. Go to your HighLevel account → Automation → Workflows → Create Workflow:







2. Choose Webhook → fill in the mandatory fields → Save action:











Values explained:




Method: POST



URL: RedTrack Webhook URL




The template of the RT Webhook URL is https://defaultrtdomain.rdtk.io/postback/custom/gohighlevel/APIkey where you need to:▸replace defaultrtdomain.rdtk.io with your actual domain:▸ replace APIkey with your actual API key.




Custom data: rtclickid → select hidden custom field {{contact.rtclickid}}




To activate this field click to the tag next to this field → Contact → Custom fields → rtclickid:




Custom data: convtype → define the conversion event you added in RedTrack




If the webhook passes the clickid but does not pass the conversion type or the conversion type does not match the types in RedTrack, the conversion will be recorded in RedTrack as the default conversion type.

Values in the screenshot explained:(1) Give your campaign a name(2) Select the Traffic channel you created within step 5(3) Select the custom tracking domain you added within step 1(4) Select the Website you added within step 4







1. Add the following essential elements to your Retreaver account:




Create a Retreaver Call Tracking Campaign.



Create A Number Pool For Your Campaign (step 2).



Configure Your Number Pool For Real-Time Tracking (step 3).



Tell Retreaver Which Numbers To Replace On Your Landing Page (step 4).




2. Set up parameter mappers for clickid.



Use this guide to adjust the parameter mapper settings → when editing Parameter Mapping, add clickid to Tag Key and URL Parameter fields → Update Campaign:







3. Add scripts to the head section of the page code.



The scripts you add depend on the tracking method you choose:





First you add the universal tracking script, then the Retreaver script. 



1. RedTrack universal tracking script:



Your universal tracking script was created when you did the Setup in RedTrack and can be found in RedTrack → Tools → Scripts. Click here for more info about the universal tracking script in RT.



2. Retreaver script:



Remember to replace the YOUR_CAMPAIGN_KEY element in the script with the actual Retreaver Campaign Key, which can be taken from your Campaign settings → Retreaver JS Settings → Code → Advanced.  Example of the script's part with the replaced Retreaver Campaign Key:var campaign = new Retreaver.Campaign({campaign_key: 'e8d3223ad7cs4gdd59f672tc1ha158j5'});



&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;    (function () {        var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');        scriptElement.type = 'text/javascript';        scriptElement.async = true;        scriptElement.defer = true;        scriptElement.src = document.location.protocol + '//dist.routingapi.com/jsapi/v1/retreaver.min.js';        scriptElement.onload = scriptElement.onreadystatechange = function () {            Retreaver.configure({                host: 'api.routingapi.com',                prefix: document.location.protocol == 'https:' ? 'https' : 'http'            });            var campaign = new Retreaver.Campaign({campaign_key: 'YOUR_CAMPAIGN_KEY'});                        function getRtckValue() {                const clickid = document.cookie.split("";"").map(x =&gt; x.trim()).filter(x =&gt; x.startsWith(""rtkclickid-store""))&#91;0];                return clickid ? clickid.split(""="")&#91;1] : """";            }            console.log(""clickid: "" + getRtckValue());            campaign.request_number(function (number) {                // Store cookie as a tag                number.add_tags({                    clickid: getRtckValue()                });            });        };        (document.getElementsByTagName('head')&#91;0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')&#91;0]).appendChild(scriptElement);    })();&lt;/script&gt;





In Retreaver's case redirect tracking method means adding only Retreaver default script to the head section of the page code. For guidance on how to find Retreaver.js Script go to this article → Accessing the Retreaver.js Script section.





4. Set up webhooks for Retreaver campaign with the condition for webhook to fire (the event).



4.1 In your RedTrack account, go to Offer source/Brand → copy the Postback URL:







4.2 In Retreaver account, go to Campaign settings → Webhooks → Add → choose the condition for the webhook to fire (the event) → paste the Postback URL:







Refer to this article to learn more about webhooks configuration in Retreaver.

15898,Renaming Subs / Aliases for additional parameters in templates,"
RedTrack offers you 20 additional parameters to add to your postback URL. By default these parameters are called subs (sub1, sub2, sub3, etc.). You can easily rename these parameters as per your needs (e.g. utm_source, adname, etc.). To update the naming of the parameters go to the added Traffic channel template → Additional parameters section. If your parameter field is greyed and prevents you from renaming it just remove the assigned role to this parameter → move over to the enabled parameter field and rename it as per your needs → assign the role back → save changes to the template:

16843,Newsbreak and RedTrack,"










Newsbreak is America's leading local news app. The platform consists of thousands of publishing partners and independent contributors. Newsbreak is integrated with RedTrack via API, which allows you to automatically update the costs.



Integration





Before you proceed with the integration, make sure to have the already added:











1. Add Newsbreak template to RedTrack.



1.1 Traffic channels → New from template → find Newsbreak → Add → save the template:











1.2  Change the Cost update depth level (if needed) → Save changes to the template:







Refer to this article for more details on the auto cost update feature.



2. Integrate Newsbreak with RedTrack.



In the added Newsbreak traffic channel template, go to NewsBreak API integration → add the API access token from Newsbreak (the token is provided by Newsbreak support) → Save changes to the template:







Active button means the integration is on:



3. Set up a campaign in RedTrack with Newsbreak as a traffic channel.



3.1 Campaigns → Create new campaign → use&nbsp;this guide&nbsp;if you are an Affiliate/&nbsp;this guide&nbsp;if you are an Advertiser&nbsp;to help you create your campaign with Newsbreak as your traffic channel → once the Campaign is added, your tracking link is automatically created, copy&nbsp;Click URL:







Refer to these articles for more details on the tracking methods available:– Universal script– No-redirect– Impressions



3.2 In your campaign settings enable the Auto update costs toggle → Save changes to the campaign:







 Auto update costs feature allows you to receive your cost data directly from Newsbreak via the API. Refer to this article for more details.



4. Set up the tracking on the Newsbreak side.



4.1 Set up the Postback in Newsbreak. Refer to this article for guidance. 



4.2 Add RT Click URL to the Newsbreak Ad Campaign. 



Create your campaign in Newsbreak → Extra tracking Options → add the Click URL from RedTrack (copied in step 3.1) to the Third party click tracking URL field:







5. Set up the Postback URL in RedTrack.



In RedTrack go to campaign settings (created within step 3) → scroll down to&nbsp;S2S Postback for Newsbreak → Add → replace the conversion_event part with the actual conversion event type → Save changes to the campaign:











Important!If you changed the Postback URL in the Traffic channel (added/removed some parameters to it), remember to manually update the link in Campaign settings as well, as it won’t be generated correctly automatically.Some Traffic channels require you to edit the Postback with specific parameters for each Campaign (e.g., the goal for Exoclick or ap_key for Go2Mobi). If the field remains blank or something like “REPLACE” is stated, that means you need to define the Postback conditions manually.

To find the pixel go to Websites → Scripts → choose Shopify in the E-com integrations drop-down → copy the pixel.



To add the pixel in Shopify:



1. Settings → Customer events → Add custom pixel → give it a name → Add pixel:











2. In the Permission window mark Analytics → in the Data sale window mark Data collected qualifies as data sale:

2. Add the needed scripts and pixel.





1. Copy the scripts from the added Website form (Websites→choose the needed one→Scripts→choose Shopify→copy the scripts):









If you have the Offer form and no automatically generated scripts, then you need to:




Create and copy the universal tracking script. Use this article → I'm affiliate section.



Copy this Web events tracking Events.js script:




&lt;script src=""https://yourtrackingdomain.com/events.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;





2. Add the copied scripts to your Shopify account.



2.1 Sales channels → Online Store → Themes → three dots → Edit code:







2.2 Layout → theme.liquid → add the copied scripts to the end of the&nbsp;&lt;head&gt;&nbsp;tag:







If you change the theme, remember to add the scripts to the new theme again.





1. Copy the pixel from the Website form (Websites→choose the needed one→Scripts→choose Shopify→copy the Pixel for order status page and post-purchase page):







Legacy scripts for Order status page and Post purchase page can be still found in your Website form in the Legacy scripts for Order status page and Post-Purchase page drop-down:

17566,Clicks inconsistency,"
Click inconsistency can be presented in the following ways: - Traffic channel is showing higher clicks amount compared to RedTrack.- RedTrack is showing higher clicks amount compared to traffic channel data.- No clicks in RedTrack.- There are clicks but they are attributed to the wrong campaign.



Here is what can be checked/done in these situations:






Check if the tracking links have all the necessary parameters and set properly.



If the tracking script is used, make sure it is fired.



Check if the time zones are the same in both systems.



Make sure the traffic channel is not sending you bot traffic (by analysing reports, IPs, etc.).



Check if you have set campaign filters or offer caps by mistake.



Your traffic channel might have many redirects which slow down the system (e.g: there are a lot of their internal redirects before the visitor is redirected to your tracking URL, as a result – he quits the page before the click comes to RedTrack).



Check if the custom tracking domain is up and running.




If everything is okay with your RedTrack settings, we cannot control the number of clicks in your traffic channel and cannot provide the reason for such a discrepancy on their side. 



What can be done: go to RedTrack → Logs → Clicks → choose the time period → export the clicks log report and ask your traffic channel account manager for advice.&nbsp;






Check if the correct links with correct parameters are used on the traffic channel side.



Check if the clicks coming from the traffic channel contain the dynamic parameters (this can be done in logs).



Make sure there is no bot or organic traffic coming to the paid traffic campaign.



Exclude the time zone difference.



If the tracking script is used, make sure it is triggered on the page only once.




RedTrack tracks the number of visits to your campaigns. Since we are not integrated with your traffic channel, we do not get the numbers of clicks reported by their system directly. The primary purpose of tracking is to track&nbsp;all visits&nbsp;going through your campaign URL/website/shop, no matter what is shown in the traffic channel.Analyse your&nbsp;reports&nbsp;for the different data slices to check your click parameters.






Check if the tracking links are set correctly if you work with redirect method.



Check and ensure the scripts are correct and are fired properly on the page for no redirect method.



Make sure the tracking domain is up and running.



Exclude clicks being redirected to the organic campaign.







Check if the correct tracking links are used on the traffic channel side - each contains the unique campaign id, it should be the one you attribute your traffic to.



If it is a no redirect tracking, check for the correct tracking parameter to be used on the traffic channel side or in the script itself.

17596,Cost/Ad spend: troubleshoot,"
Depending on what is the initial problem: no costs at all or the data is coming but it is incorrect, the troubleshoot checklist may differ.





Here is what you need to check on your side:



1. The traffic channel should be connected from the template. No error is shown for API integrations. If it is not connected or you are not sure, re-connect it.



2. The correct account is connected. It should be the one you run your traffic from (the admin account if you are an invited user).



3. Issue with dynamic parameters.




For API integrations: the dynamic parameters such as campaign id, adset id and ad id are received by RedTrack (Logs → Clicks → check sub values; Report → campaign id, adset id or ad id grouping). If there are no parameters in click logs, we are not receiving them from your traffic channel. Either these are your test clicks, or you need to check the traffic channel campaign settings to have the parameters string in place.



For non-API integrations: make sure your traffic channel supports the dynamic parameter for costs and it is added to the tracking link.




4. For API-integrations: the correct roles are assigned to the dynamic parameters. For the cost update to work properly, the following roles should be assigned to the ids in your traffic channel settings:







5. Check the cost model you use in the campaign settings (should be CPC) and if the Auto-update cost toggle (for API integrations) is on inside the campaign settings.



If, after checking/doing all the suggested actions, you still experience the problem with the costs not coming, email to support@redtrack.io for assistance.





Some of the points below can be applied to API integrations only, but the logic is similar for any cost inconsistency troubleshooting.



What you can check to understand why the cost data is incomplete (higher or lower than the one you have on the traffic channel):



1. The first thing you need to compare is the IDs. RedTrack takes the cost data per ID (campaign, ad set, or ad, depending on your subscription level), so if some ID is missing, its cost data will not be included in your RedTrack report.



Check if all IDs are received in RedTrack (campaign report → group by (target ID used for the cost update) → check the list). If not, check this campaign, adset or ad in your traffic channel and ensure the dynamic parameters are added to pass the ID.



2. Check if the correct roles are assigned to the traffic channel IDs in RedTrack. This can be checked in your traffic channel settings:







Make sure to have only one parameter per these roles assigned. There cannot be 2 Aids per traffic channel.



3. Check if the time zones match in your RedTrack account setting and the traffic channel.



The timezone of the cost data received via the API can be checked in your cost logs. If the timezones of your traffic channel and RedTrack don't match or the timezones within your ad accounts in the traffic channel do not match (for example, when you run traffic from different ad accounts to one RedTrack campaign), cost data matching is impossible.







4. Check the cost logs in RedTrack: if costs stopped coming for some time and caused this discrepancy, you might need to reconnect the traffic channel.



5. Make sure the currency matches in both systems.



6. Check if the click numbers match in both systems.

What are Columns in RedTrack?



Columns in RedTrack is our analytical data processing system. The Columns functionality in a report organizes and displays collected data, structuring it based on the selected data slice, thereby allowing for easier analysis and interpretation.



Each report in RT has a different set of columns you've set (e.g. the same types of columns set in the Campaign report won't be by default added to your Traffic channel report, unless you set them up exactly the same).



This table will show which reports/sections of the RT tool have columns and whether they are customizable:



Report/SectionColumns can be added/removed from/to the template lists (yes/no)Possibility to add custom columns with metrics (yes/no)Ads ManagerYesYesAutomated rulesNoNoConversion pathNoNoReports:CampaignOffersTraffic channelsOffer sourcesIP reportYesYesLandersYesYesLogs:ClicksConversionsS2S PostbacksAPI PostbacksCost updatesYesNo



Manipulations with columns



1. To access column settings press the Columns icon in the needed report/section:







2. Adjust columns as per your needs:





1. To add the column to the report go to the grey list of the columns on your left → press arrow next to it → Save changes to the column settings:











2. To remove the column from the report go to the green list of the columns on your right → press arrow next to it → Save changes to the column settings:











3. You can arrange the set of columns in templates for convenience. So far RT functionality allows you to collect 3 types of templates and all of them you can customize (add/remove/highlight the preferred columns) as per your needs:









With the help of custom columns you can create and configure additional columns in a data table to suit your specific needs, enabling more personalized data organization and analysis.



To add a custom column:



1. Go to Columns → Add custom column → fill in the mandatory fields → enter the formula for your custom column → Save new column:







2. Once it's created it'll be added to the grey list of columns, add this column to the green list of columns (active columns) → Save column settings to apply the changes to the report table:









RedTrack functionality allows you to highlight certain rows based on the chosen column value. It can be done in 2 ways (choose the preferred one):





To highlight rows via Toggles go to the needed report/section → columns settings → identify the preferred value for the system you need to switch on the toggle in the chosen column.



Example: You decided to turn on the Total ROI toggle:







So now your report is highlighted based on the Total ROI data:







You can turn on only 1 toggle (choose only one value based on which the rows will be highlighted) per one report. That being said, you can choose a different toggle (another value based on which the rows will be highlighted) in another report. For example: you turned on the Cost toggle for Campaigns report, so your rows will be highlighted based on the cost data in the Campaigns report. Then you went to the Offers  report and turned on the Total ROI toggle, so your rows will be highlighted based on the total ROI data in the Offers report.



If you want to set up the colours in all the templates and all the reports and manage it in one place hover to the ""via Workplace settings"" tab.





To manage the highlight of rows and set them up for all the reports and templates in one place go to burger menu → Settings → Workplace → Control the color of the rows → next to each report choose the preferred value based on which the rows will be highlighted → Save changes: 











To change the format of the displayed data go to burger menu → Settings → Workspace → choose the quantity of numbers after the divider → select the needed divider (dot or comma) → Save changes:









To adjust the table layout:



1. Press the Density button in the chosen report:







2. Set the preferred mode:

18387,Ads Manager draft,"
What's Ads Manager?



Ads Manager tab in RedTrack provides information about where your traffic originates based on RT_roles that you can set up for all your tracking links. The idea behind the report is to have all the data across all campaigns presented in a familiar layout for advertisers who are used to working with Facebook / Google Analytics reports.



RT_roles should be configured in the traffic channel template (in most templates the roles are already in place):



Parameter Name/DescriptionRoleCampaign IDCidAdgroup IDGidAd IDAidPlacement IDPid







Ads Manager is available for all traffic channels, but only several of them are eligible for automation at the moment:- Meta (Facebook): manage objects with ID (campaign, adset, ad) and manage daily budget.- TikTok: manage objects with ID (campaign, adset, ad).



If Ads Manager or certain features within it are not visible/available in your account please contact sales@redtrack.io.



How to work with Ads Manager



1. On the main RedTrack menu go to Ads Manager → press cogwheel to manage (add/delete) the data slices (RT_toles):







2. Within the chosen data slice you can:





To analyse the report within a chosen data slice, filter it by Date → needed Offer/ Brand or Traffic channel or simply Search by ID object/ID → press Apply/Refresh: 









You can decide yourself which columns you want to see in the report. To customize your columns click on this icon: 







Refer to the Columns guide for details about this functionality.





This feature is currently available only for Facebook and TikTok.



If you update the budget on the FB side, in RedTrack the actual data (status) will be updated every 30 minutes.



Without going to your Facebook/TikTok account you can enable or disable objects with ID (API integration works by Campaign ID, Adgroup and Ad ID) in RedTrack via Ads manager. To do that you need to enable/disable the ON/OFF toggle next to the needed object:









This feature is currently available only for Facebook. 



If you update the budget on the FB side, in RedTrack the actual data (daily budget) will be updated every 30 minutes.



In the Daily budget column you can change the budget amount at the Campaign or Adgroup level depending on the settings. To do that click on the pencil icon → add the budget amount in the modal window → click Save to apply the changes:

19252,RSOC,"
What's RSOC?



RSOC (Referrer Source of Conversion) method is used to identify and track the specific source of traffic that leads to a conversion (sale, lead, purchase, etc.). In RedTrack this attribution method is relevant for customers who want to send conversions to RedTrack via postback, but the conversions do not have our rtclickid. In other words you should use it to attribute conversions when a unique clickid is unavailable. With this attribution method, conversions will be recorded on the last click corresponding to the values specified in the new rsoc_id parameter.



Example of your typical Postback URL with the RSOC attribution method will look like this: https://tracking.domain/postback?rsoc_id=12a3456789bc12b345de67fg-1234-123&amp;type=Lead. In this postback:- tracking.domain is the name of your actual tracking domain. - rsoc_id=12a3456789bc12b345de67fg is RedTrack campaign id (put instead of the campaign_id parameter). - 1234 is your traffic channel campaign id (put instead of the rt_campaign_id parameter, which is added to the traffic channel settings → Additional parameters → sub with the assigned Cid role)- 123 is your traffic channel ad id (put instead of the rt_campaign_id parameter, which is added to the traffic channel settings → Additional parameters → sub with the assigned Aid role)- type=Lead is the conversion type you've added in RT and want to track.- ""-"" sign between the elements of the postback serves to separate the values for parameters, it's there for the correct URL syntax purposes.



RSOC attribution method will work in several scenarios/combinations. Postback URL will look differently depending on the chosen scenario: 



RSOC attribution method combinationResulting Postback URL example with the values in placersoc_id={campaign_id}-{rt_campaign_id}-{rt_ad_id}https://tracking.domain/postback?rsoc_id=12a3456789bc12b345de67fg-1234-123&amp;type=Leadrsoc_id={campaign_id}-{rt_campaign_id} https://tracking.domain/postback?rsoc_id=12a3456789bc12b345de67fg-1234&amp;type=Leadrsoc_id={campaign_id}-{rt_ad_id} https://tracking.domain/postback?rsoc_id=12a3456789bc12b345de67fg-123&amp;type=Leadrsoc_id={campaign_id}https://tracking.domain/postback?rsoc_id=12a3456789bc12b345de67fg&amp;type=Lead



How to enable the RSOC feature



1. RedTrack → Traffic channels → settings of the added traffic channel template → Additional parameters → assign Cid role to the campaign_id parameter and Aid to the ad_id parameter. Parameters with the assigned roles are added depending on the chosen RSOC attribution combination:



RSOC attribution method combinationParameter + the assigned role in the traffic channel templatersoc_id={campaign_id}-{rt_campaign_id}-{rt_ad_id}rsoc_id={campaign_id}-{rt_campaign_id} rsoc_id={campaign_id}-{rt_ad_id} rsoc_id={campaign_id}No need to add any parameters or assign roles.



2. In the added campaign settings enable the RSOC toggle → Save changes to the campaign template:







- If the toggle is off, only conversions with rtclickid will be counted. - If the toggle is on, both conversions with rtclickid and rsocid are counted, they do not cancel each other out.

1.1 Follow&nbsp;this guide&nbsp;on how to integrate Google Tag Manager (GTM) with RedTrack.



Make sure you’ve created a 1st party cookie variable under the name rtkclickid-store. Without this variable, further GTM integration with RT will not work out.



1.2  In GTM settings Create 3 types of Tags: 





Essential elements:




Tag&nbsp; = Custom HTML



Triggering = All Pages (Page view)




Script:



Use the universal tracking script for this.

now.setTime(now.getTime() + expires * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);

cookie += ""; expires="" + now.toUTCString();

}

 

document.cookie = cookie;

}

&lt;/script&gt;





2. Connect&nbsp;GTM&nbsp;to Typeform



For the integration to work, you need to connect GTM to each added form in your Typeform account. According to the Typeform guidelines, you can add Google Tag Manager to a form only if you have a Business Typeform account. 



2.1&nbsp;Copy your&nbsp;Google Tag Manager Container ID.



2.2&nbsp;Go to your Typeform account → open the needed form → activate the tab&nbsp;Connect → Integrations → find&nbsp;Google Tag Manager → Connect:

19478,Increasing the event match quality,"
Why I need this feature



If you work with an affiliate offer, having a 10/10 match quality is impossible. Every network has a list of parameters it wants to receive, but only  half of them can be covered by any third-party tool. Absence of the required parameters causes low match quality level. And it’s not something you should struggle with.



RedTrack has a feature that can help you improve the event match quality with your network. It does not take any additional values from the network itself, but if you have them on your website/affiliate network side (for example, order ID at Shopify) or store them on your side, you can send them to RedTrack and back to the network to increase the event match quality. This feature is enabled by adding additional parameters for data enhancement to the Offer source / Brand template settings and assigning relevant roles to them. 



Important!- Before working with additional parameters for data enhancement, contact your Account manager to clarify which parameters can / should be sent and processed on your platform’s side. You must be sure that the website (affiliate network) is able to send additional target parameters.- If you do not work with any offer source and promote your offers, this feature can be used only if you store the data on your side and have the technical capabilities to add this data to the conversion triggered.



How to add additional parameters and assign roles to them



1. Make RedTrack identify and accept this data with a postback first



Offer sources / Brands → Additional parameters → add the required parameters, macro, name and assign the roles: 







Mandatory fields: ◉ Macro/Token: insert {r} or {replace}.◉ Role: assign your parameters a certain role. This list of roles for parameters is fully supported and recorded (processed) in RedTrack:Optional fields: ◉ Parameter: that’s where you give your parameter a name, but can leave it empty and in the tracking URL your parameters will be called sub1,2,3 etc.◉ Name / Description: that’s the name you’ll see in the reports instead of sub1,2,3. For your convenience you can customize these names as you wish.



2. The added parameters will be appended to the Postback URL which you should copy:







3. Paste it in your offer source S2S postback settings as usual (or in any other postback option you use on your side).



That's it. Once the conversion postback containing those values is sent to RedTrack, we will grab it, attribute it to the appropriate campaign, and send it to your network with the specified role.

20375,Highlevel and RedTrack,"




HighLevel&nbsp;(aka&nbsp;GoHighLevel/ High Level/ GHL) positions as the go-to solution for agencies. It is an all-in-one tech stack for agencies or marketers, eliminating the need for other tools.



Integration





1. Add&nbsp;custom tracking domain.



2. Set up&nbsp;conversion tracking.



3. Add your&nbsp;Brand and Website&nbsp;(for Advertisers) /&nbsp;Offer source and Offer&nbsp;(for Affiliates).



When you add the brand/offer source, in the Additional parameters section remember to add {r} to Macro/Token fields and assign the following roles:- First Name- Last Name- Phone- Email



4. Create a paid traffic campaign.



– For Advertisers, the campaign for unattributed (organic) traffic will already be in place once you've added your website.– Affiliates should add the campaign for the unattributed (organic) traffic per this guide.



To create a campaign for the paid traffic follow these simple steps:




Add the Traffic channel (API integrated traffic channels/Non-API integrated traffic channels). Most of them have a preset template in RedTrack.



Launch a campaign&nbsp;for the paid traffic channel. Your website/shop will be the main link added to the traffic channel. Be guided by&nbsp;this article&nbsp;for Advertisers /&nbsp;this one&nbsp;for Affiliates.






1. Add RedTrack Webhook URL to HighLevel. 



For those who don’t have a Workflows&nbsp;tab, there is a workaround to set it up via the Triggers&nbsp;tab. Act as follows depending on your case:





1. Copy the GoHighLevel URL webhook from your RedTrack account.



RedTrack → Tools → Integrations → Offer sources → copy the GoHighLevel URL webhook:











2. Add the copied webhook to HighLevel. 



2.1 Your HighLevel account → Automation → Workflows → Create Workflow:







2.2 Press ""+' → select the action Webhook:











2.3 Fill in the mandatory fields → enable the Publish toggle → Save Action: 







Values in the screenshot explained: 



(1) Method: POST



(2) URL: paste the GoHighLevel URL webhook from your RedTrack account (copied in step 1)



(3), (4) In the Custom data section add the following items:




Key: rtclickid, Value: {{contact.rtclickid}}



Key: convtype, Value: conversion event you added in RedTrack, in our example it's ""Purchase"".




If the webhook passes the clickid but does not pass the conversion type or the conversion type does not match the types in RedTrack, the conversion will be recorded in RedTrack as the default conversion type.



(5) Enable the Publish toggle, otherwise, the webhook action will not be triggered.



(6) Press Save Action to apply the changes.





1. In your RedTrack account go to Tools → Integrations → Offer sources → copy the GoHighLevel URL webhook:











2. Go to your HighLevel account →&nbsp;Automation → Triggers →&nbsp;Add Trigger:







3. In the pop-up window give your&nbsp;Trigger&nbsp;a name → select the folder you want to put it in →&nbsp;Save:







4. Paste the generated RT webhook URL to the form → select&nbsp;Active:









2. Set up your funnel.



Settings are implemented for one funnel and form at a time. Thus, if you want to track several funnels and forms, you need to adjust them separately, since the same settings are not applied to all of them by default. 



2.1 Sites → choose the needed funnel → edit → Settings → Body tracking code field → paste RT universal tracking script → Save:











3. Adjust the Form within the funnel.



This setup is valid for HighLevel-based forms only. It may not work out for third-party platform forms. 



Within the already adjusted funnel go to Forms → choose the needed one → edit:







Within the form add the following:





1. Styles and Options →  Advanced Settings: 







2. Custom CSS → add the piece of code below → Save:



input&#91;data-q=""rtclickid""] {
  display: none;
}









1. Add Form Element → Custom Fields → select Contact from the drop-down → Add:







Single Line → Save:







Fill in the mandatory fields in the popped-up form:




Name: rtclickid



Placeholder: {clickid}



Object and Group: Contact








2. Drag the created contact element  to the Form → navigate to this element in the form with your mouse → in the settings on your right do the following:




erase the Label name



make sure Placeholder = {clickid} value and Query Key&nbsp;= rtclickid










1. Add Form Element → Quick Add → drag the Html element to the main Form → navigate to this element in the form with your mouse → Edit HTML: 







2. Add the code below → Yes, Save it → Save the changes to the Form overall:



&lt;script&gt;
  // Function to get the value of a specific cookie
function getCookie(name) {
    const value = document.cookie;
    const parts = value.split(`; ${name}=`);
    if (parts.length === 2) return parts.pop().split(';').shift();
}

// Function to fill the input field and dispatch the event
function fillInputField() {
    const cookieValue = getCookie('rtkclickid-store');
    if (cookieValue) {
        const inputField = document.querySelector('&#91;data-q=""rtclickid""]');
        if (inputField) {
            inputField.value = cookieValue;

            // Create and dispatch the input event
            const event = new Event('input', {
                bubbles: true,
                cancelable: true,
            });
            inputField.dispatchEvent(event);
        }
    }
}

fillInputField()
&lt;/script&gt;







It's important that the script element is to be added after the clickid element in the form:

20671,digistore update from Sof (conv types),"
Important insights about Digistore24 conversion tracking!1. Digistore24 allows you to track conversions in 2 ways: by adding to the end of the postback URL dynamic macros supported by digistore24 or &amp;type=yourconvtypename. You can combine the two ways or use only one of them. But mind that the workflow for setting up conversions tracking via each way is different.2. There is a special workflow for Initiate Checkout event tracking. The details for each case are described below↓





1. Study the correlation between Digistore24-supported dynamic macros and the events you should add in RedTrack.



Digistore24 supports 4 dynamic macros. Each macro corresponds to the events you want to track with its help:




{transaction_type}&nbsp;= payment, refund, chargeback.



{order_type}&nbsp;= initial_sale, upsell.



{billing_type}&nbsp;= single_payment, subscription, installment



{billing_status}&nbsp;= paying, completed, aborted.




Use only the macros corresponding to the conversion types you want to track. You don't need to add all of them if that's not your case.



So if you want to track such events as ""payment, refund and chargeback"" you should add them to RedTrack and add {transaction_type} macro to the end of the Postback URL in digistore24. Use this table for a reference:



Events I want to trackWhat I need to add to RedTrackMacro I should add to the Postback URL in Digistore24paymentrefundchargebackpaymentrefundchargeback{transaction_type}initial_saleupsellinitial_saleupsell{order_type}single_paymentsubscriptioninstallmentsingle_paymentsubscriptioninstallment{billing_type}payingcompletedabortedpayingcompletedaborted{billing_status}



2. Add the events you want to track with Digistore24 in RedTrack. To do that go to Tools → Conversion tracking → Conversion type. Refer to&nbsp;this guide&nbsp;for details.







Event names in RT should be the same as they are spelled in Digistore24 (small letters, with or no spaces, etc.)



3. Add the needed macro(s) to the end of your Postback URL in Digistore24.





1. In your digistore24 account go to Account → S2S postback → Add s2s postback integration:







2. Add the copied postback URL from RT to the Postback URL field → add the needed macro to the end of the URL string → mark the needed events in the For order event field → Save:







It goes one macro per one postback. To add another macro, you need to add another postback. 





This video tutorial will help you set up the postback on the digistore24 side if you have a vendor account (e-com setup)







You can use a custom name for the event you want to track. To do that:



1. Add the event(s) you want to track with Digistore24 in RedTrack. To do that go to Tools → Conversion tracking → Conversion type. Refer to&nbsp;this guide&nbsp;for details.







2. Add this event to the end of your Postback URL in Digistore24 and mark the proxy type event supported by Digistore24.





1. In your digistore24 account go to Account → S2S postback → Add s2s postback integration:







2. Add the copied postback URL from RT to the Postback URL field → add &amp;type=conveventname → mark the needed event in the For order event field → Save:







In the ""For order event"" field you tick the event that logically matches the custom event type in the postback URL.



It goes one event per one postback. To add another event, you need to add another postback. 





This video tutorial will help you set up the postback on the digistore24 side if you have a vendor account (e-com setup).







In RedTrack



Go to Tools → Conversion tracking → Conversion type → add Initiate Checkout → Save:

Introduction



Search arbitrage is a lucrative online marketing strategy that involves purchasing traffic from search engines and directing that traffic to different monetizing platforms such as affiliate programs or ad networks. The goal is to earn more from the monetization than spent on acquiring that traffic.



Understanding Search Traffic



Search traffic refers to visitors who find your website through search engines like Google, Bing, or Yahoo.

Sedo is a marketplace for buying and selling domains. In the context of search arbitrage, you may want to acquire high-traffic, descriptive domains that can attract visitors from search engines. Optimize these domains to improve your chances of earning higher revenue through redirects or affiliate links.



Setting Up RedTrack.io for Search Arbitrage

2. Set Up a New Campaign



Go to the campaigns section and create a new campaign. Enter essential details such as the campaign name and traffic source.

Choose settings that match your advertising methods. You can set up postbacks to track conversions and manage ROI more effectively.

Use RedTrack’s dashboard to monitor your campaign metrics. Keep an eye on your ROI, conversion rates, and traffic sources to optimize your strategy.
